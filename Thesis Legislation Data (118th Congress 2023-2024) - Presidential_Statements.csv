"Oct 07, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-hamas-attacks-against-israel,Statement on the Hamas Attacks Against Israel,"""This morning I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu about the horrific and ongoing attacks in Israel. The United States unequivocally condemns this appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and I made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the Government and people of Israel. Terrorism is never justified. Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. The United States warns against any other party hostile to Israel seeking advantage in this situation. My administration's support for Israel's security is rock solid and unwavering.
Jill and I are keeping in our prayers all of the families who have been hurt by this violence. We are heartbroken by the lives that have been tragically cut short and hope for a swift recovery for all those who have been wounded.
My team and I are tracking this situation closely, and I will remain in close touch with Prime Minister Netanyahu."""
"Oct 07, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-hamas-attacks-against-israel-0,Remarks on the Hamas Attacks Against Israel,"""The President. Good afternoon.
Today the people of Israel are under attack, orchestrated by a terrorist organization, Hamas.
In this moment of tragedy, I want to say to them and to the world and to terrorists everywhere that the United States stands with Israel. We will not ever fail to have their back. We'll make sure that they have the help their citizens need and they can continue to defend themselves.
You know, the world's seen appalling images: thousands of rockets in the space of hours raining down on Israeli cities. When I got up this morning and started this at 7:30, 8 o'clock—my calls—Hamas terrorists crossing into Israel killing not only Israeli soldiers, but Israeli civilians in the street, in their homes. Innocent people murdered, wounded, entire families taken hostage by Hamas just days after Israel marked the holiest of days on the Jewish calendar. It's unconscionable.
You know, when I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu this morning, I told him the United States stands with the people of Israel in the face of these terrorist assaults. Israel has the right to defend itself and its people. Full stop.
There is never justification for terrorist attacks.
And my administration's support for Israel's security is rock solid and unwavering.
Let me say this as clearly as I can: This is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage. The world is watching.
I've also been in contact with the King of Jordan, spoken with Members of Congress, directed my national security team to engage with their Israeli counterparts—military to military, intelligence to intelligence, diplomat to diplomat—to make sure Israel has what it needs.
I've also directed my team to remain in constant contact with leaders throughout the region, including Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Oman, the U.A.E., as well as with our European partners and the Palestinian Authority.
This is also a terrible tragedy on a human level. It's hurting innocent people—seeing the lives that have been broken by this, the families torn apart. It's heart breaking.
And Jill and I are praying for those families who have been impacted by this violence. We grieve with those who have lost their loved ones, lost a piece of their soul. We have hope for a swift recovery for many who have been wounded.
But we're going to remain in close touch with Prime Minister—I, personally, am going to remain in close contact with Prime Minister Netanyahu as this situation continues to develop.
And let there be no mistake: The United States stands with the State of Israel, just as we have from the moment the United States became the first nation to recognize Israel, 11 minutes after its founding, 75 years ago.
Thank you very much.
Q. Mr. President, was there an intelligence failure in the lead-up to this attack?
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us what Bibi asked you, specifically, for support?"""
"Oct 09, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-united-states-citizens-impacted-the-hamas-attacks-against-israel,Statement on the United States Citizens Impacted by the Hamas Attacks Against Israel,"""As we continue to account for the horrors of the appalling terrorist assault against Israel this weekend and the hundreds of innocent civilians who were murdered, we are seeing the immense scale and reach of this tragedy. Sadly, we now know that at least 11 American citizens were among those killed, many of whom made a second home in Israel.
It's heart wrenching. These families have been torn apart by inexcusable hatred and violence. We also know that American citizens still remain unaccounted for, and we are working with Israeli officials to obtain more information as to their whereabouts. My heart goes out to every family impacted by the horrible events of the past few days. The pain these families have endured, the enormity of their loss, and the agony of those still awaiting information is unfathomable.
The safety of American citizens, whether at home or abroad, is my top priority as President. While we are still working to confirm, we believe it is likely that American citizens may be among those being held by Hamas. I have directed my team to work with their Israeli counterparts on every aspect of the hostage crisis, including sharing intelligence and deploying experts from across the United States Government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage recovery efforts.
For American citizens who are currently in Israel, the State Department is providing consular assistance as well as updated security alerts. For those who desire to leave, commercial flights and ground options are still available. Please also take sensible precautions in the days ahead, and follow the guidance of local authorities.
This is not some distant tragedy. The ties between Israel and the United States run deep. It is personal for so many American families who are feeling the pain of this attack as well as the scars inflicted through millennia of anti-Semitism and persecution of Jewish people. In cities across the country, police departments have stepped up security around centers of Jewish life, and the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other Federal law enforcement partners are closely monitoring for any domestic threats in connection with the horrific terrorist attacks in Israel.
In this moment of heartbreak, the American people stand shoulder to shoulder with Israelis. We remember the pain of being attacked by terrorists at home, and Americans across the country stand united against these evil acts that have once more claimed innocent American lives. It is an outrage. And we will continue to show the world that the American people are unwavering in our resolve to oppose terrorism in all forms.
The United States and the State of Israel are inseparable partners, and I affirmed to Prime Minister Netanyahu again when we spoke yesterday that the United States will continue to make sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself and its people."""
"Oct 09, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-president-emmanuel-macron-france-chancellor-olaf-scholz,"Joint Statement by President Biden, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, and Prime Minister Sunak of the United Kingdom on the Situation in Israel","""Today, we—President Macron of France, Chancellor Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister Meloni of Italy, Prime Minister Sunak of the United Kingdom, and President Biden of the United States—express our steadfast and united support to the State of Israel, and our unequivocal condemnation of Hamas and its appalling acts of terrorism.
We make clear that the terrorist actions of Hamas have no justification, no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned. There is never any justification for terrorism. In recent days, the world has watched in horror as Hamas terrorists massacred families in their homes, slaughtered over 200 young people enjoying a music festival, and kidnapped elderly women, children, and entire families, who are now being held as hostages.
Our countries will support Israel in its efforts to defend itself and its people against such atrocities. We further emphasize that this is not a moment for any party hostile to Israel to exploit these attacks to seek advantage.
All of us recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, and support equal measures of justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike. But make no mistake: Hamas does not represent those aspirations, and it offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed.
Over the coming days, we will remain united and coordinated, together as allies, and as common friends of Israel, to ensure Israel is able to defend itself, and to ultimately set the conditions for a peaceful and integrated Middle East region."""
"Oct 10, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-hamas-attacks-against-israel,Remarks on the Hamas Attacks Against Israel,"""The President. Good afternoon.
You know, there are moments in this life—and I mean this literally—when the pure, unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world. The people of Israel lived through one such moment this weekend. The bloody hands of the terrorist organization Hamas, a group whose stated purpose for being is to kill Jews.
This was an act of sheer evil. More than 1,000 civilians slaughtered—not just killed, slaughtered—in Israel. Among them, at least 14 American citizens killed.
Parents butchered using their bodies to try to protect their children. Stomach-turning reports of being—babies being killed. Entire families slain.
Young people massacred while attending a musical festival to celebrate peace—to celebrate peace. Women raped, assaulted, paraded as trophies. Families hid their fear for hours and hours, desperately trying to keep their children quiet to avoid drawing attention.
And thousands of wounded, alive, but carrying with them the bullet holes and the shrapnel wounds and the memory of what they endured. You all know these traumas never go away.
There are still so many families desperately waiting to hear the fate of their loved ones, not knowing if they're alive or dead or hostages.
Infants in their mothers' arms, grandparents in wheelchairs, Holocaust survivors abducted and held hostage, hostages whom Hamas has now threatened to execute in violation of every code of human morality.
It's abhorrent. The brutality of Hamas—this bloodthirstiness—brings to mind the worst—the worst rampages of ISIS. This is terrorism.
But sadly, for the Jewish people, it's not new. This attack has brought to the surface painful memories and the scars left by a millennia of anti-Semitism and genocide of the Jewish people.
So, in this moment, we must be crystal clear: We stand with Israel. We stand with Israel. And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and respond to this attack.
There is no justification for terrorism. There is no excuse.
Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination. Its stated purpose is the annihilation of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people. They use Palestinian civilians as human shields. Hamas offers nothing but terror and bloodshed, with no regard to who pays the price.
The loss of innocent life is heartbreaking.
Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond—indeed has a duty to respond—to these vicious attacks. I just got off the phone with—the third call with Prime Minister Netanyahu. And I told him if the United States experienced what Israel is experiencing, our response would be swift, decisive, and overwhelming.
We also discussed how democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger and more secure when we act according to the rule of law. Terrorists purposefully target civilians, kill them. We uphold the laws of war—the law of war. It matters. There's a difference.
Today Americans across the country are praying for all those families that have been ripped apart. A lot of us know how it feels. It leaves a black hole in your chest when you lose family, feeling like you're being sucked in. The anger, the pain, the sense of hopelessness.
This is what they mean by a ""human tragedy,"" an atrocity on an appalling scale.
But we're going to continue to stand united, supporting the people of Israel who are suffering unspeakable losses and opposing the hatred and violence of terrorism.
My team has been in near constant communication with our Israeli partners and partners all across the region and the world from the moment this crisis began.
We're surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome. We're going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens.
My administration has consulted closely with Congress throughout this crisis. And when Congress returns, we're going to ask them to take urgent action to fund the national security requirements of our critical partners.
This is not about party or politics. This is about the security of our world, the security of the United States of America.
We now know that American citizens are among those being held by Hamas. I've directed my team to share intelligence and deploy additional experts from across the United States Government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts on hostage recovery efforts, because as President I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world.
The United States has also enhanced our military force posture in the region to strengthen our deterrence. The Department of Defense has moved the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Eastern Mediterranean and bolstered our fighter aircraft presence. And we stand ready to move in additional assets as needed.
Let me say again, to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don't. Don't.
Our hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear.
Yesterday I also spoke with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K. to discuss the latest developments with our European allies and coordinate our united response. This comes on top of days of steady engagement with partners across the region.
We're also taking steps at home. In cities across the United States of America, police departments have stepped up security around centers for—of Jewish life. And the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working closely with State and local law enforcement and Jewish community partners to identify and disrupt any domestic threat that could emerge in connection with these horrific attacks.
This is a moment for the United States to come together, to grieve with those who are mourning. Let's be real clear: There is no place for hate in America—not against Jews, not against Muslims, not against anybody. We reject—we reject—what we reject is terrorism. We condemn the indiscriminate evil, just as we've always done.
That's what America stands for.
You know, just over 50 years ago—I was thinking about it this morning, talking with the Secretary of State, the Vice President in my office and—over 50 years ago, as a young Senator, I visited Israel for the first time, as a newly elected Senator.
And I had a long, long trip—or meeting with Golda Meir in her office just before the Yom Kippur War. And I guess she could see the consternation on my face as she described what was being faced—they were facing.
We walked outside in that sort of hallway outside her office to have some photos. She looked at me and we—all of a sudden and said, ""Would you like to have a photograph?"" And so, I got up and followed her out.
We were standing there silent, looking at the press. She could tell, I guess, I was concerned. She leaned over and whispered to me, she said: ""Don't worry, Senator Biden. We have a secret weapon here in Israel""—my word this is what she said—""We have no place else to go."" ""We have no place else to go.""
For 75 years, Israel has stood as the ultimate guarantor of security of Jewish people around the world so that the atrocities of the past could never happen again. And let there be no doubt: The United States has Israel's back.
We will make sure the Jewish and democratic State of Israel can defend itself today, tomorrow, as we always have. It's as simple as that.
These atrocities have been sickening.
We're with Israel. Let's make no mistake.
Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, what was your reaction——
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]
Q. Have you been briefed on the $6 billion, Mr. President?"""
"Oct 10, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-united-states-fire-administrators-summit-fire-prevention-and-control-0,Remarks to the United States Fire Administrator's Summit on Fire Prevention and Control,"""[The President addressed the summit, which was held at the National Emergency Training Center in Emmitsburg, MD, via videoconference.]
The President. Hello, hello, hello. Thank you, Dr. Lori, for that introduction. You and your team deserve tremendous credit for what you've accomplished over these last 2 years.
And a special hello to Eddie—Ed Kelly, my good friend. Ed, I can't see you out there, but I'm sure you're around. And also Kevin—and Chief Kevin Quinn as well.
Look, I joined this summit virtually last year, and I wanted to be with you in person this year. But there was a critical issue, and it required me to stay at the White House to respond to the terrorist attacks in Israel.
We've gotten word that several firefighters have already been killed in the assault on Israel, and Dr. Lori and her team are in touch with fire officials on the ground.
You know, you've heard me say before: God made man, then he made a few firefighters. [Laughter] And that's pretty close to the—the overwhelming human instinct is to run away from danger, and there's no more frightening danger than a fire. And when that bell rings, you run toward it. You put your gear on, you jump on the truck, and you do what you've got to do.
Because being a firefighter isn't just what you do, it's who you are.
But we also know your bravery comes at a real cost. This year alone, we've had—already had 61 line-of-duty firefighters' deaths in the United States. And I've had far too many firefighter funerals that I've attended in my life, from coast to coast.
This is a dangerous profession, and there's no getting around it. But there are things we can do to make the job a little bit safer. And that's what I want to talk about today.
With the effects of climate change becoming more severe, fire departments that never trained for wildfires—to fight wildfires are facing wildfires head on now.
And Jill and I just visited Maui in the wake of that historic fire there——
[At this point, the President wiped his nose with a handkerchief.]
Excuse me, I have a bit of a cold—and we met firefighters who performed breathtaking acts of heroism while their own homes stood at risk and some burned to the ground.
This is National Fire Prevention Week, and the one thing we can do to make our job—your jobs safer is to prevent the fires in the first place. So we launched a national initiative offering Federal grants to help local governments adopt the most up-to-date building codes to make structures more resilient to extreme weather events and—like wildfires and hurricanes. It makes a difference.
In January of last year, a fire tore through affordable housing units in Philadelphia, killing 12 people—many of whom were children—in large part because the smoke detectors didn't work. In the wake of this tragedy, I signed a bill that requires affordable housing units to have reliable, tamper-resistant smoke alarms.
Just 4 days after that Philadelphia fire I just referenced, another fire took place, costing 17 lives in Bronx—in the Bronx because the building made up of affordable housing units had no firesafe—none—it was not firesafe. Period.
In response, I signed legislation giving the U.S. Fire Administrator authority to conduct onsite fire safety investigations of major fires to determine what happened and prevent the needless heartbreak in the future.
Too many lives have been lost from fires that could have been prevented—the fires. And people of color, people with disabilities, seniors, low-income Americans are too often the victims. You know, my administration is going to combine—continue working to protect all Americans from these tragedies.
But also—we also know that what protects firefighters—the only thing that really protects firefighters is more firefighters. During the pandemic, we invested $350 billion from the American Rescue Plan that States and cities could use to keep firefighters on the job through premium pay, new fire and rescue vehicles, extra staff during peak times.
I also signed a budget providing $360 million [$260 million; White House correction] to both the Assistance to Fire Prevention—Firefighters Grant program and SAFER grant program for hundreds of emergency response vehicles, thousands of sets of turnaround—turnout gear, and critical cancer research and cancer screening. Look—and to put almost 1,200 more firefighters in the field. My budget this year includes another $370 million for each of these grants.
It's also past time to acknowledge the physical toll of these jobs. Toxic substances you've exposed to are almost certainly why cancer is the leading cause—the leading killer of firefighters is cancer.
You don't have to look any further than 9/11. We stepped up and we did something about that. We would step up now—we should step up now.
My budget includes $1.7 billion for my Cancer Moonshot—to keep part—key parts of my unity agenda in the State of the Union to cut cancer deaths rates in half, to invest in research and development and early detection and screening, and to end cancer, which we could do, as we know it.
We passed the PACT Act as part of my unity agenda to help veterans, like my son, exposed to toxic materials and their families recover and receive compensation. You know, around 20 percent of firefighters are military veterans.
You know, thanks to this law, the Department of Veterans Affairs has already provided free screening for over 4.5 million veterans from toxic exposure from burn pits. These burn pits, as you know, are the size of football fields. They're 8 to 10 feet deep. And they're used to incinerate—they're used to incinerate wastes of war: tires, poisonous chemicals, jet fuel, and so much more.
You know, we also just created the special claims unit at the Department of Labor to process cancer claims and all other claims of Federal firefighters and to process them faster.
You know, and we're tracking PFAS, the so-called forever chemical that for years have been in fire suppression agents and in your gear. I signed legislation to fund research aimed at understanding the risk you face from PFAS, and we banned the Department of Defense from buying gear, by the way, that contains PFAS as soon as an alternative is available.
In April, the CDC launched the National Firefighter Registry to collect details—detailed data to better understand the link between workforce exposure and cancer among firefighters.
I'm also proud to sign the Federal Firefighters Fairness Act, giving more than 10,000 firefighters and their families critical workers' compensation and other benefits by making sure certain kinds of heart problems, lung disease, and cancers are presumed to be caused by the job.
We also know the sacrifices you make are more than physical. According to one study, firefighters develop posttraumatic stress at a similar rate of troops returning from combat. And I don't know why that should surprise anybody. It's estimated that more than 100 firefighters a year die from—by suicide.
That's why I signed legislation extending the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program not only to firefighters who are permanently disabled, but to their families of firefighters who die after experiencing trauma like PSD [PTSD; White House correction] on duty.
But we also know we need to do more on the front end to help firefighters cope with the mental health challenges that come from the job.
You know, when it finally comes time for you to leave the job, you should be able to retire with dignity. That's why I was proud to sign legislation to make sure disability retirement benefits remain tax free. Let me say it again: Those retirement benefits remain tax free. I'm also going to protect your right to collective bargaining.
Let me close with this. When the worst happens, when those alarms go off, when everything and everyone you love is in danger, there's no better sight in the world than a firefighter ready to go to work. So thank you for being who you are.
I want to thank your families. Every time that alarm goes off and you respond, they wait for that phone call—pray God, they don't get that phone call. You sacrifice every day—they sacrifice every day along with you.
And thank you for all the heroes you represent—on alert, on call—in communities all across America at this very minute.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our firefighters.
You're the best. You've been with me my whole career. You've taught me a lot.
I want to know how many other people go out, risk their lives, and save someone in their home and then, a week later, standing on a corner with a boot, collecting money to help someone rebuild the home they just lost. You're the very best. You really are.
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

"Oct 11, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-roundtable-discussion-with-jewish-community-leaders,Remarks at a Roundtable Discussion With Jewish Community Leaders,"""The President. Please, everybody, sit down.
Second Gentleman Douglas C. Emhoff. Thank you. Please be seated. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you so much for joining us today. I want to start by just saying the Vice President and I are outraged at these horrific terrorist attacks in Israel perpetrated by Hamas. We are outraged. With our broken hearts, we are sending our love, our strength, and our unwavering support to the people of Israel.
I am honored to be with all of you today as an American, as a patriot who loves this country, but also as a Jew. And like all Jews, I feel a deep, visceral connection to Israel and its people.
We witnessed a mass murder of innocent civilians. It was a terrorist assault, and there is never any justification for terrorism. There are no two sides to this issue.
The images that we saw will be seared in our brains forever: rockets falling on cities, people dragged from their homes and shot dead, children sheltering from bullets, bodies lining the streets. And all the while, we see videos of these terrorists cheering on these atrocities.
The toll on Israel and the Jewish community is hard to imagine, but we can imagine it because it's happening. And I know many of you have sent texts and calls this weekend checking on loved ones. And I know too many of you received heartbreaking replies. And we know today that at least 22 Americans won't be coming home.
I know you're all hurting. The entire Jewish community is hurting. I'm hurting. We grieve with you. We stand with you.
But thank God we have the steady leadership of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris during this unthinkable time in our history. Their moral compass, their calm and empathy are what we need in this time of crisis. And we saw that yesterday when President Biden, with Vice President Harris and Secretary Blinken by his side, powerfully addressed the Nation and made clear to the world that Israel has the United States' unwavering support.
Our President and Vice President are making sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself. We are grateful for their leadership and support for Israel at this exceptionally difficult time.
We also acknowledge and address how these events will impact us as Jews, which is why we're here to have this discussion. And I know many of us feel a deep fear that these attacks will unfortunately and already have led to a rise in hate and anti-Semitism. We're already seeing it. And that's why this discussion and the work you and your organizations do is so vitally important.
Almost a year ago, I sat right in this spot in this very room, and many of you were here with me that day. And, then, we called attention to the epidemic of hate that we're facing. And following that meeting, we took action.
And in May, the Biden-Harris administration released the first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. The plan includes over 100 meaningful actions we are taking right now to fight back against anti-Semitism and hate. And each of you played a role in crafting this strategy. We couldn't have done this without you. So thank you for the work that you've done, that you're continuing to do.
And, as we're going to discuss later, myself and the Biden-Harris administration officials are working with Federal, State, and local leaders to implement this plan across the country. We are going to continue to bring people together, and importantly, we're going to build coalitions to fight back against hate.
We cannot do this alone. The story of the Jewish people has always been one of perseverance and resilience. In dark times, we come together and we fight back, and we also seek to build a better world.
Last year, before my trip to Poland and Germany, President Biden took me into the Oval Office. He told me how his father had taught him about the horrors of the Holocaust and how he later traveled to Dachau with his children and grandchildren to teach them those same lessons.
So I know firsthand how important it is to President Biden to preserve our Jewish history and to make sure that hate has no safe harbor in America and the world. As an American Jew, I am so grateful that, in this moment of tumult and pain, we have Joe Biden as President and Kamala Harris as Vice President.
It is now my honor to introduce a true advocate for the Jewish community. Please join me in welcoming President Joe Biden.
The President. Thank you. Please. Please.
Folks, I came, first of all, to say thank you. Thank you to all of you in this room. You not only care, but you've—you've been breaking your neck over the last couple years to deal with this overall issue of anti-Semitism.
Now, I know many of you are personally impacted by what's happened in Israel. There are thousands of dual citizens. Maybe some of your relatives are there.
And, Doug, I want to thank you for all the work you've done on behalf of our administration to combat anti-Semitism.
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
And I apologize. I've been on the phone around the clock with our friends around the world, quite frankly, discussing what's going on in Israel.
And I want you to know that—I want to thank you as well for—all of you as well for working—the work you're doing to bring comfort and—in this moment of grief, for those of you who are grieving as well.
And you'll read this weekend in synagogue, the Torah teaches us that God made the stars to, quote, ""Give light on the Earth . . . and separate light from darkness""—""give light on the Earth . . . and separate light from darkness.""
You know, it's been hard to find that light during the darkness of these past few days, when terrorist groups like Hamas brought not only terror, but sheer evil—sheer evil—to the world. Evil that echoes the worst and matches—in some cases, exceeds—the worst atrocities of ISIS. More than 1,000 civilians slaughtered in Israel.
And by the way, I've been speaking with a number of Israeli leaders, a number of leaders around the world, leaders in the region as well. And you know, among those who have been victimized—this evil, who would—who have been killed are at least 22 American citizens.
This attack was a campaign of pure cruelty—not just hate, but pure cruelty—against the Jewish people. And I would argue it's the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust—the deadliest day since the Holocaust, one of the worst chapters in human history that reminded us all that—that expression I learned from my dad early on: ""Silence is complicity.""
I'm not—I mean, silence is complicity. It really is. And I want you to know—I think you've already figured it out—I refuse to be silent, and I know you refuse to be silent as well.
And you all—I know you're here with my senior staff. You all represent a voice that America has to hear. America is not—can't be silent.
You know, we not only reject terrorism, but it goes beyond that. It goes beyond rejecting terrorism.
You know, I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu for—I don't know how many times this—but this—again this morning. And already we're surging additional military assistance to the Israeli Defense Force, including ammunition, interceptors to replenish the Iron Dome. And we have moved a U.S. carrier fleet to the Eastern Mediterranean, and we're sending more fighter jets there into that region and made it clear—made it clear—to the Iranians: ""Be careful.""
We want to make it real clear: We're working on every aspect of the hostage crisis in Israel, including deploying experts to advise and assist with recovery efforts.
Now, the press are going to shout to me—and many of you are—that, you know, ""What are you doing to bring these—get these folks home?"" If I told you, I wouldn't be able to get them home.
Folks, there's a lot we're doing—a lot we're doing. I have not given up hope on bringing these folks home. But the idea that I'm going to stand here before you and tell you what I'm doing is bizarre. So I hope you understand how bizarre I think it would be to try to answer that question.
In the days ahead, we're going to continue to work closely with our partners in Israel and around the world to ensure Israel has what it needs to defend its citizens, its cities, and to respond to these attacks.
As I said yesterday, my commitment to Israel's security and the safety of the Jewish people is unshakeable. The United States has Israel's back. And I have yours as well, both at home and abroad.
You know, you can see the pain in some your faces as I walked into this room. You okay, kiddo?
Well, your fear for family, friends back in Israel. You worry about kids being targeted in school about—about going about their daily lives. You're hurt by the downplaying of Hamas's atrocities and blaming Israel. This is unconscionable.
And I have asked members of my team, including Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas and Attorney General Garland, to work intensively with our Jewish community partners, so many of you here—to set up security around Jewish life in America, identify, prevent, and disrupt emerging threats that occur.
You know, we're also going to continue to condemn and combat anti-Semitism at every single turn—at every turn. You know, the past few days have been a solemn reminder that hate never goes away.
If you'll hold on a second, I used to—I used to think you could defeat hate, that you could make it—all it does is go underground. It just goes underground. It doesn't go away. It only hides until it's given a little oxygen—a little bit of oxygen.
And that's why I've secured the largest ever increase in funding for physical security for nonprofits—including synagogues, Jewish community centers, Jewish day schools—and in May, released the first-ever National Strategy To Counter Antisemitism with the input from many of you in this room. Many of you in this room helped write that.
It's the most ambitious, comprehensive effort to combat anti-Semitism in American history—in all of American history. And we're aggressively implementing it.
But—but—we must all do our part and forcefully speak out against anti-Semitism and push back against the attempts to deny or distort the facts. To make clear, there is no place for hate in America—not against Jews, not against Muslims, not against anybody.
And we mourn the act—an act that you and so many leaders have, across the country, been showing us what thousands of years of Jewish history has shown us: the enduring strength—and I mean this sincerely—the enduring strength and spirit of the Jewish community.
If you'll excuse a point of personal privilege—they used to say in the Senate—that's why I took my kids—every one, when they turned 14 years old, one at a time, I put them on a plane and took them to Dachau. I wanted them to see that you could not not know what was going on walking through those gates. You could not fail to understand as a country what was going on. And that's a fact.
It had a profound impact on my children and my grandchildren. Some thought taking a 14-year-old grandchild was a mistake, but I took them one at a time. I've got three more to go. And, folks, it's important.
You know, the miracle of Israel is Israel. It's Israel itself: the hope it inspires, the light it represents to the world.
And, folks, I was asked to—in one of my very frank conversations with Bibi and with Herzog. Said, ""Why do I feel so deeply about this?"" It's not about the region. I truly believe, were there no Israel, no Jew in the world would be ultimately safe. It's the only ultimate guarantee. The only ultimate guarantee. The only ultimate guarantee.
And, folks, because of you—and I mean this sincerely—because of you speaking up, because of the intensity and the intellect and the brilliance you bring to this cause, I think we have a chance to end this in a way that is—that makes it very difficult for it to be repeated.
I want to thank you for your leadership. And, as I said, there's a lot to talk about. And—but I'm really, quite frankly, concerned as to—it's hard to talk about this without detail. And it's contrary to our interests to let out the detail of what we're going on.
I mean, this is just around the clock, as you understand—you fully understand. But, you know, I've known Bibi for over 40 years in a very frank relationship. I know him well. And the one thing that I did say that it is really important that Israel, with all the anger and frustration and just—I don't know how to explain it—that exists is that they operate by the rules of war—the rules of war. And there are rules of war.
And I believe Israel is doing everything in its power to—to pull the country together, stay on the same page, and we're going to do everything in our power to make sure Israel succeeds and, God willing, to bring home those Americans who are in harm's way.
I'm going to let you all have the private conversation you've been having, which you should continue to have. But I just came to basically—I really mean it from the bottom of my heart; I give you my word as a Biden—thank you. Thank you for the intensity of your support. It matters. It matters that Americans see what's happening.
I mean, I've been doing this a long time. I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children. I never thought I'd ever—anyway. I——
But there are countries in the region that are trying to be of some help, including Arab nations that are trying to be of some help. So, anyway.
The President's Faith/Drawing Courage From Faith 
Participant. Mr. President, where do you draw strength and inspiration in these troubling times?
The President. From my faith. From my faith—my faith that—that at the core of every human being is a spark of humanity and decency, and it's got to be touched. It's got to be spoken to. That's what you do. That's why you're here.
It's not about, you know, revenge. It's about—it's about decency, just basically decent—just basic decency. Treating people with a sense of—I don't know quite how to say it. But I know we can overcome this. I know we can overcome this.
Look, I don't know anything about the kind of loss that's talking—but I know a little bit of what it's like to feel loss, lose people you adore, get a phone call saying they're gone. I get that part. Not the same, but I get that part.
And what I've learned is that as we persevere, we can grow. And the day will come when the memory of that person or those persons will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. It will happen. It will happen, but, God, it takes a long time sometimes.
And when it's borne out of something that has been anything from a mistake to a vicious, vicious intent, you know, it varies in degrees. I'm not saying I know the same, but I just—look, I mean, I'll never forget—well, I won't go into that.
Anyway, I just think that if we stay true to our values, pursue with every inch and every bit of our energy to get this right, we can bury this again and bring people back—bring people home and bring them together, I think we can—I think we can change the Middle East. But then again, I have been referred to as a congenital optimist.
And I'm not going to answer any questions from you guys right now, but my team here knows, when—when the press is gone, they'll talk more directly to you. But even then, they're not going to be able to tell you all that we're doing and all that's going on. So——
Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America Executive Director of Public Policy Nathan J. Diament. Not a question, sir, but we—may we please say thank you. Eighty years ago this week—eighty years ago this week, a group of 400 rabbis came to Washington hoping to meet with Franklin Delano Roosevelt and appeal to him to act to rescue the Jews who were being persecuted in Europe, and they were refused a meeting with President Roosevelt. They were refused entry to the White House.
And the fact that we are here today and you have spoken as the President of the United States so clearly in support of Israel, so clearly in support of the Jewish people, and so—and welcomed leaders and representatives of the Jewish community into the White House for this discussion shows what a dramatic distance we've traveled in these United States, how we as the Jewish community are blessed to live today in these United States. And we thank you for your leadership and your moral clarity.
The President. Thank you. Thank you."""
"Oct 13, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-philadelphia-pennsylvania-3,"Remarks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","""Hello, everybody.
It's good to be almost home. Hey, guys, I live in Delaware. Okay? [Laughter]
And by the way, I'm a big Pennsylvania guy, but you have an advantage in Philly. One, I married a Philly girl. Two, you're between Scranton and Wilmington. You know, Scranton—you guys have no sense of humor, man. [Laughter]
Look, Ryan, thanks for that introduction. I really mean it.
Shooting of Police Officers at Philadelphia International Airport 
And before I get started, I want to acknowledge two brave police officers—on a serious note—who were shot last night, one was killed, at the Philadelphia Airport. I talked to the chief and the mayor about this. They put their lives on the line to protect this community. We owe them a debt of gratitude, and we're praying for them and for their families today.
Hamas Attacks Against Israel 
I also want to say a word about the situation in Israel. The more we've learned about the attack, the more horrifying it becomes. More than 1,000—1,000—innocent lives lost, including at least 27 Americans. These guys make—they make Al Qaida look pure. They're pure evil.
As I said from the beginning: The United States—make no mistake about it—stands with Israel. The United States stands with Israel. Secretary of State Blinken was in Israel yesterday, and Secretary of Defense Austin is there today. We're making sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself and to respond to these attacks.
It's also a priority for me to urgently address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. At my direction, our teams are working in the region, including communicating directly with the governments of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab nations and the United Nations to surge support and humanitarian consequences for Hamas's attack to help Israel.
You know, we have to—we can't lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and Hamas's appalling attacks, and they're suffering as a result as well.
This morning I spoke with the family members of all those Americans who are still unaccounted for on a Zoom call for about an hour and a—10, 15 minutes. They're going through agony not knowing what the status of their sons, daughters, husbands, wives, children are. You know, it's gut wrenching. I assured them of my personal commitment to do everything possible—everything possible—to return every missing American to their families.
We're working round the clock to secure the release of Americans held by Hamas in close cooperation with Israel and our partners around the region. And we're not going to stop until we bring them home.
National Economy and Clean Energy 
Folks, now for the reason to be here.
Secretary Granholm, no one is more enthusiastic about building our clean energy future than you are.
And we also—I've—I've got so many friends here today. The Pennsylvania delegation. Josh Shapiro, the Governor. Mayor Kenney is an old friend. One of my closest friends in the Senate and in politics, Bobby Casey. Representative Brendan Boyle, who's always there.
And I have Governor John Carney from Delaware and Tom Carper, two of the best people I've ever worked with.
And New Jersey delegation—Donald Norcross. I kid Donald all the time that Delaware is small, but we own the Delaware River up to the high-water mark in New Jersey. [Laughter] By the way, there was a lawsuit that happened—actually happened. Anyway, but—and he couldn't be here, but Cory Booker is a good friend, and he's—was—who's on the ground in Israel and—when the attacks occurred. For everything he's doing to support the people of Israel, and I also want to thank him for pushing so hard for the projects we're about to talk about.
And Governor Phil Murphy couldn't be here, either, but he's also a strong, strong supporter.
And one thing before we get started: Let's go, Phillies! You watch that game last night? Yo! Between the Phillies and Eagles, man, we're—it's a good year, man. [Laughter] This is a good year. We're going to win the Series and the NFL. Look—and if I didn't say that, Bobby Brady would be up on the stage here with me. [Laughter]
Look, you've heard me say it before: When I think climate, I think jobs—good-paying jobs, union jobs. That's a—by the way, I'm serious.
Look, let me get one thing straight about unions. The reason I'm so pro-union: The middle class built America. Wall Street did not build the middle class. Unions built the middle class. That's why. I mean it. I'm not—that's not a joke. I'm deadly earnest about that.
And it's especially true when it comes to clean energy and manufacturing. When the public sector and the private sector come together, proving we can do big things in America.
One of the things that I worried about was that, you know, we talked about—people—there used to be an argument that you can't have industrial policy dictated by the Government.
Well, guess what? I found that when you—when the Government invests in the needs of the American people, invests in America and the American people, guess what? The private sector jumps on real quick.
In fact, I've asked CEOs this question repeatedly: When the United States invests considerable resources in new industry, does it encourage or discourage businesses to get in? And the answer is clear. It encourages them to get in.
Federal investments attract private-sector investments. A lot of it. It creates jobs and industries, like clean energy, and demonstrates we're all in this together. And that's what this is all about today.
I'm here to announce one of the largest advanced manufacturing investments in the history of this Nation: $7 billion in Federal investments that's going to attract $40 billion in private investment in clean hydrogen to power our economy spread over 16 States, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, many of them union jobs—most union jobs. It's a $50 billion investment in our economic competitiveness, in a stronger energy-secure economy, and combating the existent threat of climate change.
It's all part of my plan to make things in America. You know, there was a law early on that I even didn't—I forgot about, which was that—back in the thirties, during the Roosevelt time, it said it wasn't only good, but we should encourage—when the President has money to spend that the Congress gave him, that President should do two things.
One, is make sure he or she invests that money by making sure that it's—that money is being spent on American projects, by American workers, with American products. And guess what? Presidents all along kept saying: ""Well, we have exceptions. We—only 30 percent need to be that. Only 40 percent.""
Well, guess what? I changed that. To invest in America and invest in Americans is what we do. We grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
When I came to office, I was determined to move away from the trickle-down economics. You know, as they usually say: When the wealthy did well and big business, everybody is going to do well? Well, not a whole hell of a lot dropped down on my dad's kitchen table when I was growing up. [Laughter] No, I'm serous.
We have to—I decided we're going to focus on building the middle class. When the middle class does well, everybody does well. The poor have a way up, the middle class do very well, and the wealthy still do well. They've got to start paying their taxes. That's another issue.
Folks, you know, the press started calling this—my plan—""Bidenomics."" Today's announcement is a critical piece of that plan.
Let me explain. I've made it a goal for our country to get to net-zero emissions from pollutants no later than 2050. By the way, it's the only existential threat to humanity, is, we don't do this, if we don't stay below these numbers, our—the whole world is changing. Our kids are going to be and our grandkids are going to be—anyway, I don't want to even think about it.
Clean hydrogen is going to help us meet this goal. When it comes to charging our cars or powering our homes, all we need is clean electricity to power—to get the—from solar and wind. That's just fine. And we're doing that. And we're getting close to meeting that goal.
But when it comes to manufacturing things like steel, aluminum, and other materials, factories need to process materials at over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit to get that done. You can't—you need to burn fuel to get that done. You can't get it done with wind and solar power. You cannot generate that much energy.
That's where hydrogen comes in. Hydrogen, you can power industries like the production of steel and aluminum. It can transfer—and it's going to end up changing our transportation system, like trucks, rail, planes.
Clean hydrogen produce the use—energy resources like wind and solar. That lets us get to—you get to this place without putting more carbon in the atmosphere.
You know, I—when I put that forward, they said we couldn't do anything bipartisanly in the Congress. Well, I introduced the bipartisan infrastructure bill. It got passed. It got passed even though we only had a couple votes extra in the Senate. And it contained funding to harness the benefits of hydrogen and to encourage States and industries to join together to create things called ""hydrogen hubs.""
And, folks, those hubs are about people coming together across State lines, across industries, across political parties to build a stronger, more sustainable economy and to rebuild our communities.
The hubs in the Middle Atlantic Region is made up of 17 sites spanning Southeastern Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey. And the hubs are existing infrastructure supporting the oil industry and oil pipelines and refineries, and repurpose and regenerate—generate, store, transport, and use clean hydrogen instead. This hub alone is going to produce 100,000 tons of hydrogen per year—100,000 tons.
Up to $750 million in public investment is attracting $2.25 billion in private investment. And here are some of the examples of how it's going to work. The Delaware City Refinery in my State—vacant—owned by Chesapeake Utilities in Georgetown, Delaware, and a former jet fuel terminal in New Jersey all use renewable energy, like solar power, to produce clean hydrogen.
Plumbers, pipefitters are going to replace and retrofit oil pipelines to transport the hydrogen here, where fueling stations at the Port of Philadelphia, in partnership with Philadelphia Gas Works, will provide clean hydrogen to people to power trucks, heavy-duty equipment operated by longshoremen and teamsters. That will mean cleaner air, since the equipment that runs on hydrogen produces fewer emissions than diesel.
Across town, on the site of the old Philadelphia Energy Solutions Oil Refinery, a new Bellwether District, Hilco—well, it's going to use clean hydrogen or steam to power generate—to power the life sciences and logistics on campuses where companies will do research and development for the next-generation technologies.
The city of Philadelphia and Southern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority are going to use clean hydrogen to power their heavy-duty vehicle fleets, like steel—like street sweepers, garbage trucks, fuel cells, and electronic buses.
The DuPont Company in Delaware is going to use hydrogen to power their research and development operations at one of the most extensive power—experimental stations in the world in Wilmington, Delaware.
Here, in the Mid-Atlantic hub, every single one of these projects will use project labor agreements. That's another way of saying ""union."" Union. And by the way, here, it's going to create 20,800 jobs—20,800 jobs—here in this hub: plumbers, pipefitters, electricians, laborers, and so much more.
Look, we're not just creating jobs here in the region. In Western Pennsylvania, in Ohio, West Virginia, a hydrogen hub will bring another source of good-paying jobs to the coal communities so workers who have powered our Nation for generations can now work and produce clean hydrogen, just like—just like we've seen them start their careers reclaiming abandoned mines, manufacturing advanced batteries, and the solar industry. Because they deserve it. They powered us for so long, just like my hometown of Scranton.
The same communities that were once thriving coal-mining and power plant towns will now be at the center of our clean energy economy. We're restoring hope and opportunity and dignity along the way. That was my commitment, and that's what we're delivering.
We're doing the same thing at the hub in the Midwest, a hub in California, and another hub in the Dakotas and Minnesota. All across the country, from coast to coast, in the Heartland, we're building a clean energy future here in America, not somewhere else.
Taken together, the emission reductions from these hydrogen hubs will be the equivalent of taking 5.5 million gas-powered vehicles off the road—5.5 million.
And across America, all these hubs are anchored in the promise to local communities: a promise to build these right, to ensure local priorities are at the forefront, risks are mitigated, and everyone benefits, especially communities left behind, like those that have suffered disproportionately from the legacy of pollution and environmental injustice.
For example, here in Pennsylvania, Cheney University—the oldest HBCU in the country—is part of this hub and will be training workers for these new clean energy jobs.
Hubs are just one example of what we're doing to rebuild America for all Americans. Through the bipartisan infrastructure law, which I helped write and pass, we're making the most substantial investment since President Eisenhower in roads, bridges, ports, airports, clean water, high-speed internet. These are good-paying jobs.
We've already announced over 38,000 projects across 4,500 communities all across this Nation. Here in Pennsylvania, we've already announced—it's going to get $10.2 billion, including for 300 specific projects across the State.
There's no better example—[applause ]. There's no better example of how we're—how we're rebuilding America and doing big things right here in Philly, where union labor—a great team effort to get I-95 back up and running in just 12 days, with the help of the Governor, after a section of that highway collapsed. Anybody think we'd be able to do that in 12 days? It had never been done before.
We're upgrading the airports, from Pittsburgh to Lehigh Valley to right here in Philly. And I want to tell you—and, Bobby—I say ""Bobby""—my good buddy, the guy from Scranton—you know?—Casey. We're investing $900 million—almost a billion bucks—to rebuild the Montgomery Locks and Dam.
We're going to get moving on the—and I promised Bob. We've got a lot of money for Amtrak. We're going to build—where is he? Bobby, we're going to build that line from Scranton to New York. It's coming, man. I'm determined to build that line. We used to have it. Now we've got the money, we're going to get it done.
Since I took office, we've created 13.9 million new jobs across America—13.9. We've created 850,000 [815,000; White House correction] manufacturing jobs, twice as many as the previous administration created in all its time.
The unemployment rate has stayed below 4 percent for 20 straight months in a row, the longest stretch in 50 years. We've achieved a 70-year low in unemployment rate for women. We've seen record-low employment—unemployment for African American and Hispanic workers and people with disabilities. This is everybody. Not just a few people; this is everybody.
And by the way, this data shows we have the highest—highest—share of working-age Americans in the workforce in 20 years.
And inflation is coming down. It's down 60 percent since last summer. Core inflation is the lowest level in 2 years, and now we have the lowest inflation rate of any G-7—any major industrial country in the world.
We're creating good jobs in communities—we have more to do. But we're creating good jobs in communities across the country, including in places that have been left behind for too long because factories shut down, towns were hollowed out, and jobs were moved, and people lost their sense of pride.
Hold a second. Think about it. How many small towns you know in Pennsylvania and all across the Midwest where there was a factory that for 30, 40 years people were able to work and have a good, decent salary—could live a middle class life? And, all of a sudden, corporate America decided: ""I'm going to find cheaper labor overseas. I'm going to send the job overseas and import the product.""
Not anymore. When those jobs move overseas, we're—they're bringing them back, and we're bringing them back big time—big time.
And by the way, I mean it. Think of the pride. You know, you lived in a neighborhood. You lived in a small town. Your whole life, your father and your grandfather—you're able to make it. And, all of a sudden, there's nothing left. Kid comes to you and says: ""I got a good education, Mom, but I can't live here anymore. There's no jobs."" We're going to restore their pride as well.
Under Bidenomics, you don't have to leave home or your family to get a good job. Under Bidenomics, we're investing in industries of the future so that the future is made in America—made in America. And, folks, we're just getting started.
My ""Investing in America"" agenda has led to manufacturing boom, attracting over a half a trillion dollars—half a trillion dollars—in private investment in 2½ years, in manufacturing and the industries of the future.
Spending on factory construction has doubled in the last 2 years after growing only 2 percent under my predecessor. And now, instead of exporting American jobs, we're creating American jobs and exporting American products. I really mean it. Think about—I know this sounds boring—but I really mean it. And that's good for everybody.
Let me close with this. I came to office determined to get this country up again so it—we could face the existential threat of climate and still grow, to fundamentally change our economy, and to transition this country to a clean energy future. Today's announcement is all part of a bigger vision to do just that.
We're going to invest—in the Inflation Reduction Act that we passed, I was able to put in six—$369 billion—$369 billion. And by the way, I reduced the budget by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction]. [Laughter] Okay? I reduced the debt while doing this. To fight climate change, it's the largest investment of its kind anywhere in the world—the single largest investment ever.
And we invented—by the way, we invented the semiconductor, the little thing—that little chip about the size of the end of your finger—when we went to the Moon. It affects nearly everything in our lives, whether you have a cell phone, an automobile, a refrigerator, sophisticated weapons systems.
But guess what? We were initially producing 40 percent of them all in the world. Guess what? We got down to producing 10 percent. Why? We took it overseas.
So I proposed legislation—which I thought would be a slam dunk to pass, but we had a little bit of resistance from my MAGA friends—and signed it. And as a result, semiconductor companies all over the world are investing hundreds of billions of dollars to bring chip production back home.
For example, you know, just outside of Ohio—outside of Columbus, Ohio, there was a thousand acres. We had Intel come along and say: ""Look, we're going to invest there. We're going to invest over $20 billion. We're going to build these new fabs""—these factories, they call them. They're, like, twice the size of football fields. And guess what the average pay is? About 100- to 110,000 bucks a year. And you don't need a college degree to have the job. [Laughter]
Look, with this bipartisan infrastructure law, we're seeing cranes in the air, shovels in the ground, and pride coming back to cities and towns all across the country.
Nearly a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt's Rural Electrification Act brought electricity to millions of Americans, generating significant economic growth and prosperity. Nearly 70 years ago, President Eisenhower launched the Interstate Highway System.
The investment we're making today will be for our kids and grandkids what those historic projects were in previous generations, only bigger. Today—today's announcement is transformational. You know, and it joins a long line of transformational investments we've made just since I took office.
And as a result, I truly believe that this country is about to take off. Because for the first time in a long time, we're actually investing in America. We're investing in Americans, not just America. We're investing in our future.
I can honestly say—and I mean this—and I know I don't look it, but I've been around for a while—[laughter]—I've never been more optimistic about America's future.
We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. Nothing. Because of you all, we're going to get it done. We're the leading country in the world. We're going to remain that way.
And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you.""	Remarks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"
"Oct 14, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-human-rights-campaign-national-dinner,Remarks at the Human Rights Campaign National Dinner,"""The First Lady. Hello! Hi, everybody. Hi. Thank you. Thank you. Please. [Laughter] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Please. [Laughter] Please. Thank you.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The First Lady. Thank you. Thanks.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The First Lady. Really, thank you. Please.
Well, I can certainly say we feel the love from you. Thank you. And thank you, Kelley, for that introduction. You are a trailblazer, and HRC is so lucky to have you.
So how is everyone tonight? Look at you. Such beauty and boldness. I'm so proud that this community has made DC such a thriving, welcoming home to LGBTQ+ people. It's a remarkable departure from where we had been, when DC was a place where outing was used as a political weapon. Tonight we can celebrate without fear or shame.
But despite the freedom and acceptance we have fought for in places like DC, we know that in too many other parts of our country, these rights and freedoms are under attack.
Across the country, in places like Texas and Florida and Alabama, LGBTQ individuals don't have the freedom to be honest with their family or embrace their gender identity at work. They don't have the freedom to walk down the halls of their school as their authentic self. They don't have the freedom to hold hands with their partner on the sidewalk.
So, while we celebrate this beautiful community tonight, let's also remember how lucky we are and harden our resolve to advocate for those who are not.
We look forward to a time when all people in all places can feel the freedom and the joy that we feel here tonight. But until then, we fight. We fight for the trans individuals who are being bullied and killed. We fight for the LGBTQ kids who are forced into conversion therapy. We fight for the communities around the world while—where being gay is punishable by death.
Joe and I stand firmly and proudly with you in these fights, and we will be with you every step of the way.
There's nobody that I'd rather have in my corner than my husband, Joe Biden. Joe has always been a fierce advocate for this community, and I am so proud of all the work that he has done for the LGBTQ+ individuals here in the U.S. and around the globe.
And I am so honored to introduce him tonight. So please welcome the President of the United States, Joe Biden.
The President. Hello, hello, hello! My name's Joe Biden. I'm Jill's husband. [Laughter]
Folks, let me begin with a sincere thank-you. Please have a seat.
Audience members. We love you, Joe!
The President. Well, thank you.
But I hope you understand that you are the beacon of light around the world—not a joke. Whether I was in India or wherever I am, the LBGQ community comes up to me and says, ""Can you help?"" Not a joke. Not a joke. ""Can you help?"" You've given people so much hope.
It's all about hope. Think about it. How do you live without hope? And this community in the United States of America is leading the world in giving people hope.
Folks, my first thing I want to say tonight: Thank you. Thank you for changing lives around the world. You're doing it. You really are.
And for some of you who are closer to my age, it wasn't easy to do. [Laughter] No, I'm not joking. You'd lose your job. You'd get beat up. You got—a whole different circumstance.
Audience member. Thank you for being here with us!
The President. Well, I tell you what, I've been here every time you've invited me, because—careful, I'm like a poor relative. I show up when I'm invited. [Laughter]
Look, Kelley Robinson, thank you. Thank you for the introduction and for your leadership.
And congratulations to tonight's awardees. Shonda Rhimes, unstoppable creative force. Lena Waithe, I tell you what, a pathbreaking storyteller. And Matt Bomer, an actor who inspires. And you do inspire, Matt.
And Grayson, Libby, Hobbes, and Daniel, courageous young activists who lift our hopes up for the future. Earlier this year, they were kind of—I was—you were kind enough to invite Jill and me to the Trans Youth Prom. We couldn't make it, but it sounds like you had a hell of a lot of fun.
But you know, these young honorees joined us in June for the largest Pride Month celebration ever, ever held at the White House. And there's going to be more—at the White House. LGBTQ youth are among the bravest people I know, and you four are no exception.
Folks, this is the fourth time I've joined this dinner, coming back to my days as Vice President. At this pivotal moment in our history, Jill and I have come here tonight to say thank you for your courage, thank you for your hope, and thank you for your pride. Thank you for defending equal rights and dignity of all people, despite intense opposition and hate-fueled rhetoric, even violence, to try to keep you from moving.
You inspire us. And I want you all—the LGBTQ Americans—to know the Biden-Harris administration has your back——
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. I don't know who's hollering down there, but I can't hear you. [Laughter]
But look——
Audience member. Let Gaza live! Cease-fire now! Let Gaza live! Cease-fire now!
The President. I can't hear her. What's she saying? Well, thank you. Whatever you're saying. I'm going to say thank—I can't hear you. [Laughter]
Look, I've been labeled the most—[applause].
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Oh, I get it. Okay. [Laughter] I'm not sure that's a good thing. No, I'm only joking. [Laughter]
Look, I've been labeled the most pro-equality President in history. I'm not sure if that's true, but I tell you what: I'm grateful to lead an administration with more out-and-proud staff members at every level than every previous administration combined. All combined.
Together with all of you, my administration is defending, advancing equal human rights of the LGBTQ community all across the country—and I mean it—and around the world. I'm proud of our record. I signed the historic Executive orders strengthening civil rights protections in housing, employment, health care, education, the justice system.
As Commander in Chief, I ended the ban on transgender Americans serving in the military. As I pointed out, they can shoot as straight as anybody else I know. And on the anniversary of the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the Department of Defense announced a review of the records of LGBTQ servicemembers who had been discharged for ""less than honorable service."" That's going to make it easier for these veterans to finally access the benefits they earned through their service.
We launched an ambitious plan to end HIV epidemic by 2030, proposed new national PrEP program to prevent the spread of HIV, and we finally did away with the outdated policy banning gay and bisexuals from donating blood. We're leading with science, not stigma.
We've made human rights for LGBT around the world a top priority in my foreign policy: increasing our assistance to brave activists on the ground; defending human rights in countries to pass antigay laws—that passed antigay laws, like Uganda—going after Uganda, making clear that they cannot get the same benefit as other countries—and achieving tangible progress in—[inaudible].
Look, folks, here's the deal: Together, we're standing up for families. Some of you were with us on the South Lawn last December when I signed the Respect for Marriage Act, a law protecting the marriage of gay and interracial couples.
As I said in a TV interview more than a decade ago, marriage is a simple proposition. Who do you love? And will you be loyal to the person you love?
I was raised that that was quite a simple proposition. I've told this story before, but I'll tell it again. I was raised by a man who was a really decent, honorable man. I remember he was dropping me off. I wanted to be a—I wanted to work in the projects as a lifeguard on the east side of Wilmington. And he was dropping me off on his way to work at the City Hall to go get an application to be a lifeguard there.
And as I got out of the car at the four corners at the center of town, two men—it turns out, one going to the Brandywine—one was a—worked for the Dupont Company; the other worked for Hercules Company. This was back when I was a kid. And they leaned up and kissed one another. And I'd never seen that before.
And I turned and looked at my dad. And he just looked at me and said: ""Joey, it's simple. It's simple, Joey. They love one another. It's a simple proposition."" I mean it.
To everyone who helped make the Respect for Marriage Act a reality: Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
And together, we're standing up for children. As you know better than anyone, there are young people all across America sitting in their bedrooms at night scrolling through social media and staring at the ceiling wondering will they ever be loved, what happens if they tell their parents, what's going to go on. You've been through—many of you have been through it. Will they be ever accepted by their families, ever be free to be themselves, or if they should even be there or here on Earth.
Nearly every day, I get letters, literally, from children and parents terrified by what they're—what's happening all across America.
A 13-year-old transgender child wrote to me and said: ""I hate looking at the news, not because I'm a teenager and it's boring, but because it's painful. I hear adults much older than me debate about my existence when they don't even know me.""
Our message to young people across America must be unequivocal: You're loved, you're heard, and you're understood, and you belong. I mean it. And we see who you are, made in the image of God, deserving dignity, respect, and support.
That's why my administration, in combating the dangerous, cruel practice of conversion therapy, has been so outspoken. That's why we launched a nationwide crisis hotline where HB—LGBTQ youth who are feeling isolated and overwhelmed can get help. They just have to call 9-8-8 and talk to a counselor; 9-8-8 to talk to a counselor.
And this year, we're committing even more resources: new Federal action to address LGBTQ youth homelessness, new steps to protect kids in foster care. All of it matters.
But, for all the progress we've made, we know the barriers, the bias, the bigotry still exists. Perhaps because of the progress we've made, people want to push us back and pull us back.
Over 600—600—hateful laws introduced across the country, more than 70 of them becoming law just this last year, denying the existence of transgender people, silencing teachers, banning books, threatening parents with prison for getting their children health care.
Families across the country now face excruciating decisions to move to a different State to protect their child from dangerous anti-LGBTQ laws. I received a letter from one mom who wrote me, quote, ""I despair for families like mine who have already become refugees inside our Nation."" Refugees inside our Nation? That's how she feels, like a refugee inside our Nation. This is the United States of America.
In the United States Congress, extreme MAGA Republicans are trying to undo virtually every bit of progress we've made. They're trying to wipe out Federal funding to end the HIV epidemic, strip funding from community centers for seniors, reinstate the ban on transgender troops, ban the Department of Justice from enforcing civil rights laws, ban Pride flags from flying on public lands.
Who the hell—oh. [Laughter] Not very Presidential.
And they threaten the legal recognition of same-sex marriage.
And these are just the cruel attacks on the LGBTQ community. They're attacks on the foundations of our democracy. You know, they take aim at our fundamental values and principles, like the right to free expression, the right to make your own health care decisions, the right to raise our own children.
I'm never going to stand by and watch families terrorized, doctors and nurses criminalized, or any child targeted who—for who they are. It's who they are.
Jill and I, Kamala and Doug, and our entire administration will always stand with you against hate. And together, we're going to make even more progress.
You've heard me say it before, and I apologize having to repeat it: When a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay in the afternoon, something is still fundamentally wrong in this country. And that still exists.
That's why we must pass the Equality Act and pass it now. That's why we must do this.
At a time when studies show violence against LGBTQ Americans is on the rise, we have to do more to keep people in the community safe. Twenty-five years ago this week, Matthew Shepard was brutally taken from us. His courageous parents Judy and Dennis have turned his murder into a movement.
As we remember him, we also remember the LGBTQ people and allies killed this year. Like O'Shae Sibley, killed while dancing and expressing joy. Laura Ann Carleton, who simply hung a Pride flag outside her home—think of that—she hung a Pride flag outside her home. She was killed. Colin Smith, stabbed while defending a friend being harassed. And dozens of transgender Americans, especially transgender women of color, killed every year.
The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice and Health and Human Services has launched a safety partnership to better protect festivals and marches and community centers and businesses, to better protect health care providers serving the community, and to help folks report hate crimes.
Nearly a year after the horrific shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs, we have to fully implement the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years and then pass again the assault weapons ban, which Dianne and I passed. No excuse.
Who, in God's name, needs a weapon with a hundred rounds in their chamber? And the weapon's only meant for one thing: to kill people. We did it before. We can do it again. As long as I'm in office, I'm not going to stop until we get it done again.
Look, folks, let me close with this. A week ago, we saw hate manifest in another way in the worst massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust. More than 1,300 innocents—lives lost in Israel, including at least 27 Americans.
Children and grandparents alike kidnapped, held hostage by Hamas. A humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Innocent Palestinian families—and the vast majority of them have nothing to do with Hamas—they're being used as human shields.
Yesterday I spoke for over an hour with the family members of those Americans who are still unaccounted for on a Zoom call. They've endured an agony of not knowing what's happened.
Not the same thing, but I can tell you what it's like. It's one thing to lose someone who you know you're going to lose and be there with them and hold their hands, like I was able to do with my son. It's a very other thing to get a phone call, like I got years ago, saying: ""There's been an accident. Your wife and daughter are dead. I'm not sure your boys are going to make it."" The uncertainty of those 2 or 3 hours, trying to get back to find out. It's the worst feeling in the world. It's gut-wrenching.
And it's yet another reminder that hate never goes away. It only hides. It hides under the rocks. I thought, being so deeply involved in the civil rights movement, when I was able to convince, of all people, Strom Thurmond to vote for the Voting Rights Act in his last year—changed his mind—I thought, ""Well, you can defeat hate.""
But guess what happened? Hate just hides under the rocks until there's a little oxygen blown under, like happened—what happened in Charlottesville. Just a little bit. And then it comes roaring out again.
Folks, we have to reject hate in every form. Because history has taught us again and again anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia—they're all connected. Hate toward one group, left unanswered, opens the door for more hate toward more groups, more often, readily.
But here's what—which history shows: The antidote to hate is love. The answer to twisted, dehumanizing ideologies is solidarity and standing up for everyone's humanity.
That's why the laws that actually protect equality matter to every single American no matter who you are, who you love, or where you come from. This shouldn't be about conservative or liberal, red or blue. It should be about realizing the promise of the Declaration of Independence—it sounds corny—but a promise rooted in the sacred and the secular that all people are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Folks, it may sound corny, but we've never fully lived up to that promise, but we've never walked away from it like many want us to do. And we're not going to walk away for it on my watch, I promise you.
And all of you here tonight and all the advocates and allies across the country, I see the light that's going to triumph over the darkness. I see the hope that's going to conquer fear. I see the love that's going to overcome hate in all its forms.
I see a great nation because we're basically a good people. We just have to remember who we are. And we're not the victim. And although we are good folks, we've got to stand up and holler. We've got to stand up and holler. You cannot be silent. Silence is complicity. Silence is complicity.
Folks, we're the United States of America. And there is nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. Nothing, nothing, nothing. So let's stand together and get everyone else on the deal.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.""	Remarks at the Human Rights Campaign National Dinner"
"Oct 15, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-scott-pelley-cbs-news-60-minutes-0,"Interview with Scott Pelley of CBS News ""60 Minutes""","""THE PRESIDENT: I'm saying we're gonna do everything in our power to find those who are still alive and set them free. Everything in our power. And-- I'm not gonna go into the detail of that, but there's-- we're workin' like hell on it.
PELLEY: Why do you feel so strongly about speaking to these families personally on Zoom?
THE PRESIDENT: Because I think they have to know that the president of the United States of America cares deeply about what's happening. Deeply. We have to communicate to the world this is critical. this is not even hum-- human behavior. It's-- it-- it-- it's-- it's-- it's pure barbarism. And we're gonna do everything in our power to get them home if we can find them.
PELLEY: Is getting the American hostages back safely among your highest priorities now?
THE PRESIDENT: Of course, it is. But it's hard to-- hard to make distinctions. It's-- most important thing is ending this brutality and to hold those who committed it accountable.
PELLEY: Can you foresee U.S. troops in combat in this new Middle East war?
THE PRESIDENT: I-- I don't think that's necessary. Israel has one of the finest fighting forces in the country. I guarantee we're gonna provide them everything they need.
PELLEY: Because of what we're seeing in the Middle East, is the threat of terrorism in the United States increased?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes. I had a meeting this morning with the Homeland Security people, with the FBI, with-- for the Situation Room, for the better part of an hour to discuss how we make sure that we prevent a lone wolf and/or any cohi-- coordinated effort to try to do what was done in synagogues before, do what was done to Jews in the street. we're making a major effort to make sure that doesn't happen.
PELLEY: Certainly, about 1,200 Israeli civilians were killed in the initial attack, but now Hamas fighters and Palestinian civilians are being killed in the counterattack. Is it time for a ceasefire?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, there's a fundamental difference. Israel is going after a group of people who have engaged in barbarism that is as consequential as the Holocaust. And-- so I think Israel has to respond. They have to go after Hamas. Hamas is a bunch of cowards. They're hiding behind the civilians. They put their of—their—their—their headquarters where civilians are and buildings and the like. But to the extent they can separate out and avoi—I'm conf-- the Israelis are gonna do everything in their power to avoid the killing of innocent civilians.
Hamas is an Islamist terrorist group and the government of Gaza. Gaza is 25 miles long and averages 5 miles wide. Israel severely limits its economy so most Gazans are destitute. Now, Israel has cut off food, fuel, electricity and most water, and has ordered 1 million Gazans to evacuate to the southern half of Gaza. The U.N. warns of a humanitarian disaster.
PELLEY: There are about 2 million people in Gaza, as you know, Mr. President, 2 million people trapped. About half of them are children. Are you asking Israel to establish a humanitarian corridor in that area or get humanitarian supplies into it?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes, our team is talkin' to 'em about that. And-- whether there could be a safe zone. We're also talking to Egyptians-- whether there is an outlet to get these children and-- and women out--- into---out of that a that area at this moment. But it's-- it's c-- hard.
PELLEY: You would like to see a humanitarian corridor that allows some of the 2 million Gazans out of the area?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
PELLEY: You would like to see humanitarian supplies brought into Gaza?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
PELLEY: So you do not agree with the Israeli total siege of the Gaza Strip?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm confident that Israel is going to act under the measure-- the-- the rules of war. There-- there's-- standards that democratic institutions and countries w-- go-- go by. And so-- I'm-- I-- I'm confident that there's gonna be an ability for the innocents in Gaza to be able to have access to medicine and food and water. 
PELLEY: Would you support Israeli occupation of Gaza at this point?
THE PRESIDENT: I think it'd be a big mistake. Look, what happened in Gaza, in my view, is Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don't represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that...It would be a mistake to...for Israel to occupy...Gaza again. We...but going in but taking out the extremists the Hezbollah is up north but Hamas down south. Is a necessary requirement.
PELLEY: Do you believe that Hamas must be eliminated entirely?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I do. But there needs to be a Palestinian authority. There needs to be a path to a Palestinian state.
That path, called ""the two state solution,"" has been U.S. policy for decades. It would create an independent nation next to Israel for 5 million Palestinians who live in Gaza and on the West Bank of the Jordan River. 
PELLEY: And you believe Israel would pursue that after what's occurred--
THE PRESIDENT: Not now. Not now. Not now, but-- but I think Israel understands that a significant portion of Palestinian people do not share the views of Hamas and Hezbollah.
Hezbollah is a powerful Islamist militia to Israel's north which is armed and trained by Iran. Iran also supports Hamas. 
PELLEY: There's limited fighting already on the northern Israeli border, and I wonder what is your message to Hezbollah and its backer, Iran?
THE PRESIDENT: Don't. Don't, don't, don't.
PELLEY: Don't come across the border? Don't escalate this war?
THE PRESIDENT: That's right.
PELLEY: Is Iran behind the Gaza war?
President Biden: I don't wanna get into classified information. But to be very blunt with you, there is no clear evidence of that.
PELLEY: At this point, no evidence that Iran is behind any of this?
THE PRESIDENT: Correct. Now, Iran constantly supports Hamas and Hezbollah. I don't mean that. But in terms of were they-- w-- did they have foreknowledge; did they help plan the attack-- the-- there's-- there's no evidence of that at this point.
The president is asking for billions of dollars for Israel and Ukraine. But Congress is paralyzed. Hard-right Republicans are obstructing the election of a speaker of the house.
PELLEY: Does the dysfunction that we've seen in Congress increase the danger in the world?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Look, this is not your father's Republican Party. Thirty percent of it's made up of these MAGA Republicans who are maybe-- democracy is something I don't-- they don't look at the same way you and I look at democracy.
PELLEY: Are the wars in Israel and Ukraine more than the United States can take on at the same time?
THE PRESIDENT: No. We're the United States of America for God's sake, the most powerful nation in the history-- not in the world, in the history of the world. The history of the world. We can take care of both of these and still maintain our overall international defense.
Russia's unprovoked invasion occupies nearly 20% of Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands have been killed or wounded. In an interview last month, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told us he could lose without U.S. aid. 
PELLEY: How do these wars in Israel and Ukraine relate to the safety of the American people?
THE PRESIDENT: Overwhelmingly, they relate. For example, in Ukraine one of my objectives was to prevent Putin, who has committed war crimes himself, who-- from bein' able to occupy an independent country that borders NATO allies and is on the Russian border. Imagine what happens now if he were able to succeed. Have you ever known a major war in Europe we didn't get sucked into? We don't want that to happen. We want to make sure those democracies are sustained. And Ukraine is critical in making sure that happens.
Mr. Biden told us images of October 7th reminded him of the Holocaust—which he has studied-- taking his family to the Dachau death camp in Germany. This is 2015, the man in the wheelchair is a Dachau survivor. Behind Mr. Biden is the president's granddaughter. 
THE PRESIDENT: I want my children and grandchildren to fully understand exactly what happened and why you couldn't deny the carnage going on if you were living in Germany and in Europe.  
PELLEY: Why do you feel so strongly? What does Israel mean to you?
THE PRESIDENT: The Jews have been subject to abuse, prejudice, and-- and-- attempt to wipe them out for, oh, God, over a th-- thousand years. For me, it's about decency, respect, honor. it's just simply wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It violates every religious principle I have and every way-- and every single principle my father taught me.
As we spoke to the president, his secretary of state was in Israel, his secretary of defense was in a NATO meeting on Ukraine. America's oldest president seemed tired from directing all of this. But he was very clear on what he stood for and how his policies, in his view, would see America through. 
PELLEY: Mr. President, given these two wars and the dysfunction in Congress, are you sure that you want to run again?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes ..because.. I'm sure. Look, when I ran, I said, ""The world's at an inflection point."" The world's changing, but we have an opportunity to make it-- so, imagine if we were able to succeed in getting the Middle East put in place where we have normalization of relations. I think we can do that. Imagine what happens if we, in fact, unite all of Europe and Putin is finally put down where he cannot cause the kind of trouble he's been causing. We have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make it a better world.""	Interview with Scott Pelley of CBS News ""60 Minutes"""
"Oct 16, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-federal-bureau-investigation-report-hate-crime-statistics-for-2022,Statement on the Federal Bureau of Investigation Report on Hate Crime Statistics for 2022,"""Today the FBI released their annual statistics on hate crimes. Anti-Semitic hate crimes rose 25 percent from 2021 to 2022, and anti-Semitism accounted for over half of all reported religion-based hate crimes. Anti-LGBTQI+ hate crimes rose 16 percent, and Muslim Americans and African Americans continue to be overrepresented among victims.
The data is a reminder that hate never goes away, it only hides. Any hate crime is a stain on the soul of America.
To those Americans worried about violence at home, as a result of the evil acts of terror perpetrated by Hamas in Israel, we see you; we hear you. And I have asked members of my team, including Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas and Attorney General Garland, to prioritize the prevention and disruption of any emerging threats that could harm Jewish, Muslim, Arab American, or any other communities during this time. My administration will continue to fight anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.
Last year's data also shows that overall hate crime levels remained steady, and hate crimes targeting Asian Americans fell by 38 percent after I signed legislation to combat anti-Asian hate. But there's more to do when it comes to ending hate-fueled violence. That means coming together and speaking out against hate and bigotry in all its forms. All Americans deserve to live their lives with dignity, respect, and safety.""	Statement on the Federal Bureau of Investigation Report on Hate Crime Statistics for 2022"

Mr. President, Joe, I want to thank you for coming here today and for the unequivocal support you have given Israel during these trying times, a support that reflects the overwhelming will of the American people.
I've seen your support every day in the depth and breadth of cooperation that we have had since the beginning of this war, a level of cooperation that is truly unprecedented in the history of the great alliance between our two nations.
We see that support in your steadfast commitment to provide Israel with the tools we need to defend ourselves. We see that support in the clear message you've sent our enemies not to test our resolve and in the two American carrier battle groups that you sent to the region to back up those words with action.
But above all, Mr. President, the world sees that support in the moral clarity that you have demonstrated from the moment Israel was attacked. You've rightly drawn a clear line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism. You described what Hamas did as ""sheer evil."" It is exactly that.
Hamas murdered children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children. They burned people alive. They raped and murdered women. They beheaded soldiers. They searched for the secret hiding places where parents hid their children. And just imagine, Mr. President, the fear and the panic of those little children in their last moments as the monsters discovered—found out their hiding places.
Hamas kidnapped women, children, elderly, Holocaust survivals [survivors; White House correction]. I know you share our outrage on this, and I know you share our determination to bring these people back.
On October 7, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis, maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. That's twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7 is another day that will live in infamy.
Mr. President, you rightly said that Hamas is worse than ISIS. The German Chancellor, who visited here yesterday, said that Hamas were the new Nazis. You're both right. And just as the civilized world united to defeat the Nazis and united to defeat ISIS, the civilized world must unite to defeat Hamas.
I can assure you, Mr. President, Israel is united to defeat Hamas. And we will defeat Hamas and remove this terrible threat from our lives. The forces of civilization will prevail, for our sake, for your sake, for peace and security in our region and in the world.
Mr. President, for the people of Israel, there's only one thing better than having a true friend like you standing with Israel, and that is having you standing in Israel. Your visit here is the first visit of an American President in Israel at a time of war. It is deeply, deeply moving. It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to Israel. It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to the future of the Jewish people and the one and only Jewish state.
So I know I speak for all the people of Israel when I say: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for standing with Israel today, tomorrow, and always.
President Biden. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much.
Look, folks, I wanted to be here today for a simple reason. I wanted the people of Israel, the people of the world, to know where the United States stands.
I've had my great Secretary of State here. He's been here for—a lot. But I wanted to personally come and make that clear.
The terrorist group Hamas has slaughtered, as has been pointed out, over 1,300 people—and it is not hyperbole to suggest ""slaughtered""—""slaughtered""—and including 31 Americans as part of that.
And they've taken scores of people hostage, including children. You said: Imagine what those children hiding from Hamas were thinking. It's beyond my comprehension to be able to imagine what they were thinking. Beyond my comprehension. They're committed—evils that—atrocities that make ISIS look somewhat more rational.
You know, Americans are grieving with you. They really are. And Americans are worried. Americans are worried because we know there's—this is not an easy field to navigate what you have to do.
But the fact is that Israel, as they respond to these attacks, seems to me that—have to continue to ensure that you have what you need to defend yourselves. And we're going to make sure that occurs, as you know.
And we have to also bear in mind that Hamas does not represent all the Palestinian people and has brought them only suffering.
You know, years ago, I asked the Secretary of State, when he and I were working in the Senate, to write something for me. And he said—he wrote a line that I think is appropriate. He said, ""It's not—we lead not just""—well, I won't go into it. I'll wait until later. I'm taking too much time.
But the point is this: That I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion at the hospital in Gaza yesterday. And based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you. But there's a lot of people out there who are not sure.
So we've got a lot of—we've got to overcome a lot of things.
And it also means encouraging lifesaving capacity to help the Palestinians who are innocent, caught in the middle of this.
And—well, at any rate, that's who we are—not just me, but I mean that's who the United States is. And it's just not the example—our powers of—the power of our example that's almost as important.
The world is looking. We—Israel has a value set like the United States does and other democracies, and they're looking to see what we're going to do.
So, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm very happy to be back in Israel with you. Thank you for having me. And I'm looking forward to having a thorough discussion about where everybody goes from here. But thank you.
And I want to say to the people of Israel: Their courage, their commitment, their bravery is stunning. It's really stunning. I'm proud to be here.
Prime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.""	Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in Tel Aviv, Israel"

Mr. President, you are meeting with our united war cabinet, united and resolved to lead Israel to victory. This will be a different kind of war because Hamas is a different kind of enemy.
While Israel seeks to minimize civilian casualties, Hamas seeks to maximize civilian casualties. Hamas wants to kill as many Israelis as possible and has no regard whatsoever to Palestinian lives. Every day, they perpetrate a double war crime: targeting our civilians while hiding behind their civilians, embedding themselves in the civilian population, and using them as human shields.
We've seen the cost of this terrible double war crime against humanity that Hamas is perpetrating in the last 11 days. As Israel legitimately targets terrorists, civilians are unfortunately harmed. Hamas is responsible and should be held accountable for all civilian casualties.
We saw the cost of this terrible war crime yesterday, when a rocket fired by a Palestinian terrorist misfired and landed on a Palestinian hospital. The entire world was rightfully outraged. But this outrage should be directed not at Israel, but at the terrorists.
As we proceed in this war, Israel will do everything it can to keep civilians out of harm's way. We have asked them and we'll continue to ask them to move to safer areas. We'll continue to work with you, Mr. President, to assure that the minimal requirements are met, and we'll continue to work together to get our hostages out.
Mr. President, the road to victory will be long and hard, but united in purpose and with a deep sense of justice and the unbreakable spirit of our soldiers and our people, Israel will prevail.
Thank you, Mr. President.
President Biden. Well, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.
In the wake of Hamas's appalling terrorist assault—it was brutal, inhumane, almost beyond belief what they did—this cabinet came together and—standing strong, standing united.
And I want you to know you're not alone. You are not alone.
As I emphasized earlier, we will continue to have Israel's back as you work to defend your people. We'll continue to work with you and partners across the region to prevent more tragedy to innocent civilians.
Seventy-five years ago, your founders declared that this nation would be one based—quote, ""based on freedom, justice, and peace."" ""Based on freedom, justice, and peace."" The United States stands with you in defense of that freedom, in pursuit of that justice, and in support of that peace today, tomorrow, and always. We promise you.

Folks, there is an Irish poet named William Butler Yeats, and he wrote a line—he said: Too long a suffering makes a stone of the heart. Too long a suffering makes a stone of the heart.
The thing that I found at just this real quick meeting with all of you is none of your hearts have turned to stone yet. Every one of you talked about what you have to do—every one I talked to—about having to reach out, talked about, whether or not they were a Jew or a Muslim, reach out.
And you know, I've often said how I remember the first time that I was in Israel with Golda Meir. She was—just before the Six-Day War. And she was telling me how terrible everything was, which it was.
She kept flipping the maps up and down behind her. And all of the sudden, she looked at me, and she said, ""Would you like a photograph?"" And I thought, ""That's unusual."" And when—she just got up and walked out that door outside her office.
And we're standing there having a photograph taken like you and I are standing, looking at the press. And she—without looking at me, she turned, and she—like this, and she said, ""You look worried, Senator."" I said, ""I am."" She said: ""Don't worry, we Jews have a secret weapon in our fight. We have no place else to go.""
Well, the truth of the matter is, if there weren't an Israel, we'd have to invent one. The truth of the matter is that I believe that you—as I went home and said—I got in trouble at the time, but it was true: You don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist. You don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist.
And I think the security and safety of Jews worldwide is anchored in the continued vibrance of the State of Israel. That's what I think it's about at its core.
And so I've admired you all—this country—for so long. And I'm convinced that the more people know the—your responses to what's happening as opposed to just what war and peace is about, the more they're going to be inclined to embrace Israel.
And—but I have a lot more to say. But I'd like to talk to you in private, if I can.
Explosion at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, Palestinian Territories 
Q. What evidence have you seen—[inaudible]?
The President. The data I was shown. The data I was shown by my Defense Department.""	Remarks at a Community Engagement With Israeli Citizens Impacted by or Involved in the Response to the Hamas Attacks Against Israel and an Exchange With Reporters in Tel Aviv, Israel"
"Oct 18, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-hamas-attacks-against-israel-tel-aviv-israel,"Remarks on the Hamas Attacks Against Israel in Tel Aviv, Israel","""Good afternoon. Please have a seat.
I come to Israel with a single message: You are not alone. You are not alone. As long as the United States stands—and we will stand forever—we'll not let you ever be alone.
Most importantly, the—I know the recent terrorist assault on the people of this nation has left a deep, deep wound. More than 1,300 innocent Israelis killed, including at least 31 American citizens, by the terrorist group Hamas. Hundreds—hundreds—of young people at a music festival of—the festival was for peace—for peace—gunned down as they ran for their lives. Scores of innocents—from infants to elderly grandparents, Israelis and Americans—taken hostage.
Children slaughtered. Babies slaughtered. Entire families massacred. Rape, beheadings, bodies burned alive. Hamas committed atrocities that recall the worst ravages of ISIS, unleashing pure unadulterated evil on—upon the world. There is no rationalizing it, no excusing it. Period.
The brutality we saw would have cut deep anywhere in the world, but it cuts deeper here in Israel. October 7, which was sacred to—a sacred Jewish holiday, became the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. It has brought to the surface painful memories and scars left by millennia of anti-Semitism and the genocide of the Jewish people.
The world watched then, it knew, and the world did nothing. We will not stand by and do nothing again. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.
To those who are living in limbo waiting desperately to learn the fate of a loved one, especially to families of the hostages: You're not alone. We're working with partners throughout the region, pursuing every avenue to bring home those who are being held captive by Hamas. I can't speak publicly about all the details, but let me assure you: For me, as the American President, there is no higher priority than the release and safe return of all these hostages.
To those who are grieving a child, a parent, a spouse, a sibling, a friend, I know you feel like there's that black hole in the middle of your chest. You feel like you're being sucked into it.
The survivor's remorse, the anger, the questions of faith in your soul. Starting at—staring at that empty chair, sitting Shiva. The first Sabbath without them. They are the everyday things, the small things that you miss the most: the scent when you open the closet door; the morning coffee you shared together; the bend of his smile, the perfect pitch of her laugh, the giggle of your little boy—the baby.
For those who have lost loved ones, this is what I know: They'll never be truly gone. There's something that's never fully lost: your love for them and their love for you.
And I promise you, you'll be walking along some days and say, ""What would she or he want me to do?"" You'll smile when you pass a place that reminds you of them. That's when you know—when a smile comes to your lips before a tear to your eye—that's when you know you're going to fully make it.
That's what will give you the fortitude to find light in the darkest hours when terrorists believed they could bring down—bring you down, bend your will, break your resolve. But they never did, and they never will.
Instead, we saw incredible stories of heroism and courage, of Israelis taking care of one another. Neighbors forming watch groups to protect their kibbutz, opening their homes to shelter survivors. Retired soldiers running into danger once again. Civilian medics flying across rescue—flying rescue missions. And off-duty medics at the music festival caring for the wounded before coming victim—before becoming a victim themself. Volunteers retrieving bodies of the dead so families could bury their loved ones in accordance with Jewish tradition. Reservists leaving behind their families, their honeymoons, their studies abroad without hesitation. And so much more.
The State of Israel was born to be a safe place for the Jewish people of the world. That's why it was born. I have long said: If Israel didn't exist, we'd have to invent it.
And while it may not feel that way today, Israel must again be a safe place for the Jewish people. And I promise you: We're going to do everything in our power to make sure that it will be.
Seventy-five years ago, just 11 minutes after its founding, President Harry S. Truman and the United States of America became the first nation to recognize Israel. We have stood by your side ever since, and we're going to stand by your side now.
My administration was in close touch with your leadership from the first moments of this attack, and we are going to make sure we have—you have what you need to protect your people, to defend your nation.
For decades, we've ensured Israel's qualitative military edge. And later this week, I'm going to ask the United States Congress for an unprecedented support package for Israel's defense. We're going to keep Iron Dome fully supplied so it can continue standing sentinel over Israeli skies, saving Israeli lives.
We've moved U.S. military assets to the region, including positioning the USS Ford carrier strike group in the Eastern Mediterranean, with the USS Eisenhower on the way, to deter—to defer further aggression against Israel and to prevent this conflict from spreading.
The world will know that Israel is stronger than ever. And my message to any state or any other hostile actor thinking about attacking Israel remains the same as it was a week ago: Don't. Don't. Don't.
Since this terrorist attack took place, we have seen it described as Israel's 9/11. But for a nation the size of Israel, it was like fifteen 9/11's. The scale may be different, but I'm sure those horrors have tapped into so—some kind of primal feeling in Israel, just like it did and felt in the United States: Shock, pain, rage—an all-consuming rage. I understand, and many Americans understand.
You can't look at what has happened here to your mothers, your fathers, your grandparents, sons, daughters, children—even babies—and not scream out for justice. Justice must be done.
But I caution this: While you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.
I'm the first U.S. President to visit Israel in time of war. I've made wartime decisions. I know the choices are never clear or easy for the leadership. There's always cost.
But it requires being deliberate. It requires asking very hard questions. It requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you are on will achieve those objectives.
The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. Hamas uses innocents—innocent families—in Gaza as human shields, putting their command centers, their weapons, their communications tunnels in residential areas.
The Palestinian people are suffering greatly as well. We mourn the loss of innocent Palestinian lives. Like the entire world, I was outraged and saddened by the enormous loss of life yesterday in the hospital in Gaza. Based on the information we've seen to date, it appears the result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza.
The United States unequivocally stands for the protection of civilian life during conflict, and I grieve—I truly grieve—for the families who were killed or wounded by this tragedy.
The people of Gaza need food, water, medicine, shelter. Today I asked the Israeli cabinet—who I met with for some time this morning—to agree to the delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza. Based on the understanding that there will be inspections and that the aid should go to civilians, not to Hamas, Israel agreed that humanitarian assistance can begin to move from Egypt to Gaza.
But let me be clear: If Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, they will have demonstrated once again that they have no concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people, and it will end. As a practical matter, it will stop the international community from being able to provide this aid.
We're working in close cooperation with the Government of Egypt; the United Nations and its agencies, like the World Food Programme; and other partners in the region to get trucks moving across the border as soon as possible.
Separately, I ask Israel that the global community demand that the International Red Cross be able to visit hostages. I just demanded that the United States fully—a just demand that the United States fully supports.
Today I'm also announcing $100 million in new U.S. funding for humanitarian assistance in both Gaza and the West Bank. This money will support more than 1 million displaced and conflict-affected Palestinians, including emergency needs in Gaza.
You are a Jewish state. You are a Jewish state, but you're also a democracy. And like the United States, you don't live by the rules of terrorists. You live by the rule of law. And when conflicts flare, you live by the law of wars.
What sets us apart from the terrorists is, we believe in the fundamental dignity of every human life—Israeli, Palestinian, Arab, Jew, Muslim, Christian—everyone. You can't give up what makes you who you are. If you give that up, then the terrorists win. And we can never let them win.
You know, Israel is a miracle, a triumph of faith and resolve and resilience over impossible pain and loss. Think about October 7, the Jewish holiday where you read about the death of Moses, a tragic story of a profound loss to an entire nation; a death that could have left help—a helpless—hopelessness in the hearts of the entire—of an entire nation.
But though Moses died, his memory, his message, his lessons have lived on for generations of the Jewish people as well as many others—and just as the memory of your loved ones will live on as well.
After reading the story of Moses' death, those who observe the holiday begin reading the Torah from the very beginning. The story of creation reminds us of two things. First, that when we get knocked down, we get back up again and we begin anew. And second, when we are faced with tragedy and loss, we must go back to the beginning and remember who we are.
We are all human beings created in the image of God with dignity, humanity, and purpose. In the darkness, to be the light unto the world is what we're about. You inspire hope and light for so many around the world. That's what the terrorists seek to destroy. That's what they seek to destroy, but—because they live in darkness—but not you, not Israel.
Nations of conscience like the United States and Israel are not measured solely by the example of their power. We're measured by the power of our example. That's why, as hard as it is, we must keep pursuing peace. We must keep pursuing a path so that Israel and the Palestinian people can both live safely, in security, in dignity, and in peace.
For me, that means a two-state solution. We must keep working for Israel's greater integration with its neighbors. These attacks have only strengthened my commitment and determination and my will to get that done.
I'm here to tell you that terrorists will not win. Freedom will win.
So let me end where I began. Israel, you are not alone. The United States stands with you.
I've told the story before—and I'll tell it again—of my first meeting with an Israeli Prime Minister 50 years ago as a young Senator. I was sitting across from Golda Meir at her desk in her office. And she had a guy named—a guy who later became Prime Minister sitting next to me, just before the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
And she flipped the maps up and down, telling me how bad things were and how terrible they were. All of a sudden, she looked and me, and she said, ""Would you like a photograph?"" And I looked at her—she got up from her desk and walked out into that hallway—I think it's marble flooring—walked out in the hallway.
We walked out, and there were a bunch of photographers standing in front of us. We were standing shoulder to shoulder. Without her looking at me, she said to me, knowing I'd hear her, ""Why do you look so worried, Senator Biden?"" And I said, ""Worried?"" Like, ""Of course, I'm worried."" And she looked at me and—she didn't look, she said: ""We—don't worry, Senator, we Israelis have a secret weapon: We have nowhere else to go.""
Well, today I say to all of Israel: The United States isn't going anywhere either. We're going to stand with you. We'll walk beside you in those dark days, and we'll walk beside you in the good days to come. And they will come.
As you say in Hebrew, which I'm not going to attempt to do because I'm such a terrible linguist, I'll say it in English, ""The people of Israel live."" ""The people of Israel live."" Israel will be a safe, secure, Jewish, and Democratic state today, tomorrow, and forever.
May God protect all those who work for peace. God save those who are still in harm's way.
Thank you very much.

Q. Hi, sir.
Q. It's good to see you.
The President. I wanted to bring you up to date. I just got off the phone with——
Q. Hold on, sir. Hold on. Hold on.
The President. ——with President Sisi of Egypt.
When we took off, my goal was multifold, but basically to get humanitarian aid into Gaza and to get as many Americans out who wanted to get out—could get out as possible.
And so, we got a commitment, as you know, from the Israelis, including their unanimous vote of their war cabinet and the Prime Minister.
And the second thing was that I wanted to make sure there was a vehicle, a mechanism, that this could happen quickly.
And so I have been on the phone for the last—I don't know. We've been on the ground a while. That's why we haven't taken off——
Q. About an hour.
The President. ——with Elsisi. I don't think I was on that long. It was about probably half an hour. And both—my team here was with me.
And he agreed that what he would do is open the gate on—to do two things: one, let up to 20 trucks through to begin with.
Satterfield, my Ambassador, is down there in—not down there—in Cairo now. He's going to coordinate this. He has my authority to do what is needed to get it done.
They're going to patch the road. They have to fill in potholes to get these trucks through. And that's going to occur; they expect it will take about 8 hours tomorrow. So there may be nothing rolling through until—what's today? I'm losing track of days.
Q. Wednesday.
The President. Thursday? Wednesday? Probably until Friday.
Gaza/Humanitarian Situation 
Q. Is this the Rafah Crossing you're talking about?
The President. Yes.
Q. Okay. So Sisi agreed to open that up?
The President. Yes. For this purpose. For this purpose. Not to allow a lot of people out, but to open it up for this purpose.
Humanitarian Assistance for Gaza
Q. For humanitarian assistance?
The President. For the humanitarian—for the trucks to be able to get through.
Q. And is that just——
Q. Twenty trucks?
The President. Well, look, what I—you guys are such a pain in the neck. You know? [Laughter]
Q. Sorry, sir.
The President. But I—here's the deal: up to 20 trucks. This has been a very blunt negotiation I've had. And so we want to get as many of the trucks out as possible. There's, I guess, 150 or something there. Not all of them will go the first tranche. If there's a second tranche—see how it goes.
The commitment is, if in fact they cross the border, the U.N. is going to be on the other side distributing this material—offloading it and then distributing it, which is going to take a little time to set up, probably.
But the point being that if the—if Hamas confiscates it or doesn't let it get through or just confiscates it, then it's going to end, because we're not going to be sending any humanitarian aid to Hamas if they're going to be confiscating it. That's the commitment that I've made.
And so the bottom line is that Elsisi deserves some real credit because he was very accommodating and, quite frankly, as everyone that I've spoken to thus far since this trip began.
And I—but the Admiral is going to stick here and other team—answer any real hard questions. And I'm going to get the hell out of here before you start asking about the House of Representatives. [Laughter] Okay?
The President's Travel Schedule/The President's Regional Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. Are you disappointed that you had to cancel the stop in Jordan?
The President. No. [Laughter] Disappointed? Look, I came to get something done. I got it done. If it—if I didn't—if I did—wasn't able to make it into the—into Israel, I got it done—I'd get it done. This is—as you guys know, this was a—let me choose my words here.
Not many people thought we could get this done, and not many people want to be associated with failure. And there was, quite frankly, a lengthly—lengthy, hour or more discussion about whether to go. Because had we gone and this failed, then, you know, the United States failed, Biden's Presidency failed, et cetera, which would be a legitimate criticism.
And right now I have a very good relationship with the Jordanian King. It's close. I know him well, and I also spent time on the telephone in the past with the Palestinian Authority leadership. But they're all in a tough spot——
Jordan-U.S. Relations/Palestinian Authority 
Q. That was today?
The President. No, no, no. Just over the last 5 years—10 years.
And—but they—we're putting all of them in a tough situation if we didn't get this done. And so, it had to be, in my view, we either—either took all the blame or—and not have put anybody else on the spot of being put on the spot—or get it done. And I thought it was worth taking the chance to get it done.
Q. We were told you were going to ask——
President Abdelfattah Said Elsisi of Egypt/Hamas Attacks in Israel/Middle East Peace Efforts/Regional Integration 
Q. So, you talked to Sisi for quite a—quite a long time to work this out. Was he reluctant to—to do this?
The President. Not at all. He was completely cooperative. 
Q. Okay.
The President. I've had a decent relationship with him. He's got his own problems on other issues. He's got—his entire border is—there's wars going on on every side of his country. [Laughter] And so he was—I've known him a while. He was, fair to say, very cooperative.
I mean, there was no—I thought I'd have to spend more time trying to convince him on the timing, but he was—he stepped up. And—as did Bibi. And I was, as you—well, they probably told you, I was very blunt with the Israelis.
And—because, look, Israel has been badly victimized, but you know, the truth is that if they have an opportunity to relieve suffering of people who are—have nowhere to go, they're going to be—it's what they should do. And if they don't, they'll be held accountable in ways that may be unfair, but that's what we—and my point to everyone is, look, if you have an opportunity to alleviate the pain, you should do it. Period. And if you don't, you're going to lose credibility worldwide. And I think everyone understands that.
Humanitarian Corridors for Gazan Refugees 
Q. What about getting people out? [Inaudible]—people evacuate?
National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John F. Kirby. Guys, we've got to—we've got to let the President get back——
The President. The answer is, we're going to get people out, but I'm not going to go into any detail with you now.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. All right. We've got to wrap up guys. We've got to wrap it up.
Q. Anything more about the hospital, sir?
Humanitarian Assistance for Gaza 
Q. You said you were very blunt with the Israelis on the need to get humanitarian aid to Gaza, or what exactly?
The President. On everything. [Laughter] We—no, I was very blunt about the need to support getting humanitarian aid to Gaza—get it to Gaza and do it quickly. And——
Press Secretary Jean-Pierre. All right.
The President. And that——
Press Secretary Jean-Pierre. Sorry, sir. I don't want to step on you.
Q. Any more about the hospital, sir?
The President. Well, don't. Okay? [Laughter]
Potential U.S. Involvement in Israeli Military Operations
Q. May I ask you about—there's a report in the Times of Israel that says ""Biden officials have indicated to Israel in recent days that if Hizballah initiates a war against Israel, the U.S. military will join the IDF in fighting the terrorist group.""
The President. Not true.
Q. Not true?
The President. That was never said.
Israeli Military Operations 
Q. Do you think there's a lesser chance now that Israel won't go in and—into Gaza and that can be averted?
The President. We had a long talk about that and what alternatives there are. Our military is talking with their military about what the alternatives are, but I'm not going to go into that either.
U.S. Humanitarian Assistance to Gaza 
Q. Did you find Bibi receptive to the humanitarian argument you made and——
The President. Yes.
Q. Was there any pushback from him, or you felt that——
The President. No.
Q. ——you were able to get across that——
The President. But we've had a number of discussions on this. It's not new. Look, I don't know what you picked up in Israel, but I got no pushback. Virtually none. Let me say it again: I got no pushback.
Q. From the Israelis or from every——
The President. From——
Q. ——all the partners here?
The President. All the partners. Virtually none. And this is—look, it's—at any rate.
But I'm hopeful we can get some Americans out as well of Gaza, and I'm—hopefully, we will continue to work towards getting other Americans out through other means as well.
The President's Meeting With Israelis Impacted by or Involved in the Response to the Hamas Attacks Against Israel 
Q. Can you talk about the impact of meeting survivors and the first responders?
The President. That's all personal. Look, I—I spent an hour and a half, about, with 17 or 18 before—I spent with them and—I don't know how to say this.
Virtually every mass shooting, every circumstance where a large number of people have been victimized and lost, I've spoken with them. I learned a long time ago, which you've all learned in your life as well, when someone is going through something that is beyond their comprehension that they never thought they'd have to go through, if they see someone who they think understands or maybe been through something—not the same, but similar—it gives them some sense of hope.
And I always get criticized sometimes by my staff because when I go to these events, I stay for 3 or 4 hours and answer all their questions. But it matters. It matters a lot.
And look, I'm talking—some of you have gone through a hell of a lot more than I've gone through and a lot more than other people have gone through, and you understand.
So it's just—it's just a—people are looking for just something to grab, something that gives them some sense of hope. And that's—if I can do a little bit of that, then it's—you know, it's worth doing. It was done for me, so——
Okay?
Q. You said that the hospital, sir——
Q. Do you think it was necessary for you to come here to get this deal done? Was the in-person diplomacy aspect really important here?
Israel-U.S. Relations 
The President. What do you think? I'll let you answer that.
Speaker of the House of Representatives Selection Process 
Q. You joked about the House. Do you have any view of Jim Jordan and his predicament at the moment?
The President. Do I have any what?
Q. Do you have a view of Jim Jordan's current predicament, unable to secure the Speakership?
The President. I ache for him. No. No. [Laughter] Zero. None. None.
Q. Mr. President——
Explosion at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, Palestinian Territories 
Q. How about the hospital, sir? People all over the region are upset about the hospital and don't necessarily believe you or the Israelis that they didn't have anything to with it. Do you have a message to the people in the streets right now?
The President. Well, I can understand why, in this circumstance, they wouldn't believe. I can understand that.
And—but I would not—you'll notice I don't say things like that unless I have faith in the source from which I've gotten it. Our Defense Department says it's highly unlikely that it was the Israelis. It would have had a different footprint. And they've intercepted some—anyway.
They—and so that's why, if you notice, I didn't say it at first. I didn't—I wanted to make sure that I knew.
And look—and I'm not suggesting that Hamas deliberately did it either. It's that old thing: You've got to learn how to shoot straight. You know, and it's not the first time Hamas has launched something that didn't function very well.
So I don't know all the detail, but I do know the people at the Defense Department, who I respect, and the intelligence community that I respect, and it's highly improbable that Israel did that.
Q. Mr. President, is—are the Israelis operating within the rules of war that you talked about last week being so important?
The President. It's been good talking to you all. [Laughter]
Q. Thank you, sir.
Strategic Communications Coordinator Kirby. Thanks, everybody. Thanks, guys. Thank you.
Q. Thank you, sir.
Q. Appreciate it.
Q. John, do we have more?
Strategic Communications Coordinator Kirby. Do you have more questions?

"Oct 19, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-the-united-states-response-the-hamas-attacks-against-israel-and-russias,Address to the Nation on the United States Response to the Hamas Attacks Against Israel and Russia's War Against Ukraine,"""Good evening, my fellow Americans. We're facing an inflection point in history, one of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come. That's what I'd like to talk with you about tonight.
You know, earlier this morning I returned from Israel. They tell me I'm the first American President to travel there during a war. I met with the Prime Minister and members of his cabinet. And most movingly, I met with Israelis who had personally lived through horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October.
More than 1,300 people slaughtered in Israel, including at least 32 American citizens. Scores of innocents—from infants to the elderly grandparents, Israelis, Americans—taken hostage.
And as I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas, we're pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. As President, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage.
The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world. But sadly, the Jewish people know, perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others.
In Israel, I saw a people who are strong, determined, resilient, and also angry, in shock, and in deep, deep pain.
I also spoke with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and reiterated that the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and to self-determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don't take that right away.
Like so many other, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, including the explosion at the hospital in Gaza, which was not done by the Israelis. We mourn every innocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity.
You know, the assault on Israel echoes nearly 20 months of war, tragedy, and brutality inflicted on the people of Ukraine, people that were very badly hurt since Putin launched his all-out invasion.
We've have not forgotten the mass graves, the bodies found bearing signs of torture, rape used as a weapon by the Russians, and thousands and thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly taken into Russia, stolen from their parents. It's sick.
Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy—completely annihilate it.
Hamas—its stated purpose for existing is the destruction of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people. Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields, and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of them.
Meanwhile, Putin denies Ukraine has or ever had real statehood. He claims the Soviet Union created Ukraine. And just 2 weeks ago, he told the world that if the United States and our allies withdraw—and if the United States withdraw, our allies will as well—military support for Ukraine would have, quote, ""a week left to live."" But we're not withdrawing.
I know these conflicts can seem far away. And it's natural to ask: Why does this matter to America?
So let me share with you why making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America's national security. You know, history has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going, and the cost and the threats to America and the world keep rising.
So if we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won't limit himself just to Ukraine. He's—Putin's already threated to ""remind""—quote, ""remind"" Poland that their western land was a gift from Russia.
One of his top advisers, a former President of Russia, has called Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania Russia's ""Baltic provinces."" These are all NATO allies.
For 75 years, NATO has kept peace in Europe and has been the cornerstone of American security. And if Putin attacks a NATO ally, we will defend every inch of NATO which the treaty requires and calls for.
We will have something that we do not seek—make it clear: we do not seek—we do not seek to have American troops fighting in Russia or fighting against Russia.
Beyond Europe, we know that our allies and, maybe most importantly, our adversaries and competitors are watching. They're watching our response in Ukraine as well.
And if we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would-be aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same. The risk of conflict and chaos could spread in other parts of the world—in the Indo-Pacific, in the Middle East—especially in the Middle East.
Iran is supporting Russia's—in Ukraine, and it's supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups in the region. And we'll continue to hold them accountable, I might add.
The United States and our partners across the region are working to build a better future for the Middle East, one where the Middle East is more stable, better connected to its neighbors, and—through innovative projects like the India-Middle East-Europe rail corridor that I announced this year at the summit of the world's biggest economies. More predictable markets, more employment, less rage, less grievances, less war when connected. It benefits the people—it would benefit the people of the Middle East, and it would benefit us.
American leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe. American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with. To put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine, if we turn our backs on Israel, it's just not worth it.
That's why, tomorrow, I'm going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America's national security needs, to support our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine. It's a smart investment that's going to pay dividends for American security for generations, help us keep American troops out of harm's way, help us build a world that is safer, more peaceful, and more prosperous for our children and grandchildren.
In Israel, we must make sure that they have what they need to protect their people today and always. The security package I'm sending to Congress and asking Congress to do is an unprecedented commitment to Israel's security that will sharpen Israel's qualitative military edge, which we've committed to—the qualitative military edge.
We're going to make sure Iron Dome continues to guard the skies over Israel. We're going to make sure other hostile actors in the region know that Israel is stronger than ever and prevent this conflict from spreading.
Look, at the same time, President [Prime Minister; White House correction] Netanyahu and I discussed again yesterday the critical need for Israel to operate by the laws of war. That means protecting civilians in combat as best as they can.
The people of Gaza urgently need food, water, and medicine. Yesterday, in discussions with the leaders of Israel and Egypt, I secured an agreement for the first shipment of humanitarian assistance from the United Nations to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. If Hamas does not divert or steal this shipment—these shipments, we're going to provide an opening for sustained delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians.
And as I said in Israel: As hard as it is, we cannot give up on peace. We cannot give up on a two-state solution. Israel and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity, and peace.
You know, and here at home, we have to be honest with ourselves. In recent years, too much hate has given too much oxygen, fueling racism, a rise of anti-Semitism and Islamicphobia [Islamophobia; White House correction] right here in America.
It's also intensified in the wake of recent events that led to the horrific threats and attacks that both shock us and break our hearts.
On October 7, terror attacks have triggered deep scars and terrible memories in the Jewish community. Today, Jewish families worried about being targeted in school, wearing symbols of their faith walking down the street, or going out about their daily lives.
You know, I know many of you in the Muslim American community, the Arab American community, the Palestinian American community, and so many others are outraged and hurting, saying to yourselves, ""Here we go again,"" with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11.
Just last week, a mother was brutally stabbed, and a little boy—here in the United States—a little boy who had just turned 6 years old was murdered in their home outside of Chicago. His name was Wadea—Wadea—a proud American, a proud Palestinian American family.
We can't stand by and stand silent when this happens. We must, without equivocation, denounce anti-Semitism. We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia.
And to all of you hurting—those of you who are hurting, I want you to know: I see you. You belong. And I want to say this to you: You're all America. You're all America.
This is in a moment where there's—you know, in moments like these, when fear and suspicion, anger and rage run hard, that we have to work harder than ever to hold on to the values that make us who we are. We're a nation of religious freedom, freedom of expression. We all have a right to debate and disagree without fear of being targeted at schools or workplaces or in our communities. And we must renounce violence and vitriol, see each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans.
When I was in Israel yesterday, I said that when America experienced the hell of 9/11, we felt enraged as well. While we sought and got justice, we made mistakes. So I cautioned the Government of Israel not to be blinded by rage.
And here in America, let us not forget who we are. We reject all forms—all forms—of hate, whether against Muslims, Jews, or anyone. That's what great nations do, and we are great nation.
On Ukraine, I'm asking Congress to make sure we can continue to send Ukraine the weapons they need to defend themselves and their country without interruption so Ukraine can stop Putin's brutality in Ukraine.
They are succeeding. When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he would take Kyiv and all of Ukraine in a matter of days. Well, over a year later, Putin has failed, and he continues to fail. Kyiv still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Ukraine has regained more than 50 percent of the territory Russian troops once occupied, backed by a U.S.-led coalition of more than 50 countries around the world all doing its part to support Kyiv.
What would happen if we walked away? We are the essential nation.
Meanwhile, Putin has turned to Iran and North Korea to buy attack drones and ammunition to terrorize Ukrainian cities and people.
From the outset, I have said I will not send American troops to fight in Ukraine. All Ukraine is asking for is help—for the weapons, munitions, the capacity, the capability to push invading Russian forces off their land, and the air defense systems to shoot down Russian missiles before they destroy Ukrainian cities.
And let me be clear about something: We send Ukraine equipment sitting in our stockpiles. And when we use the money allocated by Congress, we use it to replenish our own stores—our own stockpiles with new equipment—equipment that defends America and is made in America: Patriot missiles for air defense batteries made in Arizona; artillery shells manufactured in 12 States across the country—in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas; and so much more.
You know, just as in World War II, today, patriotic American workers are building the arsenal of democracy and serving the cause of freedom.
Let me close with this. Earlier this year, I boarded Air Force One for a secret flight to Poland. There, I boarded a train with blacked-out windows for a 10-hour ride each way to Kyiv to stand with the people of Ukraine ahead of the 1-year anniversary of their brave fight against Putin.
And I'm told I was the first American [President; White House correction] to enter a war zone not controlled by the United States military since President Lincoln. With me was just a small group of security personnel and a few advisers.
But when I exited that train and met Zelenskyy—President Zelenskyy, I didn't feel alone. I was bringing with me the idea of America, the promise of America to the people who are today fighting for the same things we fought for 250 years ago: freedom, independence, self-determination.
And as I walked through Kyiv with President Zelenskyy, with air raid sirens sounding in the distance, I felt something I've always believed more strongly than ever before: America is a beacon to the world still. Still.
We are, as my friend Madeleine Albright said, ""the indispensable nation.""
Tonight there are innocent people all over the world who hope because of us, who believe in a better life because of us, who are desperate not to be forgotten by us, and who are waiting for us.
But time is of the essence.
I know we have our divisions at home. We have to get past them. We can't let petty, partisan, angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation. We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen.
In moments like these, we have to remind—we have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America—the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we do it together.
My fellow Americans, thank you for your time.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.""	Address to the Nation on the United States Response to the Hamas Attacks Against Israel and Russia's War Against Ukraine"
"Oct 20, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-president-charles-yvon-michel-the-european-council-and,"Joint Statement by President Biden, President Charles Yvon Michel of the European Council, and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission","""1. The United States and the European Union and its Member States, representing nearly 800 million citizens, united by our values and bound together by the most dynamic economic relationship on earth, reaffirm our commitment to a transatlantic partnership that delivers for all our people. Since the last U.S.-EU Summit in June 2021, the world has changed in unprecedented ways, and we have taken ambitious steps in response. Together, we are working to secure peace, stability, and prosperity regionally and across the world, including in our steadfast support for Ukraine. We are deepening our cooperation to reflect the pressing challenges and opportunities of our time—strengthening our economic security; advancing reliable, sustainable, affordable, and secure energy transitions in our economies and globally; reinforcing multilateralism and international cooperation; and harnessing digital technologies to work for, not against, our shared values of democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law. We are more united than ever.
A. TOWARD A MORE SECURE AND STABLE WORLD 
Situation in the Middle East 
2. We condemn in the strongest possible terms Hamas and its brutal terrorist attacks across Israel. There is no justification for terrorism. We affirm Israel's right to defend itself against these heinous attacks, in line with international law, including international humanitarian law. We will work closely with partners in the region to stress the importance of protecting civilians, supporting those who are trying to get to safety or provide assistance, and facilitating access to food, water, medical care, and shelter. We are concerned by the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. It is crucial to prevent regional escalation. We call for the immediate release of all hostages and emphasize our shared view that a two-state solution remains the viable path to lasting peace
Russia's War against Ukraine and Support for Regional Stability 
3. The United States and the European Union remain unwavering in our long-term political, financial, humanitarian, and military support to Ukraine and its people as they defend themselves against Russia's illegal and unprovoked war of aggression. We stand together in calling for Russia to end its brutal war and to withdraw its military forces and proxies and military equipment immediately, completely, and unconditionally from the entire internationally recognized territory of Ukraine. We are committed to achieving the widest possible international support for the key principles and objectives of Ukraine's Peace Formula. Any initiative for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine must be based on full respect for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, within its internationally recognized borders and uphold all the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.
4. We are committed to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We recognize the urgency of ensuring that Russia does not succeed in collapsing the Ukrainian economy and of intensifying our efforts to help ensure assistance meets Ukraine's highest priority needs. As co-chairs, along with Ukraine, of the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform, we are working together with Ukraine as it develops its Ukraine Plan, embedded in its European path, to incorporate a common set of near-term priority economic, rule-of-law, and democratization reforms and a prioritized and well-coordinated approach to recovery and reconstruction assistance and investment. The United States and the European Union, together with other international donors, will continue to provide Ukraine with financing to help achieve these objectives, including to defend, repair, and rebuild its energy sector aligned with EU standards. We acknowledge Ukraine's commitment and progress in their reform efforts, and underline the strategic importance of its EU accession process.
5. Russia must cease its aggression and must bear the legal consequences of all its internationally wrongful acts, including compensation for the damage caused to Ukraine. We are united in our determination to ensure full accountability. In light of the urgency of disrupting Russia's attempts to destroy the Ukrainian economy and Russia's continued failure to abide by its international law obligations, the United States and the European Union, together with our allies, are convening our experts to explore options to compensate Ukraine in a timely manner for the loss, injury, and damage resulting from Russia's aggression. We are exploring all possible avenues to aid Ukraine, consistent with our respective legal systems and international law. We are also working together with the global community to address the energy, economic, and food security challenges caused by Russia's war of choice, which are particularly acute in the most vulnerable developing countries. We condemn Russia's attempts to block food exports and its attacks on Ukraine's grain storage and shipment facilities since its withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The EU's Solidarity Lanes remain instrumental in bolstering global food security.
6. As part of our efforts to aid Ukraine, in the short term, we will explore how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from immobilized Russian sovereign assets, where those extraordinary revenues are not required to meet obligations towards Russia under applicable laws, could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction in compliance with applicable laws.
7. We will deepen our joint work to undermine Russia's ability to wage its war, and maintain and expand its defense industrial base and capacity. Those who help Russia acquire items or equipment for its defense industrial base are supporting actions which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine. This includes companies supplying certain critical raw materials and high-priority items to Russia, as well as the financial institutions and other entities facilitating such transfers. We will target third-country actors who materially support Russia's war. We will continue to vigorously and jointly enforce our sanctions and export control measures to disrupt circumvention and backfill. Our joint implementation of the G7+ price cap for seaborne Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products supports energy market stability while diminishing Russia's ability to finance its illegal war. We intend to act, consistent with our respective legal authorities, where we have evidence indicating violations or deceptive practices related to the price cap policy.
8. We reaffirm our support for the Republic of Moldova's territorial integrity and sovereignty. The European Council decided in June to grant the status of candidate country to the Republic of Moldova. We will continue to support Moldova in addressing the challenges it faces as a consequence of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and in reform efforts on its European path. We remain fully committed to supporting Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and its European perspective. We reaffirm our shared commitment to stability in the Western Balkans and our support to the EU perspective of the region. All partners should continue making the reforms required to progress on their European path. We note the need for Kosovo and Serbia to urgently de-escalate tensions and to swiftly and unconditionally implement the agreement on the path to normalization of their relations and return to the EU-facilitated Dialogue. We remain committed to advancing a lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan based on mutual recognition of sovereignty, inviolability of borders and territorial integrity. We urge Azerbaijan to ensure the rights and security of those who remain in Nagorno-Karabakh as well as for those who wish to return to their homes. We also call for all parties to adhere to the principle of non-use of force and threat of use of force.
Africa 
9. The United States and the European Union share a common interest in a thriving, peaceful, democratic, and resilient Africa, and welcome the accession of the African Union as a permanent member of the G20. We will work together to continue to enhance synergies in our cooperation with all our African partners. We are committed to promoting the security, stability and prosperity of North Africa. We reaffirm our commitment to tackle common security challenges in the Sahel, including the fight against terrorism, in cooperation with ECOWAS.
Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific 
10. We reiterate our shared commitment to enhancing coordination and cooperation in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific with the aim of contributing to the stability, security, prosperity and sustainable development of the region, based on the promotion of democracy, rule of law, human rights and international law. Consistent with our respective Indo-Pacific strategies, we will seek opportunities to enhance practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, including through the biannual U.S.-EU Indo-Pacific Consultations. This includes expanding maritime domain awareness, encouraging cooperation on connectivity, responding to foreign information manipulation and interference, increasing coordination on cyber cooperation, and encouraging ongoing efforts to uphold fundamental freedoms and human rights. We reaffirm our unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity and our commitment to promoting cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We also reaffirm our partnership with Pacific Island countries and reiterate the importance of supporting their priorities and needs in accordance with the Pacific Islands Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.
11. We reiterate our support for international law, in particular as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and for the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law, including under UNCLOS dispute settlement mechanisms.
China 
12. The United States and European Union recall our discussions in other fora, including the G7, on the principles that underpin our relations with China. We stand prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China, recognizing the importance of engaging candidly with and expressing our concerns directly to China. It is necessary to cooperate with China, given its role in the international community and the size of its economy, on global challenges as well as areas of common interest. We call on China to engage with us, including in international fora, on areas such as the climate and biodiversity crisis, addressing vulnerable countries' debt sustainability and financing needs, global health and pandemic preparedness, and macroeconomic stability.
13. With a view to enabling sustainable economic relations with China, we will push for a level playing field for our firms and workers. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. At the same time, we recognize that economic resilience requires de-risking and diversifying. In this context, we will invest in our own economic vibrancy and reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities, including in our supply chains. We also recognize the necessity of protecting certain advanced technologies that could be used to threaten global peace and security, without unduly limiting trade and investment. We will foster resilience to economic coercion. We will address challenges posed by non-market policies and practices.
14. We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. We underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in the one China policy of the United States or of the European Union.
15. We will keep voicing our concerns about the human rights and forced labor in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang. With respect to Hong Kong, we call on China to honor its previous commitments with respect to Hong Kong under the Sino-Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.
16. We call on China to press Russia to stop its war of aggression, and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine. We encourage China to support a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on territorial integrity and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, including through its direct dialogue with Ukraine.
Strengthening Cooperation on Security and Defense 
17. We will further strengthen and deepen EU-U.S. cooperation and engagement on security and defense. This could include enhancing practical cooperation in operational theatres of mutual interest. NATO remains the foundation of collective defense for its Allies and essential for Euro Atlantic security. We recognize the value of a stronger and more capable European defense that contributes positively to global and transatlantic security and is complementary to, and interoperable with NATO. We welcome the signature of the Administrative Arrangement between the United States Department of Defense and the European Defense Agency.
Partnering with Emerging Economies and Developing Countries 
18. The United States and the European Union are committed to accelerating progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and to mobilizing additional financing for development. To this end, we are committed to advancing reforms for better, bigger, and more effective multilateral development banks to address global challenges and countries' core development needs. This includes the implementation of critical financial reforms and a review of the climate finance architecture to make it more effective and efficient. We commit to raising the level of ambition to deliver more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank's capacity to support low- and middle-income countries addressing global challenges, with a clear framework for the allocation of scarce concessional resources, and to provide strong support for the poorest countries. The United States and the European Union will step up efforts to deliver substantial contributions to this end.
19. Given the massive scale of need, greater private capital mobilization must play a significant role in meeting our objectives. We will continue to champion efforts to unlock private capital and will work with G7 partners through respective actions, to scale the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, including the European Union's Global Gateway strategy, and mobilize $600 billion in quality infrastructure investments in low- and middle-income countries by 2027. Building on the discussions on U.S.-EU collaboration on the Trans-African Corridor and the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor, we are working towards identifying additional regional economic corridors to cooperate on to unlock inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
20. The United States and the European Union will also continue their efforts to promote digital inclusion and trustworthy information and communication technology and services supply chains around the world and pursue cooperation to develop a common vision and industry roadmap on research and development for 6G wireless communication systems.
B. STRENGTHENED U.S.-EU ECONOMIC COOPERATION 
21. The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) is the key forum for our cooperation on trade and technology matters. We commend the progress made and encourage advancing joint work in the run up to the upcoming TTC ministerial meeting later in 2023.
22. The United States and the European Union are committed to strengthening the transatlantic marketplace to support decent jobs and economic opportunities with an emphasis on mutually beneficial resilience and sustainability of our supply chains. We will advance the implementation of the Transatlantic Initiative on Sustainable Trade focusing on facilitating mutually beneficial trade across the Atlantic of products and technologies that underpin the transition to a climate-neutral economy.
Building the Sustainable and Resilient Economies of the Future 
23. The United States and the European Union are deepening our collaboration to address the urgent and interdependent crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and urge ambitious action by all other major players. We will work expeditiously to implement the Paris Agreement, halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity globally and protect the ocean. We will intensify our outreach to third countries, notably in view of the 28th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28), making every effort to keep a 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global temperature warming within reach. We are committed to working together and with others for COP28 to reach bold commitments to dramatically increase global renewable energy capacity and energy efficiency while supporting a global shift away from unabated fossil fuels, including an end to new unabated coal fired power plants. We will continue to lead efforts to cut methane to support achieving the Global Methane Pledge and look forward to a robust Methane Finance Sprint announcement at COP28.
24. Together, we will work to build climate neutral, circular, resource efficient and resilient economies, to promote internationally recognized labor rights, and to improve the resilience and sustainability of critical supply chains. We will continue our work to advance the energy transition to climate neutrality and bolster energy security through the Joint Energy Security Task Force and U.S.-EU Energy Council.
25. We are making bold public investments in our respective economies, and will continue to also expand research collaboration, to ignite a clean industrial revolution and, with it, good jobs, and make our industries more sustainable and competitive. We will continue ongoing cooperation toward this end, and work openly and transparently against zero-sum competition to maximize clean energy deployment, including through our Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue.
26. We have made progress toward a targeted critical minerals agreement for the purpose of expanding access to sustainable, secure, and diversified high-standard critical mineral and battery supply chains and enabling those minerals extracted or processed in the European Union to count toward requirements for clean vehicles in the Section 30D clean vehicle tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act. We look forward to continuing to make progress and consulting with our respective stakeholders on these negotiations in the coming weeks.
Expanding Technology Cooperation and Exchanges 
27. The United States and the European Union are stepping up our joint efforts to promote an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, secure, innovative, and competitive digital ecosystem. We are cooperating to manage the risks and harness the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), working alongside our partners in the G7, OECD, and other multilateral fora. We affirm our continued work through the TTC Joint Roadmap on Trustworthy AI and Risk Management to further guide the development of tools, methodologies, and approaches to AI risk management and trustworthy AI. We confirm our joint intention to endorse a code of conduct for organizations developing advanced AI systems as part of the G7 Hiroshima process in the near term. We confirm our commitment to use AI for Public Good, particularly in the areas of agriculture, extreme weather prediction, emergency management and response, electric grid optimization, and health and medical research. As new and more advanced AI systems emerge, we plan to build on work done to promote responsible AI and work with industry, civil society, academia, and other stakeholders to enable trustworthy development and uptake of those technologies, and to advance our shared vision of responsible innovation in line with our shared democratic values. We recognize the importance of expanding research collaboration between the European Union and the United States for critical and emerging technologies such as AI, quantum, renewable energy, and other key areas, including by enabling transatlantic research funding activities that allow for both U.S. and EU researcher leadership while considering reciprocity in access to respective U.S. and EU research programs and ensuring symmetry in managing intellectual property. We commit to working together to finalize an agreement on quantum-related items for the upcoming TTC meetings.
28. We aim to build a more secure cyberspace together. We endeavor to cooperate to promote high cybersecurity standards to protect consumers and business and decrease vulnerability to cyberattacks. To that end, we commit to work together on achieving mutual recognition for our government-backed cybersecurity labeling programs and regulations for Internet-of-things devices aiming at a Joint CyberSafe Products Action Plan. We will work for consumers in Europe and the United States to have an easy and reliable way to assess whether devices they bring into their homes, offices, and schools are secure.
Promoting Rules-Based Trade and Countering Unfair Competition 
29. The United States and the European Union have a shared interest in reforming the WTO so that Members can better achieve the WTO's foundational objectives and address modern-day imperatives. We will work towards substantial WTO reform by MC13 in 2024 including by conducting discussions with the view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all WTO Members by 2024.
30. On 31 October 2021, we announced that we would negotiate within two years an arrangement—known as the Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminum (Global Arrangement)—to address non-market excess capacity and emissions intensity of the steel and aluminum industries, including to foster undistorted transatlantic trade. Throughout these two years, we have made substantial progress to identify the sources of non-market excess capacity. We have also achieved a better understanding of the tools to address the emissions intensity of the steel and aluminum industries. We look forward to continuing to make progress on these important objectives in the next two months.
Strengthening Economic Resilience and Economic Security 
31. The United States and the European Union are continuing to cooperate to enhance the resilience of our economies and advance our economic security interests, underpinned by a rules-based system, while preserving an open economy and a global level playing field. We will de-risk and diversify where we assess there are risks through proportionate, precise and targeted measures to address economic security challenges. We will continue working together to reduce excessive dependencies in critical supply chains, in close cooperation with partner countries. We share concerns about the challenges posed by, among other issues, economic coercion, the weaponization of economic dependencies, and non-market policies and practices. We will continue this work through inter alia the TTC, and with the G7 and other partners to diversify our supply chains and increase our collective preparedness, assessment, deterrence, and response to economic coercion.
32. We have a shared interest in protecting those advanced technologies that could be used to undermine global peace and security, and are developing our respective economic security toolkits to ensure our companies' capital, expertise, and innovations will not be used to do so. Recognizing that outbound investment measures are necessary to complement its existing economic security toolkit, the President of the United States has issued an Executive Order to address risks from outbound investment and is consulting stakeholders on the U.S. rules. The European Union and its Member States are similarly exploring, based on a risk assessment, whether outbound investment measures could complement its existing toolkit. Export control regimes are central to maintain international security and stability, and necessitate cooperation between actors—including in multilateral fora—to ensure our dual-use technology protection ecosystem is continuously improved upon and cannot be exploited. We will cooperate and share lessons as we work to maximize the effectiveness of our economic security toolkit to achieve our shared interest.
33. Foreign information manipulation and interference is a borderless threat that poses a risk to democratic values, processes, and stability. We will expand collaboration based on common principles, such as dedicated strategies, internal organizational structures, capacity, civil society and multilateral engagement. This cooperation should aim to support like-minded partners in countering foreign information manipulation and interference, including via U.S. and EU coordinated activities, while safeguarding freedom of expression together with partner countries.
Expanding People-to-People Contacts 
34. To preserve the strength and longevity of our transatlantic relationship, the United States and the European Union also endeavour to increase vital people-to-people exchanges. We will work to achieve visa-free travel between all EU Member States and the United States. Together, the United States and the European Union intend to provide additional resources to increase the number of transatlantic academic exchanges. The European Union will increase its funding to the Erasmus+ programme, and will double EU support to the Fulbright-Schuman programme, and across all Fulbright Commissions in EU Member States. The United States plans to increase its funding to all Fulbright Commissions in EU Member States, including the Fulbright-Schuman programme. This collective support will significantly increase the number of transatlantic academic exchanges between our citizens over the next five years.""

"Oct 20, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-securing-the-release-united-states-citizens-taken-hostage-hamas-gaza-palestinian,"Statement on Securing the Release of United States Citizens Taken Hostage by Hamas in Gaza, Palestinian Territories","""Today we have secured the release of two Americans taken hostage by Hamas during the horrific terrorist assault against Israel on October 7. Our fellow citizens have endured a terrible ordeal these past 14 days, and I am overjoyed that they will soon be reunited with their family, who has been wracked with fear. These individuals and their family will have the full support of the United States Government as they recover and heal, and we should all respect their privacy in this moment.

From the earliest moments of this attack, we have been working around the clock to free American citizens who were taken hostage by Hamas, and we have not ceased our efforts to secure the release of those who are still being held. I thank the Government of Qatar and the Government of Israel for their partnership in this work. Jill and I have been holding close in our hearts all the families of unaccounted for Americans. And, as I told those families when I spoke with them last week, we will not stop until we get their loved ones home. As President, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans held hostage around the world.""

"Oct 20, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-president-charles-yvon-michel-the-european-council-and,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Charles Yvon Michel of the European Council and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission and an Exchange With Reporters,"""President Biden. Welcome. Madam President and Mr. President, it's great to see you both again. And our last summit, we committed to revitalizing the partnership between the EU and the United States. And over the last 2 years, we made good on that commitment, I think.
And we stood together to support the brave people of Ukraine in the face of Putin's aggression. And we stood together to tackle the economic challenges and established standards to guide our relationship with China. And we're standing together now to support Israel in the wake of Hamas's appalling terrorist attack.
And I just think that it's been one of the great pleasures of my Presidency to be able to work with both of you. And I mean that sincerely.
This morning, we're going to discuss the situation on both—the ground in both Israel and Ukraine. And I look forward to discussing how we're going to continue to seize the full potential of our partnership, including working together to drive the clean energy transition, to address unfairly traded steel and aluminum imports, to advance progress on critical mineral negotiations that's under—undergoing, and to manage a problem that also has a lot of promise as much as risk: artificial intelligence.
And so I want to thank you both for being here and for your unwavering commitment to our partnership.
And, President Michel, I'll turn it over to you.
President Michel. Thank you, dear President. Thank you for your warm welcome.
The EU and U.S., we share a special bond. We are more than close allies; we are close friends.
And I remember when you visited Brussels, you told us the moving story of your Uncle Frank, who served at the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium.
And I have also a personal story: My grandfather raised me with a strong admiration for your country, the United States, and for the sacrifices your young men and women made to liberate our part of Belgium.
Today, the world faces enormous challenges. And today, more than ever, the world needs a strong EU-U.S. alliance to tackle these challenges.
The conflict in the Middle East is a tragedy. So much suffering. So many heartbreaking images. I would like to thank you for your personal involvement, traveling to the region and working to have a positive influence.
We condemn the Hamas and its terrorist attack against Israel. Israel has the right to defend itself, and that must be done in line with international and humanitarian law.
We continue working day and night to help the most vulnerable in Palestine with their urgent needs and to foster the transition to relaunch the peace process based on a two-state solution. The EU was born as a peace project, so we continue to work tirelessly to help end the cycle of violence.
On European soil, Russia continues to rain missiles down on the people of Ukraine. And we'll stay focused on our strong support for the Ukrainian people and are grateful for American support for Ukraine. The EU, with our members states, we have provided over 82 billion euros of support, and this strong backing will continue for as long as it takes.
Finally, the U.N., the EU, and U.S., we are forging a united front to tackle all these challenges head on, working together and supporting each other. It's our—in our mutual interest, and it is good for the world. That's why we are working in the EU to try to build robust economies underpinned by robust industries that can prosper in the level playing field that we both value.
The EU and U.S., we have a powerful trade relationship. And sometimes we have our differences, but that's why we are here: to cooperate, to find solutions that work for businesses and workers on both sides of the Atlantic.
So we have a lot to discuss. We'll do it honestly, like good friends do.
Thank you.
President Biden. Well, we always have.
And by the way, I told you about my uncle who won the Purple Heart for the Battle of the Bulge and—my father's younger brother.
My father came to me after I was a Senator, and he said, ""You know""—his brother's name was Frank. And he said: ""You know, Uncle Frank never got his Purple Heart. Do you think you could find out about that?"" I was a Senator, so I found out. And sure enough, he did.
So I got a Purple Heart for him, and I invited him over to the house with the family to give it to him. He said, ""I don't want the damn thing."" I said, ""Why?"" He said: ""The others died. I didn't. I don't want it."" And an awful lot of brave people died, as well, there.
Ursula, the—Madam—[laughter]—Madam President, the floor is yours.
President von der Leyen. Thank you very much. Speaking of personal transatlantic bonds, my great-grandmother came from South Carolina, and she moved the other way around to Germany——
President Biden. You all—[inaudible]. [Laughter]
President von der Leyen. ——married my great-grandfather. And to make a longer story short, today, I am the proud mother of two American citizens. And as those citizens—American citizens—have already children again, I'm also the proud grandmother of one American citizen. So we have a lot of personal bonds that are transatlantic.
Mr. President, I want to thank you for your remarkable visit to Israel. It is important to show solidarity with Israel, victim of the worst attack since the Shoah. Israel has the right of—to self-defense in line with humanitarian law.
I was in Israel, too, exactly 1 week ago. I went to the kibbutz Kfar Aza. What I saw was barbaric. The impact on the Israeli society cannot be emphasized enough.
We stand with Israel and against terror.
At the same time, Palestinians also suffer from Hamas terroristic actions. As we have both said, Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. The United States and the European Union are both significantly increasing their humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. This is crucial, in view of their suffering.
And we must also work actively to prevent regional escalation. I am particularly concerned about Iran and its proxies. We have all seen the incidents involving missiles and drones from Yemen potentially targeting Israel. No one should take advantage of this situation.
And let me also stress: The events in the Middle East will not distract us from our rock-solid support to Ukraine. We have already provided assistance worth almost $90 billion to Ukraine. This includes financial support to keep the state and the economy running, military equipment, humanitarian aid, and support for 4 million refugees. In the next 4 years, we aim to provide another 50 billion euros. Important is for Ukraine to have predictability.
We are also making sure, through our joint actions, that Russia's ability to wage war is hampered as much as possible and that those responsible are held accountable.
Putin will ultimately fail. He is running Russia into the ground.
These conflicts show democracies must stand together. This is also true when it comes to other big challenges like fighting climate change, fostering smart investment in emerging economies, or upholding our rules-based international order.
So I'm very happy to be here today to discuss all these topics with our friend, the United States.
President Biden. We're happy to have you here——
President von der Leyen. Thank you.
President Biden. ——all of you.
Thank you, press.
Humanitarian Assistance for Gaza 
Q. Mr. President, what is happening with the trucks for Gaza? Are you confident these supplies will get into Gaza?
Q. What do you make of that, Mr. President?
Q. Mr. President, the aid for Gaza—are you confident——
Q. What do you make of that?
President Biden. I'll answer that one question and then say goodbye to all of you.
I believe you'll see that I got a commitment from the Israelis and the President of Egypt that the crossing would be open. The highway had to be repaved because it was very bad—in very bad shape. And I believe that within the next 24 to 48 hours, the first 20 trucks will come across with aid.
Thank you.""	Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Charles Yvon Michel of the European Council and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission and an Exchange With Reporters"
"Oct 20, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-reception,Remarks at a Campaign Reception,"""The President. Well, thank you very much. Look, you're all standing. I'll try to make this as short and to the point as I can.
Folks, I never quite thought of it the way my hostess just explained what she thinks about why people do what they do. You know, I was thinking as you were speaking, I was lucky. I won the gene pool. My dad was a really decent, honorable man, very well read, couldn't—got into college when he was—before the war, but could never afford to go. One of his great regrets.
But he was a well-read man, and I learned so much from him just by his example. He didn't preach much, but my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it's about your dignity. It's about whether or not you can show respect. It's about whether or not your kids are—you're going to be able to look at your kids and say, 'Honey, everything is going to be okay.'""
I remember—everybody asks why I have the position I have with regard to LGBTQ issues. I remember being—I was a young kid. I was a lifeguard when I was in high school and college, and I was working at a country club, a place that was—everybody thought that was a great deal, but I wanted to go—I was deeply involved in the civil rights movement as a kid. Our State was segregated by law.
And I remember my dad dropping me off at the city building on the way to work—his way to work—to get an application to be a lifeguard in the projects on the east side. And I was the only White employee for years there. [Laughter] No, for real. All 100 percent African American. And I just—it was a real experience.
As we were getting out of the car—many of you know Wilmington, Delaware. If you're a corporate lawyer, you know it because you know Rodney Square. [Laughter] And I was getting out at Rodney Square to go into City Hall, and there were two guys very well dressed. One—and they kissed one another, and one went to the DuPont building; one went to the Hercules building. I looked at my dad. My dad said, ""Simple."" It's the God's truth. He looked and said: ""Joey, it's simple. They love each other. They love each other."" It wasn't complicated. Not a joke.
And probably one of the best things—I never thought about it this way before until you just introduced me, but one of the best things that ever happened to me, I used to—I was a little kid in terms of stature, and I stuttered badly. T-t-tal-, talked like that.
And if you think about it, the only handicap everybody thinks they can still laugh at is stuttering. If I had said I had a club foot, no one would say, you know—and it was fixed. The point is that it made me realize everybody has something that they can't control, that's not—it's just who they are. It's just what happens. And so it taught me a lot. It taught me a lot, to have a lot of tolerance for people.
And the third thing—the fourth thing, I think, is that, you know, my mother was a—an Irish-Catholic woman who had a backbone like a ramrod. She was 5-foot-2, and you didn't screw with Jean Finnegan Biden. [Laughter]
But my mother was real simple. ""Joey, when you get knocked down, just get up."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. ""Just get up. Just get up.""
I have a picture in my office of her holding Barack's hand the night we won the Presidency and Vice Presidency. And we were out in Chicago, and my mother was—he shortly was supposed to go out on the stage for a million people, allegedly, there. And she—as we walked off out of the bandstand, my mother wasn't even supposed to go out. She was 91 years old. She grabbed Barack's hand; she said: ""Come on, honey. This is going to be okay."" [Laughter]
Come to my office, take a look. There's a picture of it, and Barack's going—[laughter].
So I guess what I'm saying is that, you know, I don't think, at least in my case, I didn't sit down and plan out my life. It was that the events—but my mom also used to say: ""Joey, you've got to be prepared to lose. You've got to be prepared to lose.""
My dad—I'm on back of my—why am I going into all of this for? But anyway. [Laughter]
My dad, I have a—I have a photograph, a cartoon in the back—on my credenza behind my desk in the White House. And you know the cartoon—I'm not a big cartoon character reader, but—Hägar the Horrible? [Laughter]
Well, my dad was at my home in Wilmington. I was about to have a fundraiser at my home when I was running for reelection for the Senate for my 97th term or whatever it was—[laughter]—and——
Audience member. Four more years! [Laughter]
The President. And what happened was, we—I built a smaller home than I had been living in because my boys were gone, and—and it was on—it's on a 10-acre pond. It's called a lake. It's not a lake; it's a 10-foot pond. It was manmade.
But—and it's—and there was about 150 acres of woods behind it owned by the DuPont company—the DuPont family. And it's a lovely setting. I don't own the lake or the background, but it's beautiful.
And my deceased wife Neilia, who was a wonderful person—no man deserves one great love, let alone two—[laughter]—he—she was raised—if any of you are familiar with Upstate New York, the Finger Lakes, she was raised in Lake Skaneateles on the lake, and she loved the lake and loved the water.
And I was standing with my dad waiting for the company to come in, and I said, ""Dad, I—you know, I wish Neilia could see this."" And she had been deceased for 20-some years at that point. And my dad said, ""Son, I'll be back in a minute.""
He drove up to the local strip shopping center to a Hallmark store. Came back with a framed copy of a cartoon with Hägar the Horrible. Two frames: one his Viking ship was knocked down, it's on rocks, and his horns on his helmet are charred, and he's looking up at God, and he's going, ""Why me?"" And the next frame, he's in the same position, and a voice from heaven says, ""Why not?"" [Laughter]
My dad was—that's it. Just deal with what you're dealt. Deal with what you're dealt. And, folks, a lot of people have been dealt tough hands. And lot of people have been dealt tough hands.
And you know, I just got back from Israel not this morning, but yesterday morning. And I don't want to repeat what you probably all heard—what I talked about—the speech I made last night and other speeches, but here's the deal——
Audience member. Amazing.
The President. I didn't mean to—but you know, I've been a really strong, strong supporter of Israel. Again, learned a lot from my dad. My dad was, as I said, a well-read man and a great—he never got to go to college; he got into Johns Hopkins. He's from Baltimore. But he could never afford to go during—the war came along, and that was it.
And—but my dad used to talk about how important it was that we—our dinner table—he'd come home from work and then go back after dinner. And he used to—our dinner table was a place where you had conversation and incidentally ate. [Laughter]
And my dad used to rail against the fact that the—that we didn't—we didn't let the Jewish ship that came in—we didn't bomb the railroad tracks on the way to the concentration camps, et cetera. And he really meant it.
What happened was when I decided that—when I got engaged, that I was going to do two things, one of which was I wanted to—my kids to understand that—the idea of silence being complicity.
It's—no, I mean—I mean this sincerely. So when they each turned 14—and we come from very modest means. We lived in a three-bedroom—we weren't poor, but three-bedroom, split-level home with four kids and a grandpop living with us. And—and so what happened was, we were—you know, my—anyway.
We got to the point where I—at age 14, my deceased son, Beau—who was the Attorney General of Delaware and volunteered to go to Iraq for a year, came back with glioblastoma because he was living near a burn pit—and his brother—younger brother Hunter, who was the wind beneath his wings, and my—and I had a little daughter who was then 18 months younger than that, and then another—and then we had another daughter Ashley, who is still alive.
And one of the things that happened was that it was one of these things where my dad used to say, ""Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end."" And what happened was that when—I got a phone call when I—I didn't plan on saying any of this, but when I got a phone call when I was—got elected when I was 29 years old to the Senate—you have to be 30, and I was—Teddy Kennedy was being—the Kennedy family has been wonderful to me.
And I was in his office hiring staff, and I wasn't old enough to be sworn in yet. [Laughter] I had to wait until the 17th—no, for real. And—and what happened was I got a phone call from my fire department in Delaware, and the poor young woman they put on the phone called and said: ""You've got to come; there's been an accident. Your family was Christmas shopping, December 18th. Your wife and three kids—there's been an accident.""
""What the matter?"" She said, ""A tractor-trailer hit them."" And I said—well, she said, ""Your wife is dead, your daughter is dead, and your two sons are not likely to make it.""
Well, you know, one of the things that—what happened is, I watched how much it mattered to me at the time, the people that embraced me that didn't know me. And there's nothing like—and you've all been through similar things that may be worse than me. But the fact is, when you have people who have been through something and they've come out and they've made it through and they talk to you, you know there's hope. They give you hope.
So there's so many people in my state that gave me hope, that embraced me. And so one of the things that I've observed is that it matters when people speak up. And I'll get this very brief amount of substance here.
I became very involved with American foreign policy. One of the reasons why Barack asked me to be Vice President, because of my foreign policy background and being chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, as well as my desire to be engaged in that.
And so I ended up spending, for example, the better part of 2 years in the Ukraine dealing with the oligarchs, the corrupt system that they had. I'm one of the few people who spoke to Rada and told them they had a chance to do something that never happened in Ukraine: establish a democratic institution and really make it work.
And so I got to know the Ukrainian people in those 2 years. In those 2 years, I probably spent a total of 3 months in Ukraine during this period of time. And so, when Putin made the move he made, some of you may remember, I predicted he was going to do it. I predicted when he was going to do it. And he did.
Over, you know, 180,000 people crossing the border, invading another country because it was part of Mother Russia. It was—never existed.
Ukraine is an example of what tyrants do when no one stands in their way. And so I was determined we had to respond. We were determined we had to respond. And we did. And we did.
And now there is a lot of discussion about whether or not it's worth it. The reason I was—made the speech I made last night was to make the case that it was essentially: If we don't, no one else will.
I spent over 180 hours—they calculated, my team—talking with the European leaders to get them to stay united. One thing Putin has agreed—was counting on from the beginning was being able to crack NATO, being able to crack the alliance so people would walk away.
And everybody asked me why do I think it's so important the United States continue to be a leader in this. We have contributed as much as all the rest of those nations combined and the GDP about the size of our population in that regard.
And guess what? Well, we've been able to slow him up, stop him. He's already lost in the sense that he cannot—can never occupy that country and successfully do it. But what he's done, I've—I'm not going to forget the mass graves and the—using rape as a weapon of war and so many other terrible things that he's done and continues to do. And if we walk away—and I met today with the European Union von der Leyen. And the—if we walk away, they—Ukraine—I mean Russia—will win.
Russia has said, within 5 days, if the United States doesn't support Ukraine, they'll go down. We probably will because the rest of the world will not sustain it, will not—we're the reason why. Not me, the United States of America is the reason why, leading the world.
We are, as Madeleine Albright said, the essential nation. We are the essential nation.
And don't worry, I'll get to Israel. [Laughter] It's no more or less important than anything else in terms of—those people are dying the same way in Ukraine. Okay?
And the reason why I'm so devoted to—and I have a reputation, as you probably know, of being maybe the most arduous supporter of Israel in the United States Congress back when the days of Jack Javits and others as well.
But here's the deal: If you think about it, what's the reason why it's so important for Israel to be sustained? Because I'm absolutely convinced—I am convinced with every fiber of my being: If there were no Israel, there's not a Jew safe in the world—not in the entire world. I really mean it. In the entire world.
[Inaudible]—including the United States, it can be counted on. So that's why I'm pushing so hard. That's why I spend so much time. But here's the other piece of it. The—I had a—I've had a long talk with—well, I won't go into it too much into detail.
But the fact is that I went over for three reasons this last time, and I've been over a lot: to meet with the war cabinet; to meet with Bibi, who I've known for over 40 years. Bibi keeps a picture, he said, on his—on his desk, a picture of he and I when I was a young Senator, and I guess I was 33 years old and he worked for the Embassy. And I wrote on the picture of the two of us standing side by side, I said: ""Bibi, I love you. I don't agree with a damn thing you say."" [Laughter]
And he reminded me of that. And that's close to true. [Laughter] But we've been friends for a long time. But here's the story.
Look, why is it that things are happening the way the way they are now? Well, I think the reason they're happening the way they are now is, I used to think when I was the chairman of Judiciary Committee coming out of the Civil—when I got Strom Thurmond to vote for the Voting Rights Act—no, I really did—[applause]—I thought you could defeat hate.
But you can never defeat hate. It just hides under a rock. When it's given oxygen, it comes back out. You've just got to keep at it. It's relentless. You cannot slow up.
And when I got elected, I made a decision, and you heard me say it. I was going to have an administration that looked like America. And I meant it. Not to be—not for political reasons, for practical reasons, to let everybody know. We have more LGBTQ people in significant spots in our administration, in the administration overall. We have more women than men in the Cabinet. We have Supreme Court Justices and others.
Now, by the way, not—we're doing this, but because we are who we are because of our diversity—because of our diversity. And everybody has to understand they have a place. Everybody has to understand they have place.
Which leads me—and, again, I'm talking too long. I had a lovely speech here. [Laughter]
But you know, one of the things that—put it this way: When America remains silent, very few other nations speak up. All kidding aside, think about it. For example, when I go around the world—and I've been to over 140-some countries—when I go around the world, you know what we talk about? We talk about the rights of LGBTQ communities.
I was in India—was in India with Gandhi's daughters talking about ""Can you do for us what you did in America; can you help us generate da, da, da?"" I mean, for real. You know that.
And the fact is that it's a matter of—let me back up. I wasn't going to run in 2000 [2020; White House correction], and—because I had just lost my son Beau, and I just didn't—I just didn't want to run. The reason I wrote the book I wrote a while ago was—""Promise me, Dad""—with my son Beau on his deathbed, he looked at me and said: ""Dad, promise me—I know you love me so much you'll quit. You'll quit. Promise me, Dad—promise me you won't disengage."" True story.
And the point is that one of the things that I remember that got me—that really made me realize that things were—had to change is—remember Charlottesville? Well, I remember in Charlottesville, watching and reading about those neo-Nazis. And they were carrying swastikas. They were chanting the same anti-Semitic bile that was chanted in Germany in the thirties. They came out of those woods carrying torches. And a young woman was killed standing—a bystander, killed by the mob.
And when the guy that is probably going to be my opponent was the President, they asked him and said, ""So what do you think?"" He said, ""There are very fine people on both sides."" [Inaudible]—has ever said anything like that—anything like that. And that's when I decided that I had to run. I mean it. I'm not being—[inaudible].
This young man asked me a profound question in the rope line—in the rope line—[laughter]—in the photo line that would take 20 minutes to answer. I said: ""Real quick: Decide what you believe in and act on what you believe in because one person can make a difference if you stand up.""
And look, we're at a place now where I see no fundamental difference between the abuse of LGBTQ rights, the abuse of—because you're Jewish or—[inaudible]—they're all—they're all the same. They're generated out of hate and fear. And the government has to speak up. The government has to speak up.
And I am—of all the terrible things that are going on, believe or not, I'm optimistic. Look, we're at an inflection point in history—literally an inflection point in history, and that is that decisions we make in the next four or five years are going to determine what the next four or five decades look like. And that's—that's a fact.
But if we each don't step up, if we walk away—if we walk away, who is going to—who is going to stay? Who is going to stay? But we also have—I want you to look at the optimistic side. If we do what I know we can do, we can change history.
For example, when I was at the G-20 in India, the 20 largest economies in the world, I got a resolution passed, an agreement passed, saying that we're going to build a railroad from New Delhi all the way up through the Middle East through the—and going into—you know, the Arab countries, from Israel, across the—not a railroad, but pipelines across the Mediterranean and then railroads—[inaudible]—to unite those countries in terms of economic stability—economic, so they all had an interest between them. We got it passed. We got it passed.
I think one of the reasons why they acted like they did, why the folks moved on the—Hamas moved on Israel as they have—is, they knew I was about to sit down with the Saudis, who are not my—I wouldn't call them the greatest democracy in the world. [Laughter]
But guess what? The Saudis wanted to recognize Israel, and they wanted—I got them to agree to overflights, and they were about to recognize Israel. And that would, in fact, unite the Middle East. We would have to pay a pretty high price—[inaudible]—that—[inaudible]—countries across from that—[inaudible]—a lot of trouble.
My point is, I think many people fear us being able to do things that unite others. And we're in a situation where we were able to do a great deal relative to—for example, in the Indo-Pacific.
I remember I was talking—my—[inaudible]—and my senior staff is really—they're very experienced. And I was going to get—I was going to be able to get Korea—South Korea and Japan to unite in helping in Europe. They didn't talk to one another. They're still fighting over the 50 years of, you know—anyway.
Well, guess what? I went to see them both. They agreed. And guess what they're doing? They're both supporting the fight in Ukraine against Russian oppression. [Inaudible]
Because they understand if they remain silent, they may be next. They may be next. What happens in Taiwan, what happens in the—what happens in the Taiwan Strait, what happens in the Indian Ocean? What happens around the world?
So I think we have an opportunity to do things, if we're bold enough and have enough confidence in ourselves, to unite the world in ways that it never has been. We were in a postwar period for 50 years where it worked pretty damn well, but that's sort of run out of steam. Sort of run out of steam. It needs a new—a new world order in a sense, like that was a world order.
So, as down as you all may be, I just think that—I think we have a real opportunity to unite the world in a way it hasn't been in a long time. And enhance the prospect of peace, not diminish the prospect of peace.
And you know, we need every American—you know, Donald Trump talks about—he tells his supporters, he says, ""I am your retribution."" This is what he says. He means it. He said: ""We're a failing nation. Either we—either they win""—meaning me—[laughter]—""or we win. If they win, we no longer have a country.""
He goes on to talk about how he has great respect for Putin, how he's a real leader, how Hamas—I mean the things he says, the—the worst part is, he basically means—if you notice all—who are his friends? All the strongmen. All the—you know, you have North Korea. You have—anyway, I won't go through it. [Laughter]
But look, here's the deal. You know, what's at stake is literally American democracy, in my view. I know when I made that speech in 2020 in Independence Hall, people thought it was hyperbole. Everybody thought that except the American people. People are worried about our democracy.
Look what they're trying to do. All the basics rights we've taken for granted for a long time, what do they want to deal with? They want to take it away. They want to take it away, whether it's to change the court system, whether it's to move in a way to deal with LGBTQ legislation, whether it's about the right to vote, just—whether it's about the right to choose. Think about all the individual things that are frontal attacks.
But that other piece of good news: This is not your father's Republican Party. [Laughter] This is a different deal. These MAGA Republicans make about 30 percent of that party, and now you saw the—the significant gentleman from Ohio, he just got his rear end kicked by—[laughter].
Audience member. Third—third time.
The President. Third—well, beyond that's the last time, because here's the deal: We have to understand that violence in American politics is never, never, never, never acceptable. Never acceptable.
But guess what? He lost the third time in the vote, then they had a secret ballot when they got back in the caucus. And I think it was something like 140 people voted against him. Because you know why they didn't publicly? Intimidated. Intimidated.
And I've had serious people talk to me about how they worry about death threats with their positions. I mean, this is the United States of America. We're so much better than that.
And, I guess, what I was to say to you is, you know, in 2024, not because of me, but because of—if Donald Trump is the nominee, if we win in 2024, we'll be an extended generation to say we saved democracy, in a way. [Inaudible]
Look—I've got to stop myself here. [Laughter]
We have to remember one thing: We're the United States of America, for God's sake. Think about it. We're the United States.
There's never been a thing we've set our mind to we haven't been able to accomplish. Not one single time in American history. No, I mean it. When we've done it together—when we've done it together.
For example—I mean, think about it. They asked me about—when I said that about 8, 10 months ago, they said, ""Well, what would you—if you could only do one thing, what would you do?"" I said I'd cure cancer. They looked at me like ""What's that about?"" because nobody thinks that anymore. The American public doesn't think that anymore.
We can. We can.
But the point is, we used to think we could do anything if we joined together and set our minds to it. Name me one crisis we ever got into where we haven't come out stronger in America. Name me one. Name me one where we went in and didn't come out stronger.
Audience member. Before you, climate change. But you fixed that. [Laughter]
The President. Well, but it's changing. That's what I'm saying. We're a hell of a lot stronger. We're a hell of a lot stronger, but there's a lot more to do.
Audience members. Thanks for the IRA.
The President. But—so, anyway. Please don't lose faith. Not—not in me. Don't lose faith—[inaudible].
And the thing that I've learned, even though I've been—I've known every major head of state in the last 40 years in my job. There's nowhere I go—[inaudible]—where I don't walk into the room and every other country—[inaudible]—stands at attention. Not because they like us, but because it's the United States of America, and they're counting on us. They're counting on us, on our strength and on our diversity.
Thank you for the help. I appreciate it very much. And I'm sorry that I rambled so much.""	Remarks at a Campaign Reception"

The opening of this essential supply route was the result of days of diplomatic engagement at the highest levels. I made it clear from the outset of this crisis—in both my public statements and private conversations—that humanitarian assistance was a critical and urgent need that had to get moving, and I express my deep personal appreciation for the leadership of President Al-Sisi of Egypt, Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, and the United Nations to allow the resumption of this assistance.
The United States remains committed to ensuring that civilians in Gaza will continue to have access to food, water, medical care, and other assistance, without diversion by Hamas. We will continue to work with all parties to keep the Rafah crossing in operation to enable the continued movement of aid that is imperative to the welfare of the people of Gaza and to continue working to protect civilians, consistent with obligations under international humanitarian law.

A Proclamation
Seventy-seven years ago, leaders from around the globe gathered for the first United Nations General Assembly. With the horrors of World War II weighing on their hearts and the hopes of humanity resting on their shoulders, they established institutions that are an enduring legacy of the progress we have made in creating a world where all people can live with dignity. This United Nations Day, we renew our commitment to sustaining and strengthening those institutions. As we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, may we live up to its fundamental promise by continuing to advance the causes of freedom, justice, and peace in the world.
We are at an inflection point in world history. From Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine and Hamas' brutal terrorist attack on Israel to the threat of climate change, we face enormous challenges to the systems our forebearers fought so hard to create. The decisions we make now will determine our course for generations to come. The United States has a duty to lead in this critical moment. We will continue to join together with international partners under a common vision for the future of the world. This means working together to accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—17 goals adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015 as a call to action and clear roadmap for people and the planet. Through the SDGs, we can advance toward a future where extreme poverty does not exist, our children do not go hungry, everyone has access to quality health care, workers are empowered, our environment is protected, entrepreneurs and innovators can access opportunity, conflicts are resolved peacefully, and countries can chart their own course. We will also continue to strengthen the United Nations' ability to end conflicts, build peace, defend human dignity, and respond to the humanitarian impacts of war. No nation can meet these challenges alone, and my Administration recognizes the critical role the United Nations plays in bringing about that vision.
Our country stands ready to continue the charge toward making that vision a reality by seeking a more secure, prosperous, and equitable world for everyone. We are working across the board to make global institutions more responsive, more effective, and more inclusive. Working closely with our international partners, we are closing global infrastructure gaps, bolstering the bonds that unite our nations, and unlocking endless opportunities that represent hope and possibility for all people. Through our Partnership for Workers' Rights, we are partnering with other United Nations member states around the world to give workers the tools they need to exercise their rights, promote a safe and decent work environment, advance a worker-centered clean energy transition, harness technology, and confront and condemn workplace discrimination in all its ugly forms. Meanwhile, we will continue working with our international partners to tackle the climate crisis and any other challenges we are confronted with.
When we stand together and recognize the common hopes that bind all humanity, we hold in our hands the power to bend the arc of history. So often, the work of the United Nations has been a reminder of those hopes, bringing us all closer together and pushing us to recognize one another as human beings worthy of dignity and respect. This United Nations Day, let us rededicate ourselves to supporting the United Nations in its mission to preserve peace, prevent conflict, and alleviate human suffering.
Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2023, as United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States, to observe United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.""	Proclamation 10657—United Nations Day, 2023"
"Oct 23, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-advanced-manufacturing-and-innovation-hubs-and-exchange-with-reporters,Remarks on Advanced Manufacturing and Innovation Hubs and an Exchange With Reporters,"""The President. Folks—Mark, thank you very much for the introduction.
Look, a little over a year ago, I signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. That act did two things. Excuse me, I have a little bit of a cold. First, it's a historic investment in bringing the semiconductor industry back to America. We invented the semiconductors, those little computer chips that are about the size of the tip of your little finger. They affect nearly everything in our lives from cell phones, to automobiles, to refrigerators, to the most sophisticated weapons systems we have.
America invented these chips. But over time, we went from producing nearly 40 percent of the world's chips down to producing just over 10 percent.
And as a result of the CHIPS and Science Act, the semiconductor companies all over the world are investing over a hundred billion dollars to bring chip production back to the United States. I've visited almost every major center, starting from South Korea on, and they want to be here, building the chips here in America.
Second, the bill created what we call ""tech hubs"" as part of the bill. A tech hub is going—we're going to invest in critical technologies, like biotechnology, critical materials [minerals; White House correction], quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing so the U.S. will lead the world again in innovation across the board. These hubs all around the country will bring together private industry, higher education, State and local governments, Tribes, and organized labor.
Today we're announcing that 31 tech hubs spread across the entire company [country; White House correction] will be able to compete for up to $75 million each to accelerate and scale up their work. And I want to thank Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Todd Young and Representative Joe—excuse me—Representatives Joe Morelle and Susan Ward—excuse me—Susan Wild for their work to make this happen.
Representatives from many of these hubs are in the—on the screen behind me. And in front of me there is—I was—that's why I was turning to look, to see whether—[laughter]—if they were still there.
The work they're doing is transformational. For example, a tech hub in Wisconsin is going to bring together research labs, medical device manufacturers, and engineers. They're going to build technology that supports personalized medicine, like tests, treatments, and therapies specifically tailored to a patient's genetic code and medical records. And I'm—I believe it's going to save a lot of lives in the long run.
Ohio—the largest concentration of rubber and plastics manufacturing in North America. In the Ohio hub, businesses and universities are going to come together to develop sustainable plastic and rubber technology that can be produced with fewer emissions and is able to be recycled and biodegradable—is biodegradable and is nontoxic, which is going to significantly impact on the environment.
These hubs are also making sure workers get the skills they need to do these jobs. For example, with the leadership of Majority Leader Schumer, a hub in Upstate New York is going to support a workforce training program for New York's semiconductor industry, which, by the way, has seen tens of billions of dollars—billions of dollars—in new investment because of the CHIPS and Science Act. This hub will have a particular focus on training people from communities historically left behind—like women, people of color—to work in the semiconductor industry.
The list goes on. We're doing this from coast to coast and in the heartland; in red States and blue States; small towns, cities of all sizes. All this is part of my strategy to invest in America and invest in Americans.
It's working. We're creating good jobs in communities all across the country, including places where, for decades, factories have been shut down, hollowed out when jobs moved overseas to find cheaper employment. Over the past few decades, these communities lost more than jobs. They lost a sense of—their sense of dignity, of opportunity, a sense of pride. We're going to change all that. Tech hubs are going to bring this work to where people live in communities all across America.
The press has started to call my plan ""Bidenomics."" [Laughter] Well, under Bidenomics, you don't have to leave home or your family to get a good job. For too long, science and innovation, and economic opportunities that came with it, were concentrated on the coasts.
As a country, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in research and development. Now it's .7 percent. How can you lead the world when you no longer lead in research and development?
My plan is changing that. Under Bidenomics, we're going to make sure America's future is made in America. You know, it's leading to a manufacturing boom attracting over $600 billion so far in private investment in American manufacturing and our clean energy future.
For too long, we looked around the world to find—corporations looked around the world to find the cheapest employment and then imported the products they made—the foreign product. Now, we're creating American jobs and exporting American products. That's good for everybody. These tech hubs will be transformational. And they're part of a long line of transformational investments we've made since I took office.
And as a result, I truly believe this country is about to take off, because, for the first time in a long time, we're investing in America, and we're investing in American people. We're investing in our future. And I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future.
I want to thank you. And I'm going to leave you now with Secretary Gina Raimondo, who has been the engine behind this effort. And she's going to lead the discussion with representatives from these tech hubs on the screen behind me for all of you to see.
I apologize. I have to go to the Situation Room. We have another issue that I have to deal with.
But thank you, thank you, thank you.
Q. Sir——
Q. Mr. President——
Pope Francis/Israel 
Q. Pope Francis spoke with you——
Q. You spoke to Pope Francis by phone yesterday?
The President. I did.
Q. How did that conversation impact you? What did you take away from it, that conversation with Pope Francis?
The President. I'll answer this one question. It—the Pope and I are on the same page. He was very, very interested in what we were doing to deal with some of the crises that we're facing, particularly in Israel this time around.
And I laid out to him what the game plan was, how we thought we should be providing the kind of assistance to Israel that it needed. And the Pope was, across the board, supportive of what we're doing.
Thank you.
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]
Q. Should Israel hold off on the—[inaudible]?
Q. Is the U.S. supporting the hostages-for-a-cease-fire deal?
Q. Why did you——
Gaza Conflict With Israel 
The President. We should get the—we should have a cease-fire—not a cease-fire, we should have those hostages released, and then we can talk.
Q. Any comment on the new hostages that were just released?
Q. Has there been any progress on that front, Mr. President?

"Oct 24, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-presenting-the-national-medal-science-and-the-national-medal-technology-and-3,Remarks on Presenting the National Medal of Science and the National Medal of Technology and Innovation and an Exchange With Reporters,"""The President. Well, welcome. And please have a seat. This is a happy occasion. We need some more happy occasions. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. And welcome to the White House, your house.
In 1921, Marie Curie visited the White House with President Warren Harding, and [he; White House correction] presented him [her; White House correction] with a precious gift: 1 gram of radium carefully stored and purchased with funds raised by thousands of American women to help continue her research that would transform everything from x rays to cancer treatment to nuclear energy.
Twenty-four years after that visit, a girl was born in Syria. She dreamt of being Madame Curie, moving to Paris, and becoming a scientist. Then a family member [friend; White House correction] with real wisdom told her—[laughter]—that: ""If you want to dream big, dream about going to America. That's where great science happens.""
We're determined to return great science to America by—we used to invest 2 percent of our GDP in—of—in science and technology. Now we invest .7 percent of our GDP.
And—but anyway, she did come to America, and her name is Dr. Akil. She's here today. Doctor, where are you? There you are. Right on the end. I'm looking—stand. Stand up so everybody can see you. Thank you.
A groundbreaking scientist studying neurobiology and emotions. We could use that badly. [Laughter] Anyway, she joined 20 other Americans receiving our Nation's highest honors in science and technology.
The National Medal of Science is given for outstanding contributions to the knowledge—to knowledge in the sciences, and the National Medal of Technology and Innovation for outstanding contributions to the promotion of technology for the improvement of the economic, environmental, and social well-being of the United States.
With this year's recipients, ""outstanding"" may be an understatement. They're extraordinary. Delivering clean drinking water and fuel-efficient heat sources to low-income countries. Growing crops that can withstand extreme weather. Deepening our knowledge of blood vessels, nerve cells [neurons; White House correction], and molecules. Pointing the way toward new treatments for diseases like cancer, Parkinson's, and addiction.
Transforming how we live, work, and communicate by being able—by helping create advanced manufacturing and expand access to the internet. Protecting our democracy by developing new technologies to protect the right to vote. Making our world more accessible by creating a next-generation wheelchair technology. Expanding—expanding—our understanding of everything from the depths of the human eye to the depths of the universe.
And they have paved the way for a generation of other scientists and innovators to pursue their own discoveries, to unlock our Nation's full potential.
To all the honorees: Thank you, thank you, thank you for your courage, for your perseverance, and maybe most importantly for your integrity.
And thank you as well to the family members and loved ones here today. I want all the family members to stand. Come on. [Applause] Thank you. I'm being a little facetious, but you know what it must have been like growing up saying, ""It's time for dinner."" And they'd say, ""What?"" [Laughter] Anyway, thank you.
I've long said America can be defined by a single word. I was in the Tibetan Plateau with Xi Jinping. I've spent a great deal of time with him one on one, back when I was Vice President and since then. And he looked at me, and he said—we just had simultaneous interpreters. And he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I said: ""I can. One word, and I mean this sincerely: possibilities. Possibilities.""
The fact that several of today's honorees immigrated from other countries is proof of the assertion that everything is possible. You know, there will be more technological change in the next 10 years, maybe in the next 5 years, than in the last 50 years. There's a—in large part to the minds sitting in front of us. And I want America to lead—to lead—that change.
Because of the greatness of a country is measured not only by the size of its economy or the strength of its military. It's—the strength of the Nation is also measured by its boldness of its science, the quality of its research, and the progress it helps bring forth for not only the country but whole the world.
In this administration, America will be the place where great science happens. You know, starting on day one, in the middle of the pandemic, we vaccinated a nation: the greatest operational effort ever undertaken by this country—operational. And we did it with a strategy based on science, not on politics. Now scientists are exploring whether the mRNA technology that brought us safe and effective COVID vaccines can be used against cancer.
I brought together some of our Nation's top minds in my Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. And I elevated the Office of Science and Technology Policy to a Cabinet-level position. It's helping to lead major initiatives on everything from artificial intelligence to ARPA-H to Advanced Research Projects Agency and Health—for Health that are going to drive breakthroughs in how we direct [detect; White House correction] and treat cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and other diseases.
And this year, we're investing $200 billion in research and development. In addition, I signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, two of the most significant investments America has ever made to supercharge research, innovation, and job creation. Already, private companies have announced over $600 billion in investments in industries from clean energy to advanced manufacturing right here in America.
Right now NASA is leading a mission on Mars. On our phones, we can see images of the red planet that before we could only dream of seeing. We are further into space than ever before, and the answer to the most fundamental question about how the universe began is not far away.
All of this and so much more has happened because America is leading the way and because the people in this room and the labs across the country are leading. It matters. It matters.
I want to close with this. Last year, I went to President Kennedy's library and museum in Boston to deliver a speech about what I referred to as the Cancer Moonshot that my wife Jill and I reignited after we got to the White House. You know, I've said before: If there's one thing I wish as President I could do, it would be ending cancer as we know it, for two reasons.
One, America began to lose faith in its ability to do anything. The one thing that would prove to Americans that we can do anything is ending cancer. There's more important things—are more—as consequential—but ending cancer.
We've never set our mind to a project we haven't accomplished if we do it together. For those who have lost, like many of us in this room, and for the ones we can save, I don't just hope we can do it, I know we can do it.
I was in that library with Kennedy's daughter Caroline, a dear friend. She presented me with her father's framed speech answering the question of why he was sending Americans to the Moon—America to the Moon.
And here's what he said in the letter. He said—President Kennedy said it was, quote, ""because the challenge is one we are unwilling—we are willing to accept and one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win.""
That's the American attitude. ""Unwilling to postpone."" We are unwilling to postpone, and we've been postponing a lot of things too long. That's all of you here today. You've been unwilling to postpone. That's America at our best.
We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we set our mind to it and do it together.
So thank you very much.
And with that, I'd like to invite the Military Aide to come up and read the citations before I present the medals.
Thank you all for being here. Thank you.
[At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Adam M. Shields, USN, Navy Aide to the President, read the citations and the President presented the medals, assisted by Lt. Col. Daniel K. DeRusha, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President.]
The President. You all are so damn impressive. [Laughter] No, I really mean it. Think of how you're literally changing the world for the better.
Thank you, everybody. And congratulations, again, to our outstanding laureates and their families.
And remember what America is all about—you do—possibilities. Possibilities. That's who we are. Anything is possible if we put our mind to it. And with you all, you've got incredible minds.
Thank you for what you've done so far. You've saved people's lives. You've changed the way we look at the world, and you made it better. I don't know that anybody could ask for anything more.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. And God bless you all.
[The President left the podium. Before exiting the room, he answered a reporter's question as follows.]
Humanitarian Assistance for Gaza 
Q. Mr. President, is humanitarian aid getting into Gaza fast enough?
The President. Not fast enough."""
"Oct 25, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-australia-building,Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia—Building an Innovation Alliance,"""We, President Biden and Prime Minister Albanese, inaugurated a new era of U.S.-Australia strategic cooperation during the Prime Minister's Official Visit and State Dinner in Washington, D.C., today.
Our nations are inseparably linked by our common democratic values and the three pillars of our alliance: defense, economic, and climate and clean energy cooperation. As our alliance cooperation reaches new heights, we are expanding our partnership into new domains to reflect the evolution of our relationship and the growing complexity of global and regional challenges. At the core of our cooperation is a shared commitment to a peaceful, open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. We reaffirm our commitment to work with Indo-Pacific partners and institutions to respond to shared challenges and ensure a region that is thriving, connected, resilient, and secure. These commitments are based on respect for international law, including as it pertains to the protection and promotion of human rights, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.
Today we announce the pursuit of new areas of cooperation on science and critical and emerging technologies so that we can build an ""Innovation Alliance."" These initiatives will augment and complement our robust economic cooperation and trade; our foundational security and defense ties; our newly inaugurated cooperation on climate, critical minerals, and clean energy; and our enduring people-to-people connections.
Steadfast in these values, we condemn in the strongest possible terms Hamas' heinous terrorist attack on Israel. The terrorist actions of Hamas can have no justification, no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned. We call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Hamas offers nothing but terror and bloodshed. It does not represent the Palestinian people, nor their legitimate needs and aspirations.
Our countries will support Israel as it defends itself and its people against such atrocities. We affirm Israel's inherent right to defend itself. In doing so, in line with the values we share as democracies, we call on all parties to act consistent with the principles of international law and to protect civilians as an utmost priority. We are concerned at the humanitarian situation in Gaza and call on all actors to ensure the provision of humanitarian supplies to populations in need.
Our two countries support equal measures of dignity, freedom, and self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians alike and we mourn every civilian life lost in this conflict. We continue to support Palestinian aspirations for a state of their own and consider a two-state solution as the best avenue towards a lasting peace.
Promoting Advanced Technology and Space Cooperation 
We welcome the announcement of a $3 billion investment in Australia by Microsoft, which will expand the company's data center and Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure in Australia over the next two years, train more than 300,000 Australians with the skills required for a cloud and AI-enabled economy, and create the Microsoft-Australian Signals Directorate Cyber Shield to harden Australia from cyber-threats to individuals, businesses, and governments. We also welcome the close partnership between the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), including bilateral cooperation through the NSF's Global Centers initiative with up to $16.3 million for climate and clean energy research, and an AI partnership supported by a combined $6.2 million in grants to drive ground-breaking research. Additionally, the development of a Memorandum of Understanding between Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Australian National University intends to strengthen cooperation in research and education between the United States and Australia.
Our focus on innovation also extends to space, where we look forward to tomorrow's signing of a space Technology Safeguards Agreement that creates the potential for new space-related commercial opportunities while providing the legal and technical framework to protect sensitive U.S. space launch technology and data in Australia consistent with our shared non-proliferation goals. We also welcome progress in negotiations of a bilateral space framework agreement, and encourage further joint commercial investment across all sectors, including space situational awareness and commercial space stations.
Building Clean Energy Supply Chains and Addressing the Climate Crisis 
In May, we launched the historic Australia-United States Climate, Critical Minerals, and Clean Energy Transformation Compact (the Compact), which affirmed our shared determination to make climate and clean energy cooperation the third pillar of our alliance and counter the threat to global security and prosperity posed by climate change. We recognize that achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement will require rapid deployment of clean energy and decarbonization technologies, and increased electrification in our countries this decade, alongside the phasedown of unabated coal power.
Under the Compact, we convened the ministerial-level United States-Australia Clean Energy Dialogue between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Australia's Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. As part of our enhanced cooperation, we plan to collaborate on clean energy supply chains with the intent to leverage our comparative advantages and sovereign capabilities, beginning with a battery supply chain working group to explore the deepening of both countries' manufacturing capability and work on battery technology research and development. We also announced our intention for a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. DOE Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and Australian entities. Australia and the U.S. DOE intend to establish the Australia-United States Clean Energy Industry Council, which will draw on the expertise of business and public finance leaders to advise our governments on clean energy industry development and cooperation.
Recognizing that climate change poses the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security, and wellbeing of people and ecosystems in the Indo-Pacific, we announce today that the United States and Australia are working to jointly develop an Indo-Pacific Net-Zero Transition bond series to mobilize funding for small-medium sized enterprises with a focus on clean energy transition.
The United States and Australia intend to work to enhance access to the resources of the Green Climate Fund, and other relevant multilateral funds, especially for those most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). This effort will be advanced, including through targeted bilateral technical assistance from USAID to LDCs and SIDS, and in coordination with DFAT's program of support to Pacific Island countries
Recognizing the central role of critical minerals in the clean energy transformation, we also applaud the successful launch of the U.S.-Australia Critical Minerals Taskforce, led by the U.S. National Security Council in partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce, and Australia's Department of Industry, Science and Resources. Leveraging the growing economic connections between both countries, the Taskforce identified areas in which the U.S. and Australian Governments can take joint action to increase investment in critical minerals mining and processing projects in our respective countries and enhance market transparency in this sector. A new Memorandum of Understanding between CSIRO and the United States Geological Survey around critical minerals aims to deepen relationships between U.S. and Australian researchers, including on minerals processing.
Prime Minister Albanese reiterated his support for President Biden's request of Congress to add Australia as a ""domestic source"" within the meaning of Title III of the U.S. Defense Production Act, which would streamline technological and industrial base collaboration and build new opportunities for United States investment in the production and purchase of Australian critical minerals, critical technologies, and other strategic sectors. Taken together, these initiatives will further our efforts to build more diverse and resilient supply chains.
Recognizing the imperative to address non-CO2 pollutants as a key driver of global climate change, we intend to continue to take strong action at home on methane mitigation and consider opportunities to support developing countries in the Indo-Pacific with capacity building assistance on methane mitigation. The United States commends Australia's robust action underway at home to address all greenhouse gases, including methane, as demonstrated in its comprehensive reporting of its climate policies and measures in its upcoming climate change statement. Under the Climate Compact, we plan to strengthen our cooperation on non-CO2 gases in the coming years. Together, we are committed to supporting the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund's work to enhance support for early action to reduce HFC consumption and for improved energy efficiency for the HCFC phase-out and HFC phase-down in order to maximize the climate benefits of Montreal Protocol implementation.
Advancing Prosperity and Resilience in the Pacific and Southeast Asia 
We are working through existing regional architecture, including the Pacific Islands Forum as the pre-eminent institution for Pacific Island Countries, to help the region meet its needs and aspirations, including as articulated in the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. Australia welcomes the U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit held in Washington, D.C. last month. Signifying that commitment, today we announce that the United States and Australia plan to co finance critical maritime infrastructure projects in Kiribati, including the rehabilitation of Kanton Wharf and Charlie Wharf in Tarawa.
The U.S. Government, working with the U.S. Congress, and Australia through the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific, intend to provide $65 million to finance future submarine cable connectivity for Pacific Island countries, to assist access to global markets and realization of regional connectivity goals. We plan to work collaboratively with commercial cable providers Google and Hawaiki Nui, in partnership with Pacific Island countries, to provide branching units for Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Building on existing support to the region, this work will position all Pacific Island countries to achieve primary connectivity and for countries with existing access to secure options for critical redundancy.
Together, the United States and Australia will engage Pacific Island nations to develop and deploy a pilot initiative in the region to increase national cyber resilience, to include upgraded data services and cloud-based back-ups. Australia also welcomes the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) announcement at the U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit to launch an up to $50 million Pacific Islands Microfinance Partnership that would facilitate lending for small businesses in the Pacific Islands region.
The United States and Australia remain committed to evolving multilateral development banks to better address global challenges as part of their contribution to reducing poverty, boosting sustainable and inclusive growth, and helping achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We commit to raising the level of ambition to deliver more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank's capacity to support low- and middle-income countries in addressing global challenges and to provide strong support for the poorest countries. The United States and Australia will step up efforts to this end. Both countries continue to cooperate through the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to promote transparent, high-quality investment, including use of competitive procurement focused on value for money and strong development outcomes, that creates more opportunities for local employment and skills development across the Indo-Pacific, particularly the Pacific Islands.
We also remain committed to working with Pacific Island countries to maintain access to enduring banking services. Today, we jointly launch a new Pacific Banking Forum, in consultation with Pacific Island countries, to bring together our public and private sectors to address the causes of de-risking, and we affirm our plan to provide new and additional technical assistance to improve the region's access to financial services. We further intend to work with the Pacific to address the costs and accessibility of correspondent banking relationships, including by addressing jurisdiction-specific challenges and exploring regional approaches to aggregate payment flows, as appropriate.
Australia welcomes the United States Coast Guard's decision to forward deploy a cutter to the Pacific in early 2024 to provide an increased presence and support regional organizations to address maritime security priorities, including illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. Australia plans to support the Coast Guard's increased regional presence through logistical support during its periodic deployments to the region.
Recognizing the importance of greater cultural, business, and educational exchanges with the Indo-Pacific, the United States welcomes Australia's establishment of a new Pacific Engagement Visa, to respond directly to requests from Pacific Island countries and Timor-Leste for access to Australia.
We reiterate our enduring commitment to deepen our respective engagement with Southeast Asia. As Comprehensive Strategic Partners of ASEAN, we reaffirm our commitment to ASEAN centrality and ASEAN-led regional architecture, and to supporting the implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We express our gratitude for Indonesia's leadership of ASEAN during its 2023 ASEAN Chair year, including the East Asia Summit, and commit to support Laos as ASEAN Chair in 2024.
We also commit to work together, and with like-minded partners, to support Southeast Asia's economic, development, and security priorities. We resolved to align implementation of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and Invested: Australia's Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040 to boost investment in energy transition and other strategic sectors and build supply chain resilience. The United States and Australia also plan to support cooperation with regional countries to promote a fair, open, inclusive, and sustainable digital economy. Recognizing the importance of regional food security, the U.S. and Australia plan to support ASEAN's efforts to build long-term resilient, inclusive, and sustainable agrifood systems, including through strengthening regional agricultural research and development. We look forward to furthering joint cooperation in Southeast Asia with regional partners, including Japan and the Republic of Korea.
Enhancing Defense and Security Cooperation 
Recognizing the historic and strategically significant defense announcements made at AUSMIN 2023, we welcome the progress on the delivery of our ambitious trajectory for Enhanced Force Posture Cooperation, including the rotation of U.S. Army Watercraft in Australia commencing in July, and scoping of upgrades at key Australian bases in the north. We also welcome the completion of a new fuel facility at RAAF Base Darwin in support of Enhanced Air Cooperation between the United States and Australia. We strongly endorse the work under way to establish guided weapons co-production, as a first step towards higher volumes of industrial production for the alliance. We applaud the implementation of the Australia-Japan Reciprocal Access Agreement, which has already deepened exercise collaboration and capabilities integration, paving the way for Australia's first ever participation in Exercises YAMA SAKURA and KEEN EDGE in Japan. Today, we announce our intention to explore trilateral cooperation with Japan on Unmanned Aerial Systems. Our cooperation aims to enhance interoperability and accelerate technology transfer in the rapidly emerging field of collaborative combat aircraft and autonomy.
We also affirm our commitment to bilateral cooperation on collaborative combat aircraft. Our cooperation will enhance interoperability and accelerate technology transfer in the rapidly emerging field of Unmanned Aerial Systems. In addition, Australia welcomes the U.S. decision to acquire the E-7A Wedgetail, and continued U.S. cooperation with Australia to ensure we can jointly develop and operate advanced military capabilities.
We note the substantial progress being made to support Australia's acquisition of conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines through the trilateral AUKUS partnership while ensuring that these activities set the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard and are consistent with the partners' international and domestic obligations and commitments. Since we stood together in San Diego and announced the pathway for Australia to acquire conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines (SSNs) in March, the first Australian military personnel have graduated from U.S. nuclear power school, and the U.S.S. North Carolina has completed the first SSN port visit to Australia in support of AUKUS. We also strongly support our deepened cooperation on advanced capabilities under AUKUS. We continue to make progress across our current capability development programs, including holding the first demonstration of AUKUS artificial intelligence and autonomous capabilities. As our work progresses on these and other defense and security capabilities, we will seek opportunities to engage allies and close partners. Our efforts through AUKUS are one of the many ways we are working together to deter aggression and support a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable.
We welcome the momentum and significant steps underway to streamline defense trade controls and information sharing between our nations, as part of our shared commitment to maximizing the strategic and technological advantage of the Alliance and to maximize the full potential of AUKUS. Australia acknowledges the U.S. Administration's significant steps in this regard, including the Biden Administration's bold proposal to Congress that would transform export controls laws. Australia is also examining its export controls framework to streamline the flow of defense information and technology and is taking steps to realize this ambition. Collectively these actions are designed to enhance and expedite collaboration between and among AUKUS partners to help us maintain our capability edge, while strengthening our ability to protect the sensitive technologies that underpin our security. Furthermore, we reiterate our joint commitment to strengthening security standards to safeguard sensitive technology and information.
We also affirm the importance of strengthening our cyber security in response to increasing global threats. The United States and Australia have a shared interest in promoting a safer and more secure cyberspace bilaterally and in multilateral forums, including with the Partners in the Blue Pacific, the Quad, and the International Counter Ransomware Initiative.
At AUSMIN 2011, both governments recognized that in the event of a cyberattack that threatens the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of either of our nations, under the ANZUS Treaty, the United States and Australia would consult together and determine appropriate options to address the threat. Today, we reaffirm that international law applies in cyberspace and that a cyberattack on our nations could constitute an armed attack under Article IV of the ANZUS Treaty. A decision as to when such a cyberattack would lead to the invocation of Article IV would be made on a case-by-case basis through close consultations between the United States and Australia.
We affirm that States should take appropriate measures to ensure the responsible development, deployment, and use of their military AI capabilities, including those enabling autonomous functions and systems.
Strengthening our Economic Security and Resilience 
We affirm our intention to continue increasing cooperation to build our shared economic security and resilience, including by promoting open, fair, and rules-based trade, countering non-market policies and practices, and deterring and addressing economic coercion. We intend to increase our cooperation to address these practices, including with other partners and allies.
As we strengthen and integrate our innovation ecosystems, we have a shared interest in enhancing our technology protection toolkits to ensure sensitive advanced technologies critical to military modernization cannot be used to undermine international peace and security. Australia acknowledges the strategic rationale of the U.S. Executive Order to advance a targeted set of controls on outbound investments in sensitive technologies with a core national security nexus. Australia regularly reviews its investment settings to ensure they remain fit for purpose to deal with emerging risks. We intend to maintain close consultations and communicate clearly to the private sector regarding our joint resolve and shared objectives in this area, including our long-standing commitment to investment and open and fair trade.
The United States and Australia have a deep and long-standing trade and investment relationship, underpinned by the Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. We continue to work together to promote diversified supply chains and fair and open, rules-based trade. We share a commitment to the rules-based multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core. We continue to work together to reform the WTO so that it is better equipped to achieve its foundational objectives and address modern day challenges, and remain committed to conducting discussions with a view to having a fully- and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all members by 2024. We look forward to a successful Thirteenth WTO Ministerial Conference and will continue to work constructively to ensure positive outcomes, including on reform issues.
We are committed to delivering strong outcomes on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). Together with other IPEF partners, the United States and Australia are tackling new and emerging economic challenges, including by strengthening trade connectivity and regional supply chains, unlocking green trade and investment to support the clean energy transition, accelerating anti-corruption, and enhancing tax cooperation efforts in the region.
Throughout the U.S. host year of APEC, we continue to advance a free, fair, and open economic policy agenda that empowers our workers and benefits all our people. We look forward to a successful APEC Economic Leaders' Week next month in San Francisco, which will make further progress towards a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future for us all.
Promoting Global and Regional Peace and Stability 
We are committed to upholding a global order underpinned by international rules and norms, with the United Nations (UN) at its heart. The United States and Australia are steadfast in their commitment to upholding international law, including the United Nations Charter and call for all countries to uphold its purposes, principles, and obligations arising under the Charter, including refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.
We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia's illegal and unprovoked war against Ukraine. Russia's war violates international law, including the UN Charter, and is driving global food and energy insecurity. We once again call on Russia to immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw its forces from within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. The United States and Australia are committed to supporting Ukraine to empower it to resolve this conflict on its own terms.
In addition to support to Ukraine, Australia responded to a request from the United States to deploy a Royal Australian Air Force E-7A Wedgetail aircraft to Germany, which starts operations this week. The Australian deployment will bolster the multilayered protection of the international flow of assistance to Ukraine by providing early warning of a threat against the gateway of assistance. The United States also welcomes Australia's recent announcement that it will provide an additional $13 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including counter-drone and demining equipment.
Furthermore, we reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We strongly condemn the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) unprecedented number of ballistic missile launches, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missile launches, that pose a grave threat to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. We reiterate our commitment to the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime and its cornerstone, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We reaffirm our commitment to practical efforts to reduce nuclear risks and to the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons.
We reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the Quad and its shared vision of an open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. We will continue to deliver on the Quad's positive and practical agenda, guided by the priorities of regional countries and responding to the regions' needs. We reiterate the Quad's unwavering support and respect for regional institutions, including ASEAN, PIF, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association. The United States applauds the success of Australia hosting the 2023 Quad Leaders' Summit in Hiroshima and we look forward to the next Quad Leaders' Summit being held in India.
We emphasize the importance of all States being able to exercise rights and freedoms in a manner consistent with international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), including freedom of navigation and overflight. We strongly oppose destabilizing actions in the South China Sea, such as unsafe encounters at sea and in the air, the militarization of disputed features, the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia, including to interfere with routine Philippines maritime operations around Second Thomas Shoal, and efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation. We also recognize that the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award is final and legally binding on the parties in that proceeding, and we are concerned about China's excessive maritime claims that are inconsistent with international law, as well as unilateral actions that may raise tensions and increase the risk of miscalculation in the region. We resolve to work with partners to support regional maritime security and uphold international law.
We reaffirm the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and our shared opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo. We call for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues through dialogue without the threat or use of force or coercion.
We emphasize the importance for all countries of promoting open channels of communication and practical measures to reduce the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation and to prevent conflict in the Indo-Pacific.
Strengthening People-to-People Ties 
We acknowledge the richly diverse cultures of Indigenous Peoples in the United States and Australia, and both Governments reiterate our commitment to working in partnership with Native Hawaiians, Native American Tribes, and First Nations Peoples.
The United States and Australia have a shared interest in ensuring that our trade and investment agenda delivers inclusive economic growth and benefits for everyone. Today we have also committed to work together, and in genuine partnership with Indigenous businesses and stakeholders from both the United States and Australia, to grow opportunities for our Indigenous Peoples to enjoy the economic prosperity created by our two-way trade and investment. We welcome the opportunities that will be created by the U.S. announcement of new funding that will work with Australian government programs to support ongoing dialogue, knowledge-sharing, and increased business opportunities for our Indigenous Peoples over the coming months and years.
The United States is pleased to begin initial discussions with its international partners, including Australia, to explore a U.S. Transportation Security Administration ""One Stop Security"" pilot program. ""One Stop Security"" would streamline security screening requirements and shorten transit times for covered passenger populations. We appreciate Australia's interest in this pilot opportunity and look forward to continuing conversations based on security commensurability.
We reaffirm our commitment to gender equality, including through achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5, promoting women's leadership, and advancing women's economic empowerment globally, as well as countering efforts to push back against women's and girls' human rights. We emphasize the importance of working with partners to combat all forms of gender-based violence—online and offline—and fully implement the Women, Peace and Security agenda, especially in the Indo-Pacific. We commit to reinforce this coordination through our annual bilateral strategic dialogue on gender equality and as founding members of the Women in the Sustainable Economy Initiative. We also recommit to working together to promote children's online safety, including through strengthening bilateral coordination to advance awareness, prevention, and response to child sexual exploitation and abuse online.
This visit serves to reaffirm the commitment of the United States and Australia to build on our existing cooperation to enhance an Innovation Alliance that will benefit our two countries and the entire Indo-Pacific."""
"Oct 25, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-election-j-michael-johnson-speaker-the-house-representatives,Statement on the Election of J. Michael Johnson as Speaker of the House of Representatives,"""Jill and I congratulate Speaker Johnson on his election. As I said when this process began, whoever the Speaker is, I will seek to work with them in good faith on behalf of the American people.
That's a principle I have always held to, and that I've acted on: delivering major bipartisan legislation on infrastructure, outcompeting China, gun reform, and veterans care.
I restated my willingness to continue working across the aisle after Republicans won the majority in the House last year. By the same token, the American people have made clear that they expect House Republicans to work with me and with Senate Democrats to govern across the aisle: to protect our urgent national security interests and grow our economy for the middle class.
While House Republicans spent the last 22 days determining who would lead their conference, I have worked on those pressing issues, proposing a historic supplemental funding package that advances our bipartisan national security interests in Israel and Ukraine, secures our border, and invests in the American people. These priorities have been endorsed by leaders in both parties.
We need to move swiftly to address our national security needs and to avoid a shutdown in 22 days.
Even though we have real disagreements about important issues, there should be mutual effort to find common ground wherever we can. This is a time for all of us to act responsibly, and to put the good of the American people and the everyday priorities of American families above any partisanship.""	Statement on the Election of J.

"Oct 25, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-welcoming-ceremony-for-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-australia,Remarks at a Welcoming Ceremony for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia,"""President Biden. Well, Mr. Prime Minister and Jodie, distinguished guests, and all of Australia out on the lawn—[laughter]—welcome. Welcome and good morning—or, as you would say, g'day.
You know, it's an honor to welcome you all to the White House as we celebrate the enduring alliance between Australia and the United States, an alliance that's marked by imagination, ingenuity, and innovation.
Nearly 55 years ago, American astronauts took humanity's first step on the Moon. They sent a message, forever etched in history, quote, ""That's one small step for man, [and] one giant step [leap; White House correction] for mankind.""
But the only reason anyone down on Earth saw this feat or heard those immortal words was thanks to a team of Australian engineers. As dawn broke at NASA station, just outside of Canberra, they aimed a radio telescope toward the heavens, captured a lone vote—lone voice among all the stars, and shared it with millions of people watching breathlessly all around the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Prime Minister, today, Australia and the United States continue to stand together, continue to innovate, to push pact [past; White House correction] the bounds that had been in our way, and make a giant step toward what could be, to race undaunted toward a future we know is possible if—if—we work together.
Because time and time again, we've seen what America and Australia can do when we stand as one.
We saw it during World War I, when our troops helped turn the tide of war on the Western Front. We saw it during World War II, when we fought the forces of fascism, side by side in the Pacific, cementing a mateship between our people. And we saw it again during the war against terror, when Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty for the first time to stand with the United States after we were attacked on 9/11.
And we'll never forget those brave Australians and Americans who, generation after generation, gave their lives to give us a better world. We'll never forget our obligation to them to keep upholding the democratic values for which they gave their lives, to keep forging a better future for generations to come.
Together, Australia and America are meeting that obligation. As two proud Pacific nations, we're ensuring the Indo-Pacific remains free, open, and prosperous and secure, including through our historic AUKUS partnership with the United Kingdom. We're building stronger economies, economies where no one fears coercion and everyone, as you say Down Under, gets a fair go.
Together, we're standing with Israel against Hamas's terrorism. We're standing with Ukraine against Putin's tyranny. And we're providing and—proving that democracy can deliver on the challenges that matter most to people's lives, from climate change to cancer.
And today, we're fueling the spark of innovation that has long burned in the hearts of Aussies and Americans. Innovation that will help uplift people in Indo-Pacific and all around the world. Innovation that took us to the Moon and will take us further in the years ahead.
Mr. Prime Minister, the alliance between Australia and the United States has never been more important than it is today. And we have never been more committed than we are today.
Australia and America stand ready. Ready to do the hard work, the historic work, to tackle the challenges we face. Ready to take a giant leap together toward a better future, one of greater opportunity, dignity, security, and liberty for Americans, for Australians, for all.
May God bless our alliance, and may God protect our troops.
And now it's my great honor to introduce Prime Minister Albanese, and I'm honored to invite you to say a few words. Thank you.
Prime Minister Albanese. President Biden, First Lady Dr. Biden, firstly, thank you for the great honor of this invitation and the wonderful warmth of your welcome, including the wonderful dinner we had in the White House last night.
Mr. President, when you and I stood together in San Diego in March, the USS Sterett and the USS Missouri behind us, we were surrounded by the examples of America's power. To stand with you here in Washington, DC, is to witness the power of America's example: the ideas and ideals that your great democracy was built on.
The self-evident truths that every American generation strives to give deeper meaning and the peace and freedom that America seeks to defend around the globe. The principle that every country, large and small, should be able to seek to shape its own destiny and secure its own future, where the sovereignty of every nation is respected and the dignity and liberty of every individual is recognized. Where peace is secured not by fear of force or strength of arms alone, but through the collective commitment and the shared responsibility of the international community.
This is at the heart of our alliance, the soul of our partnership: not a pact against a common enemy, a pledge to a common cause; a shared belief that freedom, peace, and equality are not just American ideals or Australian values, they belong to all humankind.
That is why Ukrainian soldiers are driving Australia-made Bushmasters as they drive back an illegal and immoral invasion. And it is why all Australians condemn the atrocities, terror, and pitiless brutality of Hamas.
And, Mr. President, we applaud the personal resolve you have brought to this troubled part of the world. You have spoken with moral clarity. And you have stood up for a simple principle: the principle that every innocent life matters—Israeli and Palestinian—and that in every conflict, every effort must be made to protect civilians.
American leadership is indispensable, but it is not inevitable. It takes a leader to deliver it. It takes wisdom to show empathy, courage to provide humanitarian assistance, and true leadership to seek peace. Because protecting innocent people is not a show of weakness, it is a measure of strength.
Mr. President, our nations' steadfast alliance has grown and thrived through 15 of my predecessors and 13 of yours. In Australian public life, it meets the number-one measure of a great idea: Both political parties try and claim credit for it. [Laughter] But it is not and it has never been the leaders at this podium who determine the strength and success of our alliance. It is the people we serve.
Presidents and Prime Ministers can praise our countries' shared values. We can sign agreements to advance our common interests. But it is our citizens who make the words a bond. It is our people whose courage and ambition, hard work and aspiration give life and weight to all we share and all we strive for.
Sometimes, we casually refer to ""average Americans"" or ""everyday Australians,"" but what they do every day is anything but average. It is our people making the breakthroughs that are seeing Australia and the United States cooperate in new technology like never before, from quantum computing and medical science, to agriculture and defense. It's our people driving unprecedented collaboration in our creative industries, in art and film and music, from ""Barbie"" to ""Bluey."" [Laughter]
It is our people partnering to unlock the possibilities of clean energy and critical minerals. The third pillar—the new pillar—of our alliance: a plan for both our nations to seize the transformative economic opportunities of clean energy and a plan to help every nation meet the global challenge of climate change.
It is our people who will train together, side by side, to service the next generation of our submarines and defense technology. And it is our people that we honor when we remember the generations of Australians and Americans who have fought and fallen together, our veterans and all those who have given the cause of peace their last full measure of devotion.
And, Mr. President, in reflecting on this century of service, I'm reminded of a sentiment that you have shared before from an American soldier talking about his time in Iraq. And that sentiment was this, ""You know when there's an Australian with you, they'll always have your back."" A generous thought from a man of courage and character, Major Beau Biden.
Mr. President, you have known far more than life's ordinary share of loss and grief, and you have been called to serve at a time when sadness and strife have cast a long shadow on our world. You understand that the task for all of us is to draw on the strength that hope instills, to look to the future not just with optimism for better days, but with the determination to build a better world.
And while we do indeed face testing times, our friendship is tried and tested. Our people are up for the challenge. Our alliance has been shaped by history, and it is ready to shape the future. So, with optimism and with determination, let us pledge to make this is a time when ""hope and history rhyme.""
Let us write the next chapter in our alliance together.
I thank you, Mr. President.""	Remarks at a Welcoming Ceremony for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia"
"Oct 25, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-australia,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia,"""President Biden. Well, Mr. Prime Minister, welcome. Welcome to the White House, welcome to the Oval Office. It's been a long time in coming.
And I—well, let me apologize again for not being able to make my visit to Australia. Things were a little bit in disarray here and required to be home. And so that's why I didn't. But I'm delighted you're here.
And together, you know, we've worked together to really strengthen the alliance, and I think we've actually deepened that strength. I think we've moved in a direction that—through our historic AUKUS partnership with the United Kingdom, and we've expanded economic involvement with one another, with American investment in Australia being at an alltime high under our administration.
And in May, we strengthened our climate ties—and thank you, thank you, thank you for your move on climate; it's a big deal—including launching a new climate, minerals, and clean energy compact, because you have great assets that we can all use to make sure that we move in the direction of clean energy. And today we're taking our alliance even further with doubling down on cooperation on technology and science.
This morning we're going to discuss how all these efforts can help advance a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific. And I look forward to discussing how we can work together to address threats to the stability in the region and the economic stability as well, supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia's bitter aggression, and to stand with Israel in the wake of Hamas's appalling terrorist attacks.
So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for being here. It's an honor to have you. And thank you for your leadership and your personal friendship.
Prime Minister Albanese. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. It is a great honor for me to be here as Australia's Prime Minister.
And our alliance, I believe, has never been more important, and it's also never been stronger. We've added a third tier. We have had defense, and we've had the economic relationship—defense through ANZUS, the economic relationship through our free trade agreement.
But we've added a third part of this alliance front and center as well through our clean energy, critical minerals, and climate change compact, taking action to protect the world, to lower emissions, to take advantage of the shift to clean energy that—the opportunity that presents to grow economies as well and to decouple—particularly for developing nations—to allow them to develop in a way at the same time as they're reducing emissions. And breaking that nexus between industrialization and emissions is so important.
The AUKUS agreement is so central. And I thank you, Mr. President, for the work that you've done in persuading legislators to make sure that we put in place the measures that are necessary to encourage that two-way transfer of defense technology that will be at the center of an agreement that's about peace and security in our region, but also about prosperity in our region as well.
In addition to that, the work that we're doing together in the Pacific is very important. And I know that you've hosted Pacific leaders twice here in the White House, and that has been very welcome.
In today's uncertain world, the alliance between Australia and the United States and the way that we stand steadfast against aggression, whether it be Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine or whether it be Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel, is something that can be relied upon for us to stand up for our common values.
And that's why I very much welcome this visit and welcome the cooperation that we're having, as well as our personal relationship. This is our ninth meeting in just the 16 months that I've had the honor of being Prime Minister, and I look forward to continuing to take the relationship to a higher level, as we do every time we meet.
Today we'll be advancing a technology agreement between our two great nations as well. And innovation is so important—that we're able to commercialize it to benefit both of our peoples.
I thank you.
President Biden. Well, you've made one member of my administration incredibly happy with your strong move toward environmental protection. That's Secretary Kerry.
Prime Minister Albanese. Indeed. [Laughter] Indeed. And he's shown great leadership, of course.
President Biden. Well, he is. He's really——
Prime Minister Albanese. And it is so important for us.
The other area of our cooperation is, of course, in working on natural disasters. Later, I'll be visiting your emergency management authority. We've set up a similar model nationally based upon what you've done here, because climate change is real, and we can see its impacts with wildfires, with floods.
And that is just a reminder every time that we have a responsibility to this and future generations.
President Biden. Well, I was asked by Xi Jinping a couple years ago why I was working so hard with your country. And I said, ""Because we're a Pacific nation."" He looked at me, and I said, ""Yes, we're a Pacific nation—the United States."" We are, and we're going to stay that way.
So thank you. Thank you, everyone.
Prime Minister Albanese. Certainly.
Thank you.
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]
Q. Mr. President, on Israel, will you respond to attacks on U.S. troops in the region? Will you respond to attacks on U.S. troops in the region, Mr. President?
President Biden. Whoa, whoa, whoa—well, you're going to get—we're going to have a press conference after this. We'll be able to answer your questions.
Thank you.""	Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia"
"Oct 25, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-australia,The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia,"""President Biden. The sun is over there.
[At this point, President Biden removed his sunglasses.]
I don't need these. [Laughter]
Hello, folks.
Mr. Prime Minister, we've been in close touch since the moment you came into office—please, sit down; I'm sorry—since you came into office, and we've met all around the world. And now it's wonderful to have you by my side here at the White House and—as we advance our alliance even more than it's already been advanced. It's strong now; it's getting stronger.
Before I get to the progress Australia and the United States have made today, I want to say just a very few words about the situation in the Middle East.
The anger, the hurt, the sense of outrage that the Israeli people are feeling after the brutally inflicted devastation by Hamas is completely understandable. Israel has the right and, I would add, a responsibility to respond to the slaughter of their people. And we will ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself against these terrorists. That's a guarantee.
We also have to remember that Hamas does not represent—let me say it again—Hamas does not represent the vast majority of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip or anywhere else. Hamas is hiding behind Palestinian civilians, and it's despicable and, not surprisingly, cowardly as well.
This also puts an added burden on Israel while they go after Hamas. But that does not lessen the need for—to operate and align with the laws of war for Israeli—it has to do everything in its power—Israel has to do everything in its power, as difficult as it is, to protect innocent civilians. And it's difficult.
I want to thank the Israeli—the Israelis and the Palestinian—excuse me, and President Sisi of Egypt for working with the United States to make sure that food, water, and medical supplies are getting through to innocent people in Gaza. The flow needs to increase, and we're working very hard with our partners to make that happen.
We're also working around the clock, together with our partners in the region, to secure the release of hostages and—including American citizens behind—left behind and held by Hamas and the safe passage of foreign nationals out of Gaza, not just Americans, but Australians and a whole range of people who are trapped in Gaza.
I also want to take a moment to look ahead toward the future that we seek. Israelis and Palestinians equally deserve to live side by side in safety, dignity, and peace. And there's no going back to the status quo as it stood on October the 6th. That means ensuring Hamas can no longer terrorize Israel and use Palestinian civilians as human shields.
It also means that when this crisis is over, there has to be a vision of what comes next. And in our view, it has to be a two-state solution. It means a concentrated effort from all the parties—Israelis, Palestinians, regional partners, global leaders—to put us on a path toward peace.
In the past few weeks, I've spoken with leaders throughout the region—including King Abdullah of Jordan, President Sisi of Egypt, President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, and just yesterday with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia—about making sure there's real hope in the region for a better future; about the need—and I mean this sincerely—about the need to work toward a greater integration for Israel while insisting that the aspirations of the Palestinian people will be part—will be part—of that future as well.
I'm convinced one of the reasons Hamas attacked when they did—and I have no proof of this; just my instinct tells me—is because of the progress we were making towards regional integration for Israel and regional integration overall. And we can't leave that work behind.
And one more word on this. I continue to be alarmed about extremist settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank that—pouring gasoline on fire is what it's like. They—this was the deal. The deal was made, and they're attacking Palestinians in places that they're entitled to be, and it has to stop. They have to be held accountable. And it has to stop now.
Prime Minister—Mr. Prime Minister, I want to thank you for your partnership and your friendship, quite frankly, during this difficult hour.
Over the past few weeks and for many months before, we've seen each other, and we've seen our alliance grow more critical than ever. And we need to make—we continue to make this important progress. In our discussions today, we've done just that.
First, we're pioneering new advancements in innovation that is deepening our cooperation in fields like biotechnology, advanced batteries, quantum computing, cybersecurity, and a lot more.
We're also signing a new technology safeguards agreement to create more opportunities for American space companies to launch vehicles from Australia.
And we've launched a new artificial intelligence initiative between our national laboratories to drive revolutionary and responsible research on humanity's biggest challenges: fighting hunger, curbing pandemics, predicting natural disasters, and ending cancer as we know it—as a matter of a fact, both of our wives are over at the Cancer Institute right now—and so much more.
Second, we're accelerating action on climate change. And I thought we had a very good meeting this morning and—with Secretary Kerry and your team, and we're all together on that. In May, we established the Climate, Critical Minerals, and Clean Energy Compact to elevate our climate cooperation alongside our defense and economic cooperation, and we're already beginning to see the impacts. We've created a Critical Minerals Task Force to build secure critical minerals supply chains.
We're also investing in sustainable infrastructure in the Pacific Islands, including $65 million for a subsea communication cable to boost connectivity in the region. And we're modernizing funding for small and medium-sized businesses across the Indo-Pacific to help the transition to clean energy.
And finally, our alliance, the alliance between Australia and the United States, is an anchor—and I believe this from every fiber of my being—an anchor to peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and, quite frankly, around the world.
We see this through our work of the Quad partners—India and Japan—to ensure the Indo-Pacific remains free, open, prosperous, and secure. I also see it through AUKUS, where, together with the United Kingdom, we're making a generational investments in our shared security.
Last week, I sent Congress a budget request with commitments to boost our submarine production and maintenance capacity here in the United States. And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the historic investments Australia has made to strengthen the submarine industry base as well.
Democrats and Republicans alike understand the strategic value AUKUS brings to our nations, and I urge Congress—I urge Congress—to pass our AUKUS legislation this year.
We also see the strength of our alliance in our unwavering support for Ukraine—both countries—as it defends its sovereignty against Putin's brutality and aggression. Australia is a critical partner together with the United States and 50 other nations—50 other nations we've been able to put together—all doing our part to support Ukraine.
And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the new package of military aid you recently announced, and I—it's for Ukraine.
Look, Australia and the United States also share, in my view, the commitment to upholding the international rules of the road, including freedom of navigation. Just this past week, the P.R.C. vessels acted dangerously and unlawfully as our Philippine friends conducted a routine resupply mission within their own—their own—exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.
I want to be clear—I want to be very clear: The United States defense commitment to the Philippines is ironclad. The United States defense agreement to the Philippines is ironclad. Any attack on the Filipino aircraft, vessels, or Armed Forces will invoke a mutual—our Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines.
And, Mr. Prime Minister, today we renewed our commitment to defend the values that are at the heart of this alliance, and we continue to stand as one to forge a better future for both of us and all the region.
So I want to thank you, again, for being here. Thank you for your partnership and your leadership in this critical moment.
And I'd like to now turn it over to you.
Prime Minister Albanese. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.
Australia and the United States have stood together for more than a century. And it is indeed a great honor for me to stand alongside my friend, President Biden, here today.
At the heart of our alliance are the enduring values that our people hold in common: our faith in freedom and democracy, a belief in opportunity, a determination to build a more prosperous and more peaceful world. Those values are timeless, and they have never mattered more than right now.
That's why the relationship between Australia and the United States has never been more important. And it, of course—it has never been stronger than it is right now.
We work together to promote peace and security across the Indo-Pacific, to uphold the stability which has generated unprecedented economic opportunity for the nations and the people of our region. For Australia, this is about investing in our capability and investing in our relationships.
Today President Biden and I discussed the progress being made on Australia's acquisition of nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines, which we announced with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in March in San Diego. We are conscious that this is only the second time in history that the United States has shared this technology, and this fact speaks to the deep trust of our alliance and the significance of the challenge that we face together.
Australia appreciates the administration's efforts to operationalize AUKUS and work with Congress to pass the legislation needed to realize our AUKUS ambitions. And I certainly appreciate, once again, Mr. President, your call for this legislation to be passed this year.
AUKUS will drive innovation and cooperation to provide the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom with improved capability to help secure peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. Our cooperation is already unlocking transformative opportunities for jobs and skills and research, from Virginia to South Australia to Western Australia.
Australia and the U.S. have a strong and growing partnership in new technology, from medical research to AI. And I join President Biden in welcoming Microsoft's $5 billion additional investment in Australia, which we announced this week here in Washington.
The President and I agree that innovation is vital to addressing the environmental challenge of climate change and seizing the economic opportunities of clean energy. The Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact that we signed in May in Hiroshima is very much central to this.
Climate change and clean energy becomes a third pillar of our alliance, alongside our security cooperation through ANZUS and our strong economic ties with the free trade agreement between our nations at its center.
The compact lays the foundation for our two countries to advance climate and clean energy action this decade, both at home and globally. Today we agreed new measures under the compact to support our energy transition, including the establishment of an Australia and U.S. Clean Energy Industry Council, comprised of business and public finance leaders to advise government on clean energy industry development and cooperation.
We're working closely with the United States to build end-to-end sustainable, reliable, and transparent supply chains for critical minerals. Of course, Australia has abundant supplies of these critical minerals that will drive our economies throughout this century: lithium, cobalt, copper, vanadium, and rare earths.
We want to connect that with American markets, investors, and technology in a way that creates new jobs and opportunities for industry and workers in both of our nations. Cheaper, cleaner energy will reduce costs for households, but it will also power a new generation of manufacturing.
Our alliance is also delivering for the Indo-Pacific region bilaterally and increasingly with our partners in the Quad. Australia and America are supporting the connectivity of the region, and today we announced a new funding for subsea cables in the Pacific; further support for infrastructure development, including efforts to increase the Pacific's access to financing; and that we'll work together through a new Pacific banking forum to ensure that our friends in the Pacific maintain access to the global financial system.
Today we also discussed our joint position opposing Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. Australia stands with Ukraine. And President Biden welcomed the package of further assistance that I announced yesterday. This will provide Ukraine with additional military assistance, utilizing the innovative technology that's produced by Australia's defense industry partners.
Finally, of course, last night and again today, we spoke about the situation in Israel and Gaza. Australia unequivocally condemns the terrorism of Hamas. We grieve for the loss of every innocent life, whether that be Israeli or Palestinian.
In times of crisis, respect for international humanitarian law is paramount. It is a recognition of our common humanity. And I commend the President for his leadership that he has shown and the example that he has set.
Today I announced that Australia will provide an additional $15 million in humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza. This adds to the $10 million Australia has already committed, and will help deliver lifesaving assistance such as emergency water and medical services.
The friendship between Australia and the United States was forged in hard times. We've served and sacrificed together in the cause of peace. We've helped each other through natural disasters.
Australians and Americans share a rich history, but we always have our eye on the future. We're united by our determination to overcome the challenges that we face, and we share an ambition to seize those opportunities which lay ahead of us.
Ours is indeed an alliance in which we celebrate what we've achieved up to now, but we focus on the future, a future of great opportunities, one that's stronger because of this alliance.
President Biden. All right. We're going to take a few questions now.
Mr. Garrison, USA Today.
U.S. Military Presence in the Middle East/Iran Deterrence 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President and Prime Minister Albanese. Welcome to Washington.
Mr. President, I want to ask about the conflict—the war in the Middle East. Twenty-four U.S. troops have been injured during ten drone or rocket attacks on bases in Iraq and three in Syria over the past week. You've told Iran to, quote, ""be careful"" as your administration tries to prevent the Israeli-Hamas war from expanding into a larger Middle East conflict. But should Americans be worried that the war already is escalating?
And after you answer that question, I'd like one more follow-up, please.
President Biden. About one or two more, huh?
Q. Two or three. [Laughter]
President Biden. Joey, look, we have had troops in the region since 9/11 to go after ISIS and prevent its reassert—reemergence in both—well, anyway, in the region, having nothing to do with Israel at all.
My warning to the Ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops, we will respond, and he should be prepared. It has nothing to do with Israel.
Gaza Hostages/Israeli Military Operations in Gaza 
Q. Well, let me—let me ask my follow-up here. I want to discuss——
[A White House aide handed the reporter a microphone.]
Oh, here we go. Yes, your conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu, who, obviously, you've known for decades, and you had a very emotional trip there last week to Israel. Have you sought assurances from him that he will hold off on a ground invasion into Gaza until the safe relief—release of the hostages can be assured? And of course, those include 10 unaccounted-for Americans.
President Biden. No. What I have indicated to him is that if that's possible to get these folks out safely, that's what he should do. It's their decision, but I did not demand it. I pointed out to him: If it's real, it should be done.
Thank you.
Q. But aren't these hostages in jeopardy if there is a ground invasion?
President Biden. You want to make a speech? [Laughter] No, look——
Q. Yes.
President Biden. ——obviously, they're in jeopardy. The question is whether or not there's any way of getting them out. If we can get them out, we should get them out.
Q. Prime Minister—Prime Minister Albanese—and welcome, again, to Washington—President Biden canceled his May trip to Australia because of debt ceiling talks in Congress to avoid a first-ever default here in the U.S.
More recently, congressional action has stalled as House Republicans try to pick a Speaker. However, it does appear, since we've been out here, that the House has elected a Congressman, Mike Johnson from Louisiana, to that role.
But are you worried that the gridlock in Washington will hold up the transfer of nuclear-powered subs to Australia as part of the AUKUS agreement? And are you concerned, more broadly, that the dysfunction makes the U.S. a less reliable partner?
Prime Minister Albanese. I regard the United States as a very reliable partner. And I regard the relationship that I have with the President as second to none of the relationships that I have around the world or indeed domestically, for that matter. [Laughter]
It's a relationship of trust, and I think this visit symbolizes that. This is the ninth visit that I've had with President Biden. I got to meet President Biden when he was Vice President Biden just next door here some years ago.
And I'm very confident in the discussions that I've had with Democrats and Republicans that there is very broad support for the AUKUS arrangements and that there will be support for the legislation going forward. And I think that would be a very good thing. It is in the interests of Australia, but it's also in the interests of the United States.
And everyone that I have spoken to—similarly in the United Kingdom—across the political spectrum are all supportive of the AUKUS arrangements.
Q. And regarding the Israel-Hamas war, I wanted to ask——
Prime Minister Albanese. Well——
Q. Yes.
Prime Minister Albanese. ——we in Australia have managed to get it so we get one question each. So——
Q. Hey, I figured I'd try and ask a second——
Prime Minister Albanese. Yes, good try.
Q. Anyway, all right.
Prime Minister Albanese. But, Channel 10 Australia.
President Biden. Go get 'em, Joe Joe. [Laughter]
Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) Trilateral Security Partnership/Quadrilateral Security Dialogue
Q. President Biden, just staying with AUKUS. AUKUS is in many ways your creation. It's Australia's largest ever defense deal, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has gone all in. Can you give a personal guarantee that you can get all the necessary legislation through Congress and lock in this deal, essentially future-proofing it, before the end of this Presidential term?
President Biden. Do you know anyone in elective office who can give a personal guarantee that it happens? I won't—I'm not going to——
Q. Well, we'd like you to try.
President Biden. No, I'm going to try, and I believe it will get done.
Look, last week, we requested $3.4 billion in supplemental funds to boost submarine production and maintenance to meet U.S. needs and also support AUKUS. Australia is making a significant—a significant—investment in the United States and its ability to produce submarines as part of this deal. And more importantly, it's important that Congress move quickly.
And the fact is that I'm confident that we can get this done, because—you remember when we put it—the deal together? The response—the Democrats and Republicans in the United States—the response around the free world was: ""This is a very, very good thing. A very good thing.""
So the question is not if, but when, and I—and Joe Joe told us that they—we've got a new Speaker or will likely have a new Speaker. I hope that's true because we have to get moving. We have to get moving. And so I'm—I am confident that we're going to be able to get the money for AUKUS because it's overwhelmingly in our interest.
When I was asked—when we put together the deal, I was asked by Xi Jinping, were we just trying to surround China? I said, ""No, we're not surrounding China."" We're just making sure that the sea lanes remain open, he doesn't unilaterally be able to change the out—the rules of the road in terms of what constitutes international airspace and water space, et cetera. And so that's what this is all about. It's about making sure we have a close—and it's in addition to the fact that we put together the Quad, which they didn't like. The Quad is a very important piece as well.
It's about maintaining stability: stability in the Taiwan Strait, the Indian Ocean, the whole—that whole area. And I think it's going to increase the prospects for long-term peace rather than do anything else.
Prime Minister Albanese. Your turn.
President Biden. Oh, I get to ask. I'm going to get to—okay.
PBS. Ms.—Ms. López [Laura Barrón-López, PBS NewsHour].
Speaker of the House of Representatives J. Michael Johnson 
Q. Mr. President, thank you. If I may, I have a breaking news question and then an Israel one.
First, after 22 days, House Republicans just elected Mike Johnson of Louisiana as the Speaker of the House. Johnson advocated conspiracy theories about voting machines and a rigged election in 2020. He encouraged his colleagues to join a lawsuit to invalidate the results of four States. So, if you win reelection in 2024, are you worried that a Speaker Johnson would again attempt to overturn the election?
President Biden. No.
Q. Why not?
President Biden. Because he can't have—look, just like I was not worried that the last guy would be able to overturn the election. They have about 60 lawsuits, and they—all the way to the Supreme Court, and, every time, they lost. I understand the Constitution.
Israeli Military Operations in Gaza/Civilian Casualties in Gaza 
Q. And if I may, very quickly—in the 18 days since Hamas killed 1,400 Israelis, the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed over 6,000 Palestinians, including 2,700 children. You've previously asked Netanyahu to minimize civilian casualties. Do these numbers say to you that he is ignoring that message?
President Biden. What they say to me is I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's the price of waging a war.
I think we should be incredibly careful. I think—well, not ""we""—the Israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they're focusing on going after the folks that are the propagating this war against Israel. And it's against their interest when that doesn't happen.
But I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.
China 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
Prime Minister Albanese, you're traveling to China early next month. President Biden has said China should expect, quote, ""extreme competition from the United States."" Do you support extreme competition with China? And what does that look like for you?
Prime Minister Albanese. Well, we have strategic competition in our region. That's a fact that we are living with.
The relationship with China is one where the principle that I bring to it is to cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, but engage in our national interest.
It is in Australia's interests, as well as China's—but, I believe, in the global interest—for us to have a relationship where there is dialogue. And hence, I welcome the fact that I have been invited to China.
I'll be traveling at the same time as we will commemorate our 50 years since the first visit by an Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, to China in a short period of time now. And I think that is a positive thing.
It is good that various senior representatives in the U.S. administration have had meetings with their Chinese counterparts in recent times, because dialogue is always a good thing. Through dialogue comes understanding and comes a diffusion of tension.
We want a peaceful and secure region, but we want one as well that's based upon the rule of law and where national sovereignty, including issues such as the South China Sea and the right of passage in that important waterway there—that East China Sea, the Taiwan Straits—is respected. And that is Australia's position.
We cooperate very much with the United States on those matters and on others. But I look forward to a constructive dialogue when I visit Shanghai and Beijing.
President Biden. The context of extreme competition was not conflict. Read the whole paragraph. I talked about—we're going to have—we're going to compete with China on every way according to the international rules—economically, politically, and other ways—but not—I'm not looking for conflict.
Prime Minister Albanese. Geoff.
China 
Q. Yes, Geoff Chambers from the Australian.
President Biden, as mentioned, Prime Minister Albanese flies to Beijing next Saturday to meet the Chinese President and Premier. Your administration has raised deep concerns over a very long period of time about the Chinese Communist Government's aggressive coercion and intimidation tactics; maritime claims in the South China Sea, as we've seen with the situation with the Philippines; state-sponsored cyber attacks.
Last week, we heard from the spy chiefs talking about theft of intellectual property on an industrial scale and, obviously, human rights abuses. What do you make of China's reengagement with Australia? Can Australia trust Beijing? And can Australia do business with China?
President Biden. ""Trust but verify"" is the phrase. And look, China is having their own internal and external difficulties right now. China's economic growth is stagnant compared to what it was. China has engaged in activities that Russia and many other activities that—that others have engaged in, in terms of intimidation and dealing with other countries.
But the fact is that I have met with Xi Jinping more than any other world leader has. I've had over 68 hours of private meetings, just he and I with simultaneous interpreters—starting back when I was Vice President, because it wasn't appropriate for a President of the United States to be meeting with the Vice President. So I traveled 17,000 miles with him.
And I've subsequently—in addition to that 68 hours, I've also had another—they tell me—they keep meticulous contact as I—another, I think, 12, 15 hours of discussions, just he and I.
And I think that he is realizing that there are—for example, his Belt and Road Initiative—well, we're going to compete on that. And we're going to—we're doing it a different way. The Belt and Road Initiative has been a debt and a noose for most of the people that signed on. We are working with our G-7 partners to provide infrastructure for the very nations that he's trying to deal with.
We want to—for example, the G—at the G-20, we were able to act on a proposal I had to bring—to build a railroad all the way from Riyadh, all the way through the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Israel, up through Greece, and then across the—not the railroad, but pipeline across the Mediterranean up into Europe. To——
Q. So you're the more reliable partner?
President Biden. Pardon me?
Q. You're the reliable partner in terms of when you say you're going to deliver something, the U.S. and its partners deliver things.
President Biden. Well, I hope the United—not just me—I hope the United States is a reliable partner when we act. But it wasn't just the United States that agreed on that.
Because, look, even to this day, when my discussions with the Saudis, the Crown Prince, was he wants to see a reconciliation take place. It's overwhelmingly in his interest. It's in Saudis' interest. It's—the idea that you'd have the nations of the Middle East cooperating economically and politically changes the dynamic significantly.
And so I just think that it is—it's something that it's in everyone's interest, including, long-term, in China's interest.
Q. I just had one for the Prime Minister as well. Have you had a chance to speak to Benjamin Netanyahu? I know there's been efforts made. Obviously, the President was there in Israel last week. Are you still endeavoring to speak to the Israeli Prime Minister?
Prime Minister Albanese. I am. I have spoken with the Israeli Ambassador on a number of occasions. We continue to—we understand that, obviously, Mr. Netanyahu has—has pressures on, which at the—the top of the list is not the discussion with the Australian Prime Minister.
We understand the pressures which are there, but we have a request for a call in.
Thank you.
[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]
President Biden. Louder! Holler louder!
Q. [Inaudible]—for a two-state solution? Can you tell us what a two-state solution would look like?
[Several reporters continued asking questions.]
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Thank you, everybody. The press conference has now concluded. Thank you, everyone.
Q. Mr. President, the new Speaker?"""
"Oct 27, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-fifth-anniversary-the-shooting-the-tree-life-or-lsimcha-congregation,"Statement on the Fifth Anniversary of the Shooting at the Tree of Life-Or L'Simcha Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","""Today marks 5 years since the deadly shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, the deadliest act of anti-Semitism in our Nation's history. A gunman opened fire on Sabbath worshippers as they prayed, murdering 11 precious souls, wounding many more, including first responders. The hearts of Jewish communities were shattered, leaving behind survivors and families who will never be the same.
Deepening the wound, today's remembrance comes on the heels of the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. On October 7, a sacred Jewish holiday, the terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure evil against the people of Israel, slaughtering 1,400 Jews and taking hostage hundreds more. This devastating atrocity has brought to the surface painful memories left by millennia of anti-Semitism and the genocide of the Jewish people. The fear is amplified by the alarming rise of anti-Semitism abroad and at home.
Under my Presidency, we will continue to condemn anti-Semitism at every turn. We are increasing security around centers of Jewish life across the country. The Justice Department has made combating hate crimes a top priority. We passed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. And we are implementing the first-ever national strategy to counter anti-Semitism. Because hate never goes away, it only hides until it is given just a little oxygen. And as a nation, we must ensure hate is never given any oxygen.
During these difficult times, we must never lose hope or give up on a better tomorrow. We must recommit to speaking out against bigotry and hate in all its forms, whether it is racism, anti-Semitism, or Islamophobia. And we must come together as fellow Americans to heal the soul of our Nation.""

"Oct 27, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-25th-anniversary-the-international-religious-freedom-act,Statement on the 25th Anniversary of the International Religious Freedom Act,"""Twenty-five years ago, as a United States Senator, I proudly supported the International Religious Freedom Act, a landmark bipartisan law that cemented America's commitment to promoting religious freedom around the world. This right to practice, pray, and preach our faiths peacefully and openly is enshrined in our Constitution. And today, in a moment of so much conflict and disagreement, we must renew our pledge to protect that right. It's more important than ever.
Here at home, we are facing a rising tide of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of discrimination that are fueling violence and hate across our country. And around the world, billions of people live in countries where they are either persecuted or prevented from freely choosing, practicing, teaching, or leaving their faith. That's especially true for members of religious minority communities too often endure intimidation, violence, and unequal protection under the law, while also facing restrictions on their movement, constraints on their access to education and health care, and the fear that their children will be taken and their faith erased. We have seen attacks on Christians in some countries. And we also continue to see repressive governments and violent extremists reach across borders and to target groups for their beliefs, an abhorrent abuse of the human rights and dignity entitled to all people.
The United States will continue to defend religious freedom, today and always. On day one of my administration, we rescinded the discriminatory travel ban against majority-Muslim countries, which betrayed our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all. We established a new Governmentwide group to counter Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and other forms of religious discrimination within the United States, and released the first National Strategy To Counter Antisemitism. Working together with Congress, we implemented the largest-ever increase in funding for physical security of nonprofits, including houses of worship. And in the wake of Hamas' brutal terrorist assault against Israel, we are working with community partners to identify, prevent, and disrupt any threats that could harm the Jewish, Muslim, Arab American, Palestinian American, or any other communities.
Around the world, we have provided more than $100 million to promote religious freedom since the beginning of my administration and hundreds of millions more to provide lifesaving, humanitarian assistance to victims fleeing religious repression, including genocide. We are also denying the entry of goods into the United States that are made with forced labor, too often associated with a genocide of religious minorities. And we have imposed sanctions, visa restrictions, and export controls on actors and entities that are responsible for human rights abuses, including religious persecution.
Like so many others, faith has sustained me throughout my life, serving as a reminder of both our collective purpose and our responsibilities to one another. But for far too many people within our borders and beyond, practicing their faith still means facing fear. Today, on this milestone anniversary of the International Religious Freedom Act, we rededicate ourselves to ensuring that people of all religions, and no religion, feel safe to live out their deepest convictions of conscience with dignity and respect."""
"Oct 27, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-reception-0,Remarks at a Campaign Reception,"""The President. Please sit down. Sit down.
My name is Joe Biden. I'm a friend of Esther Coopersmith's. [Laughter] Esther has been helping me for a long, long, long time.
Sean, thank you for that introduction, by the way.
Esther, you've been a great friend for so long. I want to say in front of everybody, even though Jill's not here, I love you, kid. [Laughter] No, I really do. She's been helping me for longer than she wants to admit.
But—and, Linda, thank you for your support. And I want to thank—Kamala and I are incredibly, incredibly grateful to everyone here. You know, I wanted to acknowledge Virginia—the Virginia House majority [minority; White House correction] leader, who is soon going to be the Speaker of the House.
Where are you, Mr. Speaker—soon-to-be?
Audience member. Right here. Right here.
The President. There you are.
I want you to know, you guys are sending me money, and I'm sending it to Virginia. [Laughter]
You know, many of you in this yard are trial lawyers. I aspired to be a trial lawyer. I couldn't do it, so I decided to be a Senator. [Laughter]
As I like to say, you're one of the few groups standing between us and the barbarians at the gate. And you—you're the ones standing up to the tobacco industry, gun manufacturers, and other corporate—corporations that need to be held accountable. And I really mean that.
Think of what would happen if we didn't have a trial bar. I'm not joking about that. Imagine if we hadn't succeeded with the tobacco industry. You know, we need your help now to end immunity from liability for gun manufacturers. [Inaudible]—the only corporate entity in America, by law, exempted. It's got to stop. It's got to stop.
You see what's happened recently up in—anyway, I won't go into it. But it just is outrageous. You know, who the hell needs an assault weapon that can hold up to—in some cases, up to a hundred rounds? You know, it's just—there's no reason for those—those AR-15s other than to kill people. They're not designed—I—when I was able, along with Dianne Feinstein, to end [pass; White House correction] the assault weapons ban back years ago—a—[inaudible]—where we could only do it for 10 years. Then Bush got elected, and he let it lapse. But you know, mass murders dropped off considerably. Considerably.
And I remember going through Delaware. In the southern part of the State, there's a lot of—awful lot of duck hunting, a lot of hunters in the State. And I was going through, trying to make the case, because I was running, for banning assault weapons.
And I had a guy—so I was walking through the swamp area—for real—and a guy is in there fishing, and he looked at me. He said, ""Biden, you're going to take my damn guns away from me.""
I said: ""I'm not going to take your guns away. I'm just going to take some."" [Laughter] I said—no, I'm serious. I said, ""The Second Amendment doesn't say you can own a cannon. It doesn't say you can own a machinegun. It doesn't say""—I went down the list.
And he said, ""Well, I need it."" And I said, ""You a hunter?"" And he said, ""Yes."" I said, ""You must be one hell of a lousy shot."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. And I said, ""Most deer I know in Delaware aren't wearing Kevlar vests."" [Laughter]
At any rate, the bottom line is that, you know, it's—it just is outrageous what's happening. And we need you. We need you badly. Not a joke.
And I was proud to sign Ending Forced Arbitration for Sexual Assault and Harassment. We should ban forced arbitration. We're almost—and other kinds of dispute as well. You know—I—you know, you share my belief in the importance of increasing—increased diversity in the courts. When I got elected, I said a couple of things: Number one, I wanted my administration to look like America. And it does.
By the way, I was raised in—by women and with—women are a hell of a lot smarter than I am. So we have more women in my Cabinet than men. Not a joke.
And I've been more focused on diversity backgrounds on the bench than any President in American history. Kamala and I have gotten 147 judges confirmed; two-thirds are women, and two-thirds are people of color.
We put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. And guess what? She's smarter than the rest of them too. I made a commitment I—no, she's incredible. And I've appointed more Black women in the Federal circuit courts than every single President combined in American history.
I've gotten a heck of a lot done. I especially want to thank Kamala for her leadership on so many important issues.
You know, we're here tonight because we all believe the country faces a clear choice in November. We're the only nation—the only nation—in the world founded on an idea. Every other nation is founded on ethnicity, religion, or whatever, but not us. We're founded on—only one in the world founded—and it's—we don't focus on it enough—on an idea.
""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by""—we never lived up to it completely, but we've never walked away from it. We're the only one founded on an idea.
And you know, Trump and the MAGA Republicans, they—they've walked away completely from the notion—that notion. You know, we're not going to walk away on my watch, and I need your help.
You know, when I made—you may remember when I ran in 2020 because you're the guys that got me elected. I'm not joking. Along with a hell of a lot of labor unions. [Laughter]
But look, you know, when we ran, we said that—I remember making a speech—and you may remember it; it got a lot of criticism. And they asked me—they asked why I was running. I said I was running for three reasons: One, to restore the soul of America, because over the last 4—the previous 4 years, it was basically lost; secondly, to build the country from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down; and, thirdly, to unite the country.
Well, you know, what happened was—and then—and then I making a speech—I ended up making a couple of speeches, it turned out, on democracy, because I said democracy was at risk.
My entire career, derocracy [democracy; White House correction] has never been, since the Civil War, at risk. But it's at risk. And everybody thought that's an exaggeration. The columnists—they don't do it anymore—talked about, ""Well, that's an exaggeration.""
Except, you know what? Sixty-seven percent of the American people agreed with me that democracy was at risk.
When I left the Vice Presidency at the end of the Obama-Biden administration, I had no intention of running for President or office again. I had just lost my son Beau to burn pits in—in Iraq. He was there a year. And Charlottesville—then Charlottesville happened.
And I don't know if you remember what happened—people coming out of the woods, carrying torches—out of fields literally carrying torches down in Charlottesville. Nazi swastikas accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan and White supremacists, and singing the same vicious, anti-Semitic bile that was sung in Germany in the thirties. And a young woman was killed. A young woman was killed. And I met her mom—I spoke to her mom. And she was a bystander.
And they asked my predecessor, the guy who may be my opponent this time, what he thought. Remember what he said? Not joking. He said, ""There are very fine people on both sides."" ""Very fine people on both sides.""
What President since the time going back to the Civil War has said anything like that? ""Very fine people on both sides.""
Well, let me tell you something: That's when I decided I should run. Because I'm the antithesis of this guy who held office. And I really wasn't going to run, I swear to God, because, as I said, I just lost my son. He's the one who should be standing here talking to you—the attorney general and decorated war hero—not me.
But I got a call from—we have a tradition in my family that my dad started that any child—and this is literally—I mean, literal—any child can ask for a family meeting, and it's taken seriously. And if they ask for a family meeting—only 11 times that I can remember since I've been born that I remember it happening.
And my granddaughters asked for a family meeting. It was on a Thursday. One was a senior at Columbia Law School; two or three were at Penn. Anyway, they're all bright kids. And they came down, and we met in my—our house in Delaware. And they said, ""Pop, you've got to""—they call me ""Pop""—""Pop, you've got to run.""
And I said, ""It's going to be ugly, honey. I don't—I'm not sure""—because I wasn't sure I wanted to put them through it. Their whole lives, they had either had a father who was an attorney general or a grandfather who was a Senator or a Vice President or a President—or a Vice President.
And they said, ""You've got to run."" They gave me all the reasons for wanting to—why I should run. And my youngest one, who's now a senior in high school, named after—he's my—he's the son of my deceased son. His name is Hunter Biden. And Hunter said, ""Pop, we know it's going to be ugly.""
And he took out his cell phone—it's the truth—took out his cell phone, and he opened it up—not opened it. It wasn't open—it wasn't a flip phone; it was a regular phone. [Laughter] And he showed me a photograph of me walking out of St. Anthony's Catholic Church in Delaware—excuse me, St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Delaware with a military funeral with my hand on the casket, draped—flag-draped coffin with my son about to be buried, because he is—he had won the Citizen—the Bronze Star. Anyway——
And I had my hand on my little son [grandson; White House correction] Hunter like I used to hold my son Beau in church, and I had my hand under his chin holding him. Know what the caption read? It said, ""Biden molests another child."" As so he said, ""We know it's going to be mean, Pop, but you got to run."" And that's when I decided to run.
And as I said, one of the reasons I did—ran was to try to restore the soul of this country. We are not who that last guy was. We were in the battle for the soul of America. So I ran because everything this country stood for, everything we believed in, everything that made America ""America,"" even our very democracy, was at risk.
I think people thought I was being hyperbolic when I said—I'd get: ""Joe, what do you mean democracy is a risk? What do you mean we're in a battle for the soul of America?"" Have you noticed most Presidential historians have now agreed with me?
Well, people don't say that anymore. I don't think anyone today doubts democracy was at stake in 2020. But I think it's still at stake in these upcoming elections.
Listen to what they've been saying. Listen to what the MAGA Republicans are talking about. Listen to the language they use. Listen to who they say we are. Listen to say—what they will do if they gain power.
You know, that's why Kamala and I are running again, because we made progress, but our democracy is still at stake. Because, folks, the same man who thought there were, quote, ""very fine people on both sides"" in Charlottesville, who called Hizballah ""very smart""—""Hizballah is very smart""—who recently on more than one occasion has made jokes about the assault on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband.
Now, there are a lot of reasons Donald Trump shouldn't be President, but this one may be the rest [best; White House correction] reason of all. Folks, Kamala and I are asking the entire nation to join us in sending the strongest, clearest, most powerful message possible that political violence is never, never, never, never, never acceptable in America. Never. Never.
And Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy this democracy. And while MAGA Republicans in the House have been fighting among themselves, struggling to elect a Speaker until just now, trying to shut down the Government, sowing division at every turn, Kamala and I are always going to defend, protect, and fight for our democracy. That's why we're running. It's that basic.
This country we live in is so special. Kamala and I don't believe America is a dark, negative nation of carnage, driven by anger, fear, and revenge like the other team does.
And think of what they say. Think of—just listen to what they say.
And by the way, I've been serving in the Congress for 270 years. You know, I've been around a long time. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, you know, there's a lot of—this is not your father's Republican Party.
Many of you know me well. I was known in the United States Senate for those 36 years as being able to bring people together and was able to do that. I got an award for doing that by the Congress when I was leaving—by the Senate when I was leaving.
But this is a different breed of cat. These aren't the same guys. Donald Trump—Donald Trump—think of how he's been able to intimidate that party.
I've had seven senior Republicans who I served with, in the Senate still, who have said to me—and I gave my word I'd never mention who they were, and they don't even know who they are—I mean, one another—that—they made it real clear, ""Joe, I agree with you, but if I—if I join you, I'll be defeated in a primary that Trump will put together."" Not a—not a lot of courage—profiles in courage, but it's a reflection of reality. You've seen it.
To his supporters, he says things like, ""I'm your retribution."" ""We're a failing""—these are quotes. ""We're a failing nation."" ""Either they win, or we win. If we win—if they win, we no longer have a country."" Did you ever think you'd hear those words coming out of a sitting President's mouth or someone seeking that office?
Folks, that's what's at stake. Democracy is literally on the ballot. Kamala and I need you. You all—and most of you, I look around here, don't know any better. You've helped me for a long time. [Laughter]
The first time was your fault. [Laughter] No, but all—all kidding aside. I mean, we can't thank—I can't thank you enough. We need every American who loves our democracy to join us again in 2024. And if we do, we'll have done something few successive generations have been able to do. We will have saved democracy in America.
And I've never been more optimistic about America's future. I really mean it. Think about the possibilities we have.
You know, when I wasn't going to run, I was going to write a book—another book on the inflection points in American history. Almost all of the them have been affected by fundamental changes in technology.
Imagine had Gutenberg not invented the printing press. What would have happened in terms of the implication to Europe and to be able to communicate with one another? Go all the way through every single change that's occurred.
We don't have the means to communicate like we used to because there's no editors anymore. You don't know what's—you know, you don't know what to believe when you read it. There's no editors anymore.
But, folks, we're in a situation where the world is changing, and what happens in the next 4 years and the last 4, 5, 6 years is going to determine what this country looks like for the next six to eight decades. For real. Just like the postwar period.
We have an opportunity to unite the Middle East in a way we never thought. Saudi Arabia wants to deal with Israel. I've been working—at the G-20 in India, I got them to all agree and vote for building a railroad from Delhi all the way up to the—the Mediterranean through the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, all the way to Israel, and then across and pipeline it into Greece and then up.
I mean—because when people share a common economic need and consistency, they tend to work together.
So, look, you know, we just have to remember who we are. You know, we're the only country in the world, in my view—and, I mean—I challenge you who are historians to tell me where I'm wrong about this—only country in the world that's come out of every crisis we've ever entered stronger than we went in—stronger than—we've had serious crises, but stronger and better organized than we went in. That's where we are today.
And you know, I was talking to somebody who came up to me—and I'm not going to mention his name; don't want to embarrass him—in the photo line, telling me he was talking to the U.N., and there was people saying, ""Thank you for the United States.""
Folks, I've spent my entire career dealing with American foreign policy, either as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee or doing it for Barack in his term or—as—as Vice President—my term as Vice President, 8 years, or now.
One of the things I have learned: Madeleine Albright was right. We are the essential nation. That is not hyperbole. Not Joe Biden. We—the President of the United States is the essential—leader of the essential nation.
And every single leader I talk to, they—they almost come to—kind of stand at attention. We pull the world together. We've kept NATO together. We've kept everybody together in terms of taking on Putin. We're organizing the world relative to the attack on Israel. We're doing—I mean, we have an opportunity, but we also have enormous obligation.
We're the United States of America, for God's sake. And there's nothing, nothing beyond our capacity—nothing, I mean that—when we do it together.
So my objective hasn't changed. I'm still running for the same reason: to continue to build a consensus about what democracy means, continue to try to restore the soul of this country, and to continue to work in a way that we can deal with the fact that a minority—but a powerful minority—on the other team doesn't try to bring us down, doesn't try to turn this into some—like a circus.
So I want to thank you all for giving me another shot. I didn't plan on doing this, either. [Laughter] But I tell you what, I'm sure in hell not going to walk over with Trump on the horizon.
Thank you all so very, very much—[inaudible].""	Remarks at a Campaign Reception"
"Oct 30, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-signing-executive-order-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use,"Remarks on Signing an Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence","""Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. Please have a seat.
To our President, Joe Biden; Members of Congress; members of our administration; and our private sector and civil society partners:
As leaders from government, civil society, and the private sector, I believe we have a moral, ethical, and societal duty to make sure that AI is adopted and advanced in a way that protects the public from potential harm and ensures that everyone is able to enjoy its benefits. Since we took office, President Biden and I have worked to uphold that duty.
Before generative AI captured global attention, President Biden and I convened leaders from across our country, from computer scientists to civil rights leaders to legal scholars and business leaders, all to help make sure the benefits of AI are shared equitably and to address predictable threats, such as algorithmic discrimination, data privacy violations, and deep fakes.
We named it the ""Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights."" After which, President Biden and I had extensive engagement with the leading AI companies to help ensure the private sector commits to the principles in the blueprint and to establish a minimum baseline of responsible AI practices.
We intend that the actions we are taking domestically will serve as a model for international action, understanding that AI developed in one nation can impact the lives and livelihoods of billions of people around the world. Fundamentally, it is our belief that technology with global impact requires global action.
Tomorrow I will travel to the United Kingdom to represent our Nation at the Global Summit on AI Safety. There, we will work with our allies and our partners to apply existing international rules and norms with a purpose to promote global order and stability and, where necessary, to build support for additional rules and norms that meet this moment.
Let us be clear: When it comes to AI, America is a global leader. It is American companies that lead the world in AI innovation. It is America that can catalyze global action and build global consensus in a way that no other country can. And under President Joe Biden, it is America that will continue to lead on AI.
And there are many ways to define the leadership of our President, Joe Biden——
[At this point, the President raised his eyebrows.]
——as even a quick review of his most recent—[laughter]—as even a quick review of his most recent victories makes clear. From creating technology innovation hubs in 31 communities across our Nation, to expanding America's semiconductor industry, to making the largest investment ever in climate in America's history.
So just a few points to say that President Biden is a leader with a vision for our future. He has the ambition to meet the challenges of the moment here and around the globe. And he has the courage and skill to lead us forward, including on AI.
And with that, it is my great honor and privilege to introduce our President, Joe Biden.
The President. Thank you. Please.
I'm going to remind you of that. I'm teasing. [Laughter]
Thank you, Kamala, for that introduction and for your leadership on this issue.
Auto Industry Labor Agreements 
Before I begin, I want to explain why I was delayed a few minutes. I have just spoken with President Fein of the United Auto Workers. And let me say a few words about the UAW and the Big Three automakers—Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. They have reached a historic agreement and a hard-fought faith—agreement that was really battled for a while. But it was all done in good faith.
And these record agreements reward auto workers who gave up much to keep the industry working and going during the financial crisis more than a decade ago. These agreements ensure the iconic Big Three can still lead the world in quality and innovation.
Due to the commitment and solidarity of the UAW workers willing to exercise their right—their right to collectively bargain, they've won a record contract with over a 30-percent increase in wages, greater retirement security, and more paid leave, and a commitment by the Big Three to create more full-time, middle class jobs and invest tens of billions more dollars in plants and factories, building an automobiles future here in America.
I applaud—[applause]—I applaud the UAW and the leaders of the automobile companies for agreeing that all the workers on strike and all those who were walking the picket lines on behalf of the UAW brothers and sisters can come back to work immediately even before the vote is taken.
Ultimately, the final word on this contract will be for the UAW memberships themselves in the days and coming weeks as they vote. But here's what I know and what I shared with the United Auto Workers I met in the picket line: I've always believed that the middle class built America and that unions built the middle class. And that's especially the case for United Auto Workers who built the iconic automobile industry.
For too long, in my view, the economy hasn't worked for working people and for middle class folks. Because when they do well, by the way, everybody does well. That's why I came into office determined to build an economy—to build from the middle out and the bottom up, instead of the top down.
It's a critical piece of worker power. And it's showing how collective bargaining works by providing workers a seat at the table to honor their contributions to their employees'—their employer's success by securing pay and benefits they can raise a family on and retire with dignity and respect. It's showing how collective bargaining works for companies, how a strong relationship between workers and management can mean record profits leading to record contracts.
We're also seeing it across the board for the UAW workers—we're seeing this everywhere—rail workers, port workers, Teamsters, writers, health workers, and workers on other industries organizing and—by collective bargaining.
Folks, look, today's historic agreement is yet another piece of good economic news showing something I've always believed: Worker power—worker power—is critical to building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, and so is economic growth.
We just learned that our economy grew 4.9 percent in the last quarter—the highest growth in 2 years—just as inflation continues to come down. We have more to do, but we're finally beginning to build an economy that works for working people, for the middle class, for the entire company—the entire country, including the companies. Because when we do that, the poor have a ladder up, the middle class does well, and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.
And that brings me to today's announcement.
Artificial Intelligence 
Folks, I want to thank Kamala again for the work she's done through her entire career to protect people from harm and to promote responsible innovation. She's traveling to the United Kingdom, as she pointed out, this week, where she'll highlight how America is setting the standard for AI safety, security, and trust.
I want to thank all of you for joining us here. Some of you—members of my Cabinet, Members of Congress—including the Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, who has been a real leader on this. Chuck, thank you, pal. You've—and State and Senate—and local officials; leaders in technology, business, labor, academia, civil rights, and civil society.
And we'll see more—well, you know, I know you know this, but we're going to see more technological change in the next 10, maybe the next 5 years than we've seen in the last 50 years, and that's a fact. And it's the most consequential technology of our time. Artificial intelligence is accelerating that change. It's going to accelerate it at warp speed.
AI is all around us. Much of it is making our lives better. And AI is helping the National Weather Service predict weather events, helping Webb tech—the Webb—the Webb Telescope manage half a million miles of galaxies away—billions of light-years away.
I found out when I was turning on my phone and saw that, I thought: ""My God, what is this? Science fiction."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. You—didn't you have the same thought when you saw it? [Laughter]
AI is helping millions of commuters find the shortest route home as well. [Laughter]
But, you know, in some cases, AI is making life work—worse. For example, using teenagers' personal data to figure out what will keep them glued to their device, AI makes social media more addictive. It's causing what our Surgeon General calls a ""profound risk of harm"" to their mental health and well-being.
Over the past years, Kamala and I have met with a range of experts, many of whom are here today—and I thank you for coming here today—on the risks and the incredible opportunities of AI. One thing is clear: To realize the promise of AI and avoid the risks, we need to govern this technology, not—and there's no other way around it, in my view. It must be governed.
That's why we're here today.
I'm about to sign an Executive order. An Executive order that is the most significant action any government anywhere in the world has ever taken on AI safety, security, and trust. This order builds on the critical steps we've already taken to ensuring the AI Bill of Rights to bring together leading AI companies who agreed to voluntarily make certain commitments to make sure AI is safe and a system is secure.
With today's Executive order I'll soon be signing, I'm determined to do everything in my power to promote and demand responsible innovation.
First, the Executive order is about AI safety and security. Today I am invoking what's called the Defense Production Act that Federal Government uses in the most urgent of moments, like mobilizing the nation during—a nation in time of war or developing COVID vaccines during the pandemic.
This Executive order will use the same authority to make companies prove—prove—that their most powerful systems are safe before allowing them to be used. I want to—before allowing them to be used. That means companies must tell the Government about the large-scale AI systems they're developing and share rigorous independent test results to prove they pose no national security or safety risk to the American people.
At the same time, I will direct the Department of Energy to make sure AI systems don't pose chemical, biological, or nuclear risks at the same time.
Look, in the wrong hands, AI can make it easier to—for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the software that makes our society run. That's why I'm directing the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, both of them, to develop game-changing cyber protections that will make our computers and our critical infrastructure more secure than it is today. And that's why my administration has taken decisive steps to prevent cutting-edge—these cutting-edge AI chips from being used to undermine our national security, which is possible.
Second, the order is about making sure that AI systems can earn the American people's trust and people's trust around the world.
All too often, already—it's already happening that AI devices are being used to deceive people. Deep fakes use AI-generated audio and video to smear reputations, speak—spread fake news, and commit fraud.
With AI, fraudsters can take a 3-second—and you all know this—3-second recording of your voice—I've watched one of me on a couple—[laughter]. I said, ""When the hell did I say that?"" [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, 3-second recording of your voice and generate an impersonation good enough to fool—you know, I was going to say your family—fool you. [Laughter] I swear to God. Take a look at it. It's mind-blowing.
And they can use it to scam loved ones into sending money because they think you're in trouble. That's wrong. Everyone has a right to know when audio they're hearing or video they're watching is generated or altered by AI.
Thanks to this order, the Department of Commerce is going to help develop standards to watermark and clearly label AI-generated content. Just say this—that's how it was generated: AI-generated. That way, you can tell whether it's real and it's not. And when your loved ones hear your voice on the phone, they'll know it's really you.
Trust matters. Trust matters.
Third, this Executive order is about protecting your fundamental rights to—like privacy. Without safeguards, AI can put your privacy at greater risk. That's why I've called for new protections on your personal data. With this Executive order, my administration is going to help develop—develop leading-edge technology to make those protections as strong as possible.
Look, privacy is not the only right at risk. Without the right safeguards in place, AI can lead to discrimination, bias, and other abuses.
That's why, with the help of civil rights leaders here today, this order directs several actions to protect Americans' civil rights and their safety. That means clear guidance for landlords and Federal contractors and Federal programs to prevent the bias in AI tools that can be used to make decisions on whether or not someone qualifies for housing or benefits or a job.
We'll develop the best practices for AI use to ensure fairness in the criminal justice system as well. And, when appropriate, the Justice Department and the Federal Civil Rights offices will investigate and prosecute AI-related civil rights violations.
A fourth thing this order does: It will ensure that emerging technology works for consumers and for workers. For example, to protect patients, we'll use AI to develop cancer drugs that work better for—and cost less. We'll also launch a safety program to make sure AI health systems do no harm.
To protect workers, this order directs the Government to help make sure AI isn't used to shortchange workers. I've also asked for a comprehensive report on the potential impact of AI on the labor market and how to help workers whose jobs have been disrupted.
We're going to support workers in every industry by defining their rights and defending them—to a fair wage, to organize, and as these other—more technologies emerge.
And, finally, we're going to make sure America leads the world in innovation and attracts the top talent to stay at the cutting edge. And because AI's challenges and opportunities are global, we're going to keep advancing American leadership globally.
In meeting around—in meetings around the world, I've heard from leaders, and I've been going around the world a lot lately. [Laughter] It's good to be home. [Laughter]
And we're looking—but leaders around the world, as they approach me—I mean it—in any country, they ask: ""Is the United States going to show the way in AI? Will the United States lead?"" I'm sure Kamala is going to hear this when she's in the United Kingdom later this week.
And we'll continue to work closely with allies and partners, including the United Nations, the G-7—and the G-7, which just set out the first-ever international code of conduct to safely guide AI development.
Look, let me be clear: This Executive order represents bold action, but we still need—we still need Congress to act. We need Congress to act.
I want to thank—I just want to thank Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer here. Chuck, you've been—you've taken the reins on this issue like no one else could. You've developed legislation to harness the power of AI while keeping Americans safe. Tomorrow I look forward to meeting with you and the bipartisan group that you've put together to bring down to the White House to underscore the need for congressional action.
I'm going to continue to call on Congress to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on our kids and teenagers online; to ban—[applause]—to ban targeting advertising to children; to limit the personal data these collectors—these—these companies collect on us.
Folks, let me close with this. We face a genuine inflection point in history, one of those moments where the decisions we make in the very near term are going to set the course for the next decades. And with the position we lead the world, the toughest challenges are the greatest opportunities.
Look, there's no greater change that I can think of in my life than AI presents as a potential: exploring the universe, fighting climate change, ending cancer as we know it, and so much more.
As artificial intelligence expands the boundary of human possibility and tests the bounds of human understanding, this landmark Executive order is a testament to what we stand for: safety, security, trust, openness, American leadership, and the undeniable rights endowed by our Creator that no creator—no creation can take away, proving once again that America's strength is not just the power of its example [example of its power; White House correction] but the example of its power [power of its example; White House correction].
Look, I know we can meet this moment with hope and not fear because of all of you—and I mean it sincerely—because all of you here today, many of you are the originators of this technology. And all across America, the people are focused on this.
You're the reason why—and I mean this sincerely—you're the reason why I've never been more optimistic about America's future. We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we do it together.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Now I'm going to go over and sign that.
[The President moved to the signing table.]
Thank you, thank you, thank you. ""Executive Order—Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.""
[The President signed the Executive order.]
Thank you.
[The President returned to the podium and spoke as follows.]
I really want to thank all the businesses who are here and all the people who've—involved in developing AI. You've been incredibly responsible. Thank you, thank you. And thank you for educating us on this as well. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[The President left the podium and greeted audience members. As he was leaving the room, several reporters shouted questions as follows.]

"Nov 01, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-northfield-minnesota,"Remarks in Northfield, Minnesota","""The President. Hello, hello, hello! Well, folks, please take a seat if you have one. [Laughter] I said that some time ago—""take a seat""—and there weren't any seats in the room. And they said: ""See? That Biden, he doesn't even know there's no seats."" [Laughter]
Situations in Gaza and Israel/U.S. Diplomatic Efforts 
At any rate, before I start today, I would like to say a few words about the latest developments in the Gaza Strip in Israel.
Today, thanks to concerted American leadership, we're in a situation where safe passage for wounded Palestinians and foreign nationals to exit Gaza has started. American citizens were able to exit today as part of the first group of probably over a thousand. We'll see more of this process going on in the coming days.
We're working nonstop to get Americans out of Gaza as soon and as safely as possible. This is the result of intense and urgent American diplomacy with our partners in the region. I personally spent a lot of time speaking with the Prime Minister, Netanyahu, of Israel and President Sisi of Egypt and others to make sure that we could open this access for people to get out.
I want to thank our partners in the region and particularly Qatar, who have worked so closely with us to support negotiations to facilitate the departure of these citizens.
At the same time, we're continuing working to significantly step up the flow of critical humanitarian assistance into Gaza. The number of trucks entering Gaza continues to increase significantly, but we still have a long way to go.
The United States is going to continue to drive humanitarian support for innocent people in Gaza who need help. And they do need help.
We're going to continue to affirm that Israel has the right to and responsibility to defend its citizens from terror, and it needs to do so in a manner, though, that's consistent with international and humanitarian law that prioritizes the protection of citizens.
We've all seen the devastating images from Gaza: Palestinian children crying out for lost parents, parents reasoning and writing their children's names on their hands and legs to be identified if the worst happens.
[At this point, a child in the audience cried out.]
It's okay. Kids are allowed to do that with me. [Laughter] Don't worry about it. All right? I don't blame her. Is it a him or her?
Audience member. Her!
The President. I don't blame her. [Laughter]
Look, the loss of every innocent life is a tragedy.
We grieve for those deaths and continue to grieve for the Israeli children and mothers who were brutally slaughtered by Hamas terrorists and also continue to hold in our hearts the hundreds of families and loved ones, including small children and elderly grandparents, including American citizens, being held hostage.
My administration continues to work around the clock to reunite those families. We're not going to give up. Period. [Applause] We're not going to give up. And I am optimistic. But then, I am an optimist.
National Economy 
Folks, now I want to thank Brad for that introduction. And Brad said he wasn't sure what a good speaker was. He can speak a hell of a lot better than I can farm.
And I'm glad to be accompanied by—I want to talk about my administration and its investment in rural America. But I also want to thank Governor Vilsack—former Governor Vilsack, now the Secretary of Agriculture.
Look, creating opportunities for family farmers and the Tribal communities across the country is what we're trying to do here.
And, Tim—and, Governor Walz—Governor, it's a great—thank you for the great work and the partnership and what you're doing here in Minnesota.
And Mayor Pownell—Rhonda? Where's Rhonda, the mayor? There you are, Mayor. Thank you for being here as well. I appreciate it. And thank you for the passport into the city. [Laughter] I don't get many passports these days. [Laughter]
Over the past 40 years or so, we've had a practice in America—an economic practice called trickle-down economics, and it hit rural America especially hard. It hollowed out Main Street, telling farmers the only path to success was to get big or get out. Tax cuts for big corporations encouraged companies to grow bigger and bigger, move jobs and production overseas for cheaper labor, and undercut local small businesses.
Meat-producing companies and the retail grocery chains consolidated, leaving farmers with [and; White House correction] ranchers with few choices about where to sell their products, reducing their bargaining power. Corporations that sell seed, fertilizer, and even farm equipment used their outsized market power to change farmers and charge them and ranchers unfair prices.
You know, in part because of these conditions, over the past four decades, we lost over 400,000 farms in America—400,000—over 141 [140; White House correction] million acres of farmland. And that's an area roughly equal to the size of Minnesota, North and South Dakota combined—the three.
Facing higher costs and earning less, family farms have struggled to make it work—to make the math work, and the promise of keeping the farm in the family is slipping out of reach for so many across America. And when family farms go by the wayside, small businesses, hospitals, schools that support them, they suffer as well in the community.
And, as a result, farmers and ranchers and rural business owners, including scores of young people, have to leave home in search of good-paying jobs and a chance at the American Dream.
All over rural America, young people are saying to their parents: ""Can I live here anymore? I can't do it because I can't find a job. You gave me an education, but there's nothing for me here. I've got to leave."" I came to office determined to change that.
And, by the way, parenthetically, I come from a State that people think is all either manufacturing, DuPont—all the—all like those kind—but it's also a $4 billion industry in agriculture in the Delmarva Peninsula, almost all chickens and soybeans. But I watched what happened in my community. I watched what happened in—all across America.
Now, we're growing an economy from the middle out and bottom up, instead of the top down. And, folks, there's a practical reason for that. When the middle class does well, the poor have a way up, and the wealthy still do very well. It's—everybody does better.
When rural America does well, when Indian Country does well, we all do well.
And folks in the press have been calling my plan ""Bidenomics."" Well, it's about investing in all of America—all of America—including rural America. It's about making things in rural America again.
And that's exactly what the historic legislation we passed has done: creating new and better markets and new income streams so that generations of rural Americans can begin to thrive again.
For example, through our clean energy initiatives contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, we're investing nearly $20 billion—$20 billion; the money is there—to help farmers and ranchers tackle climate crisis through climate-smart agriculture and cover crops, nutrient management, prescribed—[inaudible]—and sorting carbon in the soil—storing in the soil, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while improving overall health of the soil and the water.
And instead of doing what they have to do now, depending on one income stream and being at the mercy of the commodity markets and the big corporations, under our plan, farmers can diversify and earn additional income just selling into the local markets. You know, it's—it matters.
Let me give you an example. When a farmer sells his commodities normally, you have to go through the grocery store, and the farmers gets about 18 cents for every Federal dollar—or, excuse me, every dollar they have. Sometimes, you get less than that.
Some—but when a farmer sells locally, the farmers can get anything from 50 to 75 cents for their same exact product, in addition to producing renewable energy and taking advantage of the bioeconomy.
The result of family farms that were barely making ends meet used these funds we've provided to improve their bottom line after being squeezed by big corporations for so long.
Look, we're also promoting competition in agricultural markets.
For too long, farmers like Brad and his brother and his dad and mom have had to sell their hogs—not just a handful of meat processors—there was only a handful that existed—outsized control over the industry, and they set the prices as well.
Well, let me put this in—this perspective to you. Just four big corporations control more than half the market in beef, pork, and poultry. And because so few companies control so much of the market, if one of those processing plants goes off line, it can cause massive supply chain disruptions, slowing production, and cost farmers big.
It happened to Brad when processing plants shut down during the pandemic, and he had to rely on social media to sell his hogs.
Folks, look, there's something wrong when just 7 percent of the American farms get nearly 90 percent—7 percent get 90 percent of the farm income, and most farmers rely on jobs off the farm to be able to make ends meet on the farm.
When I took office, I decided to invest a billion dollars through the American Rescue Plan in small and medium-sized independent meat processors to expand their capacity.
And to folks who don't understand that like the people here do, that's—what happens is, it improves competition. More people are competing for the products, so farmers get to price—a fair price for their product. It's about basic fairness.
Right now the farmers and ranchers who actually grow the food, only to see a small percentage of the profit when the food is sold. So when—so we're strengthening local food systems so rural communities have better access to affordable, locally grown food, so the farmers who provide the food actually benefit from it.
Through the bipartisan infrastructure law—it's a fancy name, but it's about rebuilding America's bridges, roads, highways, et cetera—we're making the most substantial investment since President Eisenhower's rural American—since—in rural America since Eisenhower's highway plan—roads, bridges, inland waterways, ports, regional airports, clean water, high-speed internet.
We're building affordable high-speed internet for every household. Over 230,000 Minnesotans' households are already saving $30 or more per month on their internet bills through the Affordable Connectivity Program.
But I'm going to need your help. That program is running out of funds. I sent Congress a request for more funding, and they should act now—act on it now.
We're also investing—[applause]. We're also investing over $50 million to bring high-speed internet to Tribal communities here in Minnesota alone.
We're also making the largest investment in rural electrification since FDR, providing grants and loans to rural electric co-ops to supply rural communities with affordable, reliable clean energy as well.
Today I'm proud to announce new funding that will go directly to rural communities: $1 billion to fix aging critical rural infrastructure, like electric water—like electricity, water—waste water systems that haven't been replaced in decades.
We're investing millions in building new bioeconomy and—with homegrown biofuels, which will contribute nearly $3 billion to Minnesota's economy over—every year as it saves a—as an important market for family farms to be able to do this.
And, folks, this is just a start. Today I'm announcing we're investing nearly $2 billion to help more farmers adopt practices to fight climate change and earn new income. We're investing $145 million for farmers and rural communities to install clean energy technologies, like solar panels, and lowering electric bills; an additional $274 million will expand rural high-speed internet even further.
Two billion to support communities in our Rural Partners Network, which puts Federal employees on the ground to help rural communities take advantage of the Federal resources—let them know what they are and where they are.
We're also making rural America—we're also making sure rural America can compete with clean energy manufacturing jobs of the future. Earlier this year, I was in Minnesota, where, over a century, Cummins built diesel engines in heavy-duty trucks and power generators. But now, thanks to the legislation I signed, the tax credit for clean energy, Cummins is converting its facility to make essential components for producing clean hydrogen used for cleaner production of everything from cars to trucks to steel to cement to manufacturing. And it's going to create thousands of jobs.
And in places like Ohio and outside of Syracuse, New York, and all over the country—including in rural America—semiconductor companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars—not a joke—hundreds of billions of dollars to bring chip production back home.
You know those—those little computer chips about the size of the tip of your little finger? We invented them in America. We made them more sophisticated. And we lost the ability to make them because we only had, now, 10 percent of the production.
I went to South Korea to meet with Samsung and other groups. And I said, ""Hey, look, why don't you come and invest in America?"" And guess what? The South Korean company came along, and they're going to invest $200 million. We have over—or excuse me, $20 billion. We're going to invest over $350 billion in building these chips.
And everything in our lives from cell phones to automobiles, refrigerators, the most sophisticated weapons systems rely on these.
I might add, the factory being used to produce these chips—they call them ""fabs""—employ thousands of people. You know what the average salary in those factories is going to be? Over $100,000 a year, and you don't need a college degree. That's a—that's the truth. All that means good jobs—good jobs—in rural America.
The bottom line is this: Instead of exporting jobs overseas for cheaper labor, now we're creating jobs here and expanding American products and selling them overseas. Folks, we're not only transforming rural communities, we're transforming our economy.
A year ago, experts said a recession was almost guaranteed. Remember—[inaudible]—""A recession is coming, a recession is coming."" Well, guess what? Just last week, we learned the economy grew by nearly 5 percent the last quarter, proving the experts wrong.
Since I took office, we've created 13.9 million jobs since I was elected. We created more jobs in 2 years than any President has done in a 4-year term. And nearly 200,000 of those new jobs are right here in Minnesota—200,000.
Remember we were told we'd no longer be the manufacturing capital of the world? Well, guess what? We've created 815,000 manufacturing jobs, twice as many as the previous administration. Where does it say we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world? Where is that written?
The unemployment rate has stayed below 4 percent for 20 months in a row, the longest stretch in 50 years.
And inflation is coming down at the same time. It's down from 60 percent—it's down 60 percent since last summer. Core inflation is the lowest level in 2 years, and we have the lowest inflation of any major economy in the world.
Folks, all of this is no accident. It's Bidenomics.
And by the way, we've got more to do. We've got more to do.
We're creating good jobs in communities across rural America, including in places where [for; White House correction] decades factories that were open, that families worked at, got shut down. Towns were hollowed out; jobs moved overseas. Over the past few decades, these communities lost more than jobs. They lost their sense of dignity, opportunity, pride.
My plan is about investing in rural America. It's about something else as well. It's about restoring pride in the rural—to rural communities that have been left behind for far too long. No, you really have. It's not hyperbole.
For decades, families like Brad's sat around the kitchen table with their kids and grandkids worrying, wondering, ""How can we keep the farm in the family?"" Because of these investments we're making, family farms like this one will stay in the family, and children and grandchildren like Brad won't have to leave home to make a living.
And when Brad sits around the kitchen table with his 4-year-old son and 20-month-old daughter—she'll understand at all, right away—[laughter]—who are here today, he doesn't have to worry about if the farm is going to stay in the family if they want it to.
Folks, Bidenomics is just another way of saying ""the American Dream.""
Forty years ago, trickle-down economics limited the dream to those at the top. But I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to get a job, no matter where they live—in the heartland, in small towns—to raise their kids on a good paycheck and keep their roots where they grew up.
You know, my dad used to an expression. For real, he'd say—he said: ""Joey""—I mean it sincerely—""a job's more than about a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about pride. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it."" That's the American Dream. That's Bidenomics.
It's rooted in what's always worked best for the country: investing in America—investing in America—and investing in Americans, no matter where they live: in rural communities, Tribal communities, suburbs, or cities. Because I believe a President is supposed to represent all American people, not just some Americans.
Folks, here's the deal. It's never been a good bet to bet against the American people—never, never, never. I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today. We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America.
And think about this: We've always come out of every conflict we've gotten into—we've always—every problem we've had, stronger than when we went in. There is nothing beyond our capacity. Think about it. Anything we've ever set our mind to as a nation, we've never failed to succeed. Not a joke. Never failed to succeed.
Nothing is beyond our capacity when we do it together. So let's unite this country. Let's do it together.
Let's make sure that those who want to stay on the farm can stay as long as they want because they make a good, decent living.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.""	Remarks in Northfield, Minnesota"
"Nov 01, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-reception-minneapolis-minnesota,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Minneapolis, Minnesota","""The President. Thank you very much. Please. Please, sit down.
What generous introductions. Folks, as I was being introduced, I thought to myself how much—and you wouldn't know this necessarily—this State has meant to me and my career and, quite frankly, my emotional sanity. [Laughter] And I know that sounds strange, but it's true.
You know, when I first—excuse—as we used to say in the Senate, ""a point of personal privilege."" When I first got elected to the United States Senate, I wasn't old enough to be sworn in. I was 29 years old, and I had to wait 17 days to be eligible. [Laughter]
And I was down in Washington borrowing Teddy Kennedy's office, interviewing staff before I got sworn in. And I got a phone call telling me my wife and daughter were dead, and my two boys were not likely to live. And I just wanted to get out. I didn't want to be sworn in.
My brother, who was 23 at the time, was my chief fundraiser. [Laughter] My sister Valerie was managing my campaign. And we elected a Democratic Governor, and I knew that we'd be able to have someone with my generic views appointed to that spot. And—but along came two people who, among five, saved my sanity. And I mean it sincerely, from the bottom of my heart.
The first was Hubert Humphrey. Hubert Humphrey—Hubert Humphrey took me under his wing and almost on a daily basis would come by my office. He convinced me to stay—he and Teddy Kennedy and Fritz and—and Walter Mondale. I mean—excuse me—and the Senator from South Carolina. They all convinced me. They said, ""Just stay 6 months."" Because I didn't want to stay in the Senate. I just wanted to get the hell out and not do it.
And it worked all the way through. To the day that Hubert died, I never called him Hubert; I always called him ""Boss."" And Fritz Mondale, I remember Fitz coming by the Vice President's residence and wanted to see—I remember we walked up to the third floor where his daughter was, and he stood there—had been, and he stood there, and he filled up and started to cry because of the losses.
My generic point is that these men had heart. And so I've been coming to Minnesota just to—just—Hubert Humphrey, just to keep me occupied. I mean it sincerely. To keep me engaged. And looking back on it, I don't know that I'd be—I know I wouldn't be standing here were it not for those two men.
So—and the introductions today were just so lovely. Thank you so much. I really mean it.
Look, Ken and Stacey, you—I thank you for your support, and also—you know, I was with Tim all day today. He's—[laughter]—he's a hell of a guy, man. [Laughter]
There you are. That man is the real deal. [Laughter] And I tell you, I couldn't understand—fully understand until I found out he was a senior sergeant major in the United States military. [Laughter]
Ken, thank you very much. And I want to thank all the State and local officials for—and the Tribal leaders here today. Kamala and I are incredibly grateful for everyone here. And I mean it sincerely.
Look, normally, events like this, we talk about the accomplishments that—of our office that we—that we think we did well on. But Ken took care of all that for me. [Laughter]
Because even today, a lot of Americans don't know what we've done. They know, like, how many jobs—we've created 14 million jobs, more jobs than any President has created in 4 years.
We've also put the first Black woman in the United States Supreme Court. And we passed the biggest investment in the history of the world climate—to fight climate change. And if I have anything to do with it, I'm going to end up signing a law reinstating Roe v. Wade. And, folks—and Kamala has been essential to all of this, her leadership in so many important issues.
And, folks, tonight I want to talk about something else rather than just our accomplishments, which I think you're going to—I'm an optimist. I remember when I was a young Senator and I was—I had these horrible headaches, and I—turned out, I had a cranial aneurysm, and I had to get to the hospital. I remember the doctors rolling me down to the operating room. I look at the anesthesiologist and said, ""How am I going to do?""
He said, ""Oh, your—your chances are good."" I said, ""What are they?"" He said, ""Well, they're 35, 40 percent."" [Laughter]
And I thought, ""That's pretty damn good."" And afterwards, I said—I was trying to figure out whether aneurysms were congenital or they were—anyway. And he—I said, ""Look""—I said, ""I don't need to know whether they're congenital or hereditary,"" but I said, ""Here's the deal."" I said, ""Just—you just tell me what to do.""
And he looked at me, and he says—true story—the nurse said, ""You know your problem, Senator?"" I was a Senator then. He said, ""You're a congenital optimist."" [Laughter]
Well, I am. I am. And I have—and I have enormous, enormous faith and confidence in this incredible time of change. The change—you know, about every six, eight generations, there's a—we go through a phenomenal change. What happens in the next 2, 3, 4 years is going to determine what the next four or five decades are going to look like. More change is going to occur in the next 10 years than occurred in the last 50 years, maybe even the next 5 years.
And so, folks, I want to talk about, though, what's at stake in this country.
You know, when I was Vice President at the end of the Obama-Biden administration, I had no intention of running again for public office. I had just lost the love of my life, my son Beau, who was a wonderful young man. He was a—he was attorney general of Delaware. He was going to announce for Governor; no one was even going to announce against him.
My favorite headline of all time, he got elected attorney general the year that I got reelected, and he—and the headline said ""Biden, dash, Beau: Most Popular Man in Delaware."" [Laughter] And he was a major in the U.S. Army. He—but you know—and I wasn't going to run again. I was going to write a book and set up an institute. I was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and they—the Biden institute and the domestic policy institute at the University of Delaware. And I—that's what I was going to do.
But then along came Charlottesville. Remember Charlottesville, Virginia—what happened? Well, I was about to announce that I stay—that I was staying right where I was, when I was—you know, and you remember what happened. Those folks came out of the woods in the fields with torches—torches, singing the same anti- —chanting the same anti-Semitic bile that was chanted in Germany in the early thirties, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. Not a joke. And a young woman bystander was killed.
And the previous President, who is seeking the job again, was asked what he thought about it. You know what he said? He said, ""There are very fine people on both sides."" ""Very fine people on both sides.""
When I heard that, I knew I couldn't——
[At this point, there was an audience disruption.]
Jewish Voice for Peace member Jessica Rosenberg. Mr. President, if you care about Jewish people, as a rabbi, I need you to call for a cease-fire right now.
Audience member. Sit down!
Audience member. Get out! Get out!
The President. No, no, no. No, let——
Ms. Rosenberg. [Inaudible]—Palestinians and Israelis have died. Please explain to me why.
Audience member. Ma'am, you need to leave the event.
The President. Let—if you'll be quiet, I'll answer your question.
Ms. Rosenberg. I would love for you to answer my question, please.
The President. I think we need a pause.
Ms. Rosenberg. A pause?
The President. Yes, a pause, for——
Ms. Rosenberg. What is a pause?
The President. A pause means give time to get the prisoners out. Give time—[applause].
Ms. Rosenberg. [Inaudible] If you're clapping for a cease-fire—[inaudible].
The President. No, don't—don't—look——
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
Ms. Rosenberg. Cease-fire now!
The President. No, no, no, no, no. No, it's okay. It's okay.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. It's okay. I under—I under—don't—just let her stay in.
[Ms. Rosenberg began to sing as follows.]
Ms. Rosenberg. Cease-fire now. Cease-fire now. Cease-fire now.
The President. Well, but what happened was, we ended up, when those folks came out of the woods, like I said——
[Ms. Rosenberg continued to sing.]
Ms. Rosenberg. Cease-fire now. If you care about life, sing with me. Cease-fire now. Cease-fire now. Cease-fire now.
[Ms. Rosenberg was escorted out of the event by security personnel.]
The President. Well, I understand her emotion. I really do.
And you know, I've—I'm going to say something that's both revealing and self-serving at the same time. I'm the guy that convinced Bibi to call for that cease-fire to let the prisoners out. I'm the guy that spent all the time talking to Elsisi to let him open the door into Egypt. I'm the guy who spent—[applause]. And I've met—and I've met with the war cabinet. I met with—and I'm one of these guys—from the very beginning, I was—for what it's worth, I was raised by what the Jews call a righteous Christian: my dad.
My dad was one of those guys who came home from work and would, before he went back to close the shop, my dad would talk about how we had—how—he didn't understand why we didn't bomb the railroad tracks into the concentration camps. My dad couldn't understand why the Jews in that boat were not allowed in. My dad talked about silence being complicity. My dad was one of those guys who was that—just that kind of man.
And you know, I learned from him. Matter of fact, you know, silence is complicity. And the fact of the matter is, from the time each of my children and grandchildren reached the age of 14, the first thing I did on their 14th birthdays—I put them on a plane, and I took them to Dachau one at a time—one at a time. Because I wanted them to see.
You walk through that gate in Dachau, saying it will ""set you free."" But the beautiful homes all along that fence line—the idea no one could have lived there and not known what was happening. Silence is complicity. I wanted them to understand they had to speak up.
But, folks, this is incredibly complicated for the Israelis. And it's incredibly complicated for the Muslim world as well. I support a two-state solution, and I have from the very beginning. But I can thoroughly understand the emotions, both on the Palestinian side of this argument and on the Jewish side of the argument.
But, folks, do—the fact of the matter is that Hamas is a terrorist organization, a flat-out terrorist organization.
And, well, I'm—I better talk about what I was going to talk about. [Laughter]
But the point is that, you know, when those folks came out of those woods, I knew I couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore. I really mean it. Because the President of the United States had just drawn a moral equivalence between those who stood for hate and those who stood against hate. That's what he did back when—in Charlottesville.
You see, I really do believe, as my father taught me, silence is complicity. And I wasn't going to be silent. So I ran.
And I'll just tell you—I hadn't planned this. I'm keeping you too long. But I decided I had to run, but then I was worried. I was a professor at a university and these two institutes.
And I had grandchildren, who, their whole lives—my son, my daughter—my living son, my living daughter, and—and my granddaughters, who were then in—one was in college at Columbia Law School. My other—I had two more at the University of Pennsylvania, and two who were in high school. And I knew it was going to be an ugly campaign.
So I—and we have a tradition of my family—I know it's going to sound strange, but maybe some of you do as well—from my dad's time. Any child can ask for a family meeting—not a joke—can ask for a family meeting if they have something important they want to talk about it. And it's honored.
So I got a phone call from my granddaughter Naomi, named after my deceased daughter, who I lost in that automobile crash. And she said, ""We want to have a family meeting, Pop."" And they came down, and they said, you know, ""Daddy wants you to run,"" et cetera. And they made the case.
And they said, ""We know it's going to be ugly."" And my little grandson, who's now in high school—a senior in high school—junior in high school—he took out his cell phone. And there was a picture of my deceased son's casket coming out with military honors. He was a major—Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal—in the United States military, and a year in Iraq.
And I had my hand on the coffin, and my hand under little—his name is Hunter, named after his uncle. And I had my hand under his chin like I used to hold Beau—like this—when I'd walk with him. And the caption said, ""Biden molests another child.""
And they said, ""We know it's going to be mean, Pop, but you've got to do it."" And that's why I—and I did. Because I ran because I thought everything in this country—what it stood for, what we believed in, everything that made America ""America,"" our very democracy—was at risk.
And I believed that in 2020, and I wrote about that. I made the first speech I made about that.
And we're the only nation founded on idea. Every other nation is founded based on ethnicity, religion, or—we're the only one based on an idea. And that is: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator.""
Well, guess what? We've never fully met it, but we've never walked away from it. We've never walked away from that notion. And now we're not going to walk away on my watch.
I think I thought—so I made that speech at Independence Hall and then later at Gettysburg. I—people thought that I was being hyperbolic at the time. ""Joe, what do you mean democracy is at risk? What do you mean we're in a battle for the soul of America?""
Well, people don't say that anymore about me. People don't anymore doubt that democracy in 2020 was at risk. Well, I think the same the case is now—in this upcoming election. It's still at risk.
Kamala and I are running because we made progress, but our democracy is still at stake. Because, folks, the same man who thought there were ""very fine people on both sides,"" who called Hizballah ""very smart,"" who recently on more than one occasion has made a joke about the assault on Speaker Pelosi's husband with a hammer when he was struck in the head.
Now, there are a lot of reasons Donald Trump shouldn't be President, but my—but the one that I think demonstrates the best reason of all is: Our democracy is at stake.
Folks, Kamala and I are asking the entire nation to join us in sending the strongest, clearest, most powerful message that political violence in America is never, never, never, never—never justified.
And Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy this democracy. And while the MAGA Republicans in the House have been fighting among themselves, struggling to elect a Speaker, trying to shut down the Government, sowing seeds of destruction at every turn, Kamala and I are always going to defend, protect, and fight for that democracy.
That's why we're running again. That's the God's truth.
This country we live in is so special. Kamala and I don't believe America is a dark and negative nation, a nation of carnage, driven by anger, fear, and revenge.
But my opponent—likely opponent does. To his supporters, he says, quote, ""I am your retribution."" He said we are a ""failing nation."" These are his quotes. Every—""Either they win or we win. And if they win, we no longer have a country.""
Did you ever think you'd hear nominee for President say those things, or a former President?
I believe we are a hopeful, optimistic, and—driven by a simple proposition that everybody deserves a fair shot.
Folks, I think that's what's at stake. I think democracy is on the ballot. And indeed, we need every one of you—every American—every American who loves democracy to join together in 2024.
If we do that, we will have done something few generations get to do and get to say. We will have saved American democracy.
So, folks, together—together, folks, I know we can do this. I've never been more optimistic about our country. Think about it. I'm not joking. Think about the possibilities we have.
You know, can you think of any circumstance we've ever been in we've gotten in a serious problem and we haven't come out stronger than when we went in? I can't think of one time in American history, as a student of American history, where that's occurred.
We have to just remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity if we work together.
So I know I get criticized for wanting to work with the other team, but we have to unite this country. We must unite this country. Because I believe the vast majority of people believe that we have to do that.
And, folks, look, we're in a situation where, if you think about it, we're on the—we're—we've been able to pull together Europe and NATO in a way it's never been pulled together. Not a joke. It's there. We're moving in the direction—and Asia is a hell of a lot more united. I was able to get Japan and South Korea to finally agree after the end of World War II. They're—they understand their security rests upon whether Putin wins in Ukraine or not. They're engaged.
We're in a situation where, if you think about it, we have—an opportunity exists in Latin America to change the dynamic.
We should be the most democratic hemisphere in the world. But we're—we have a lot more to do. We're—just have to—we have a—we have a chance to change it. We have a chance to change so much for the better if we just decide that—what we're for, who we are.
And I just think that—I hope I'm up to the task of making sure that we make these united efforts.
My mother used to say, ""Joey, out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it."" Well, a lot bad has happened, but I think there's so much that we can do.
So I want to tell you, I am optimistic. But I'm not optimistic because I'm naive. I have more experience than any President has in the history of United States. One of the things that comes with age, hopefully, is wisdom.
And I think we have—and here's the concluding point I'll make. Madeleine Albright wrote a book about the United States being the essential nation—we, the United States. I promise you, that's true.
The rest of the world is looking to the United States to be the organizational structure for an organized and democratic world. We have a chance to do it. So many nations are looking to us. And we can do it without engaging American troops or forces. We can do so much. But we have to maintain the democratic instincts we have.
I'll conclude by saying to that, you know, when I—when I convinced Strom Thurmond—[laughter]—no, I mean it—mean it sincerely—before on his—before he died to vote for the extension of the Voting Rights Act. Strom Thurmond. Strom Thurmond. [Laughter]
I thought, you know, you can—you can—you can defeat hate. You can bury it. But you can never kill it off. All it does is hide under rocks, until it gets some oxygen breathed under those rocks that brings it back out.
That's where we are now. We have to fight back. We have to fight back and make clear that we are the essential nation, we understand our role, and we can organize better than any other nation in the world a consensus on promoting democracy, not killing.
And so, folks, I really think that we have an enormous opportunity. But we have to step up. And we are. And all of you have allowed me to do that.
And I just warn you: If I'm reelected, I'm not going to change a whole lot—[laughter]—I think, because we have to unite the country.
When I ran the first time, I said I was running for three—three reasons, and even my own team thought I was maybe wrong for saying it. The one was I said we had to restore the soul of America, the sense of decency and honor in who we are.
And secondly—secondly—we had to understand that we were going to bring the country together. We had to unite the country again. And the press understandably said: ""Well, that used to be—when Biden was in Senate, he was good at that. But that's beyond the capacity to be done anymore.""
And the third thing I said was, we had to rebuild America from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Because when that occurs, the poor have a chance, and the wealthy do very well.
I still believe those three things.
And I think what we've done legislatively at the outset has thus far been pretty impressive. It's going to take time for people understand all that's happened.
But in the meantime, we just have to—the rest of the world is looking to us. I promise you.
I've known almost every major head of state for the last 25 years. I've met with over 140 countries. I understand: Everywhere I go, if I walk in a room—not because of Joe Biden, because I'm President of the United States of America—they're looking to us. They're looking to us.
And there are answers. There are answers that we can afford and make better for everyone, but—[inaudible]—for the United States of America.
Sorry to ramble on with you all so much. But God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you.""        Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Minneapolis, Minnesota"

Well, Mr. President, it's good to see you again.

We were just talking about the last time we saw each other—when I was Vice President—down in the Dominican Republic. I guess that was in 2017?

President Abinader. Yes. That was when you visited the Dominican Republic.

President Biden. Yes.

And look, the friendship between our countries runs deep, strengthened by generations of Dominicans who have become American citizens. They've got a population here that's real.

And the partnership between our nations is, I think, stronger than ever before——

President Abinader. Yes.

President Biden. ——in large part because of your leadership.

President Abinader. Thank you.

President Biden. And together, we're expanding opportunities for working people in both our nations, I believe, and—including through our American Partnership for Economic Prosperity.

And we're standing side by side to counter corruption. You've been leading on that, and I appreciate that. And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership on what was, in fact, and always has been an issue in the region.

And you know, finally, we're working together to address the historic humanitarian and security situation in Haiti. As I said at the U.N. General Assembly, the people of Haiti cannot wait. And together, we're going to continue to support the Kenyan-led multinational mission.

And we're going to continue to urge Haitian political actors to come together for the good of their country.

So, Mr. President, I want to thank you again for making the effort to be here. And I look forward to our conversations today about issues that are extremely important for our relationship and the region. And so thank you for being here.

President Abinader. Thank you, President Biden. I agree with you that the relation with the United States now is better than ever. And we are—thank you very much for hosting this association for American partnership for economic development with other countries of Latin America.

The Dominican people are your friends, the Dominican people are your allies, and the Dominican people are your partners. As you know, we have more than 2 million Dominican descendants in the United States, which we are very grateful forever of receiving them, and they are also great citizens of this country.

President Biden. They are.

President Abinader. We share your commitments to strengthen security, democracy, and human rights. We are partners in defending democracy in the region.

And in order to achieve this goal, we must increase, President Biden, and spread prosperity and deliver the fruits of democracy to all our people.

We are firmly committed to fight against illegal drugs and corruption. Any country cannot develop with corruption. And we are fighting corruption, as you already stated, as never before in our country.

And these goals can be better accomplished if we do it through constructive cooperation.

President Biden. I agree.

President Abinader. The Dominican people are very proud of our economic recovery, which depends to a considerable degree on U.S. trade and tourism. We will continue to work hard to build an even brighter future for all our people.

Mr. President, we look forward to welcoming you soon to the Dominican Republic at the next Summit of the Americas in 2025, where we will continue to develop the bonds of prosperity, security, and democracy that bind us together. And that summit will be in Punta Cana, so you have time to be on the beach.

Thank you.

President Biden. Thank you very much.

President Abinader. Thank you, President.

Well, Mr. President, welcome to the White House. Welcome to the Oval Office.
President Boric. Thank you very much. It's really an honor for me and for Chile to be here.
President Biden. Well, I tell you, it's our honor.
Look, you know, the only problem I have with you is, you're too young. [Laughter]
President Boric. That's not a problem. [Laughter]
President Biden. No, what—it was—I got elected when I was 29. You had to be 30 years old to be a Senator. I had to wait. President—that's pretty good, man.
President Boric. Well——
President Biden. That's why I called you.
President Boric. I was elected when I was 35, and 27 for Congress.
President Biden. That's right.
President Boric. You were elected at 29, you said?
President Biden. Twenty-nine.
President Boric. Twenty-nine.
President Biden. You have to be 30. I had to wait 17 days to be eligible.
President Boric. Well, we are sharing the same path then.
President Biden. Yes. But anyway——
President Boric. Hope to get as far as you.
President Biden. Well, it's great to have you here and have you—to see you again.
You know, this year, Chile and the United States celebrate 200 years—200 years—of bilateral relations. And today, our—I think our partnership is stronger than it's ever been.
President Boric. Yes.
President Biden. And one of the things that—together, through our Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, we're going to grow the economies, the hemisphere from the bottom up and the middle out.
You know, we—I've said many times that there's no reason why this hemisphere shouldn't be the most prosperous, most democratic hemisphere in the world. We have all the makings of that, and we're standing up for democracy and freedom, human rights, and the rights of workers. I know we share those views, you and I.
And together, we're working to address the historic levels of migration in the hemisphere, a lot of people moving around. And I admire the way you've handled it, particularly the Venezuelan refugees, which you've set an example for the region.
And so, as we embark on this next century of partnership, let's make it even stronger.
President Boric. Well, that's why I'm here for. Thank you for receiving me and my delegation.
We're celebrating 200 years of diplomatic relationships, but also 20 years since our free trade agreement, which has bring a lot of benefits for both of us. I'm looking forward to strengthen our relationships.
And I'm glad to be here also to the American Partnership, the APEP meeting. Hope we can talk on that.
And, well, we have some—a lot of values that we share: of course, the preoccupation for human rights, democracy, and also the rights of the workers in the world. I saw you supporting workers here in the States in—a couple—a couple of weeks ago. And I think that's very valuable from—from a President.
And, well, we have a lot of topics to discuss: the green transition, of course; immigration, migration; the economic development; and of course, some issues that are going on in this world that it's really hard nowadays. But I know with respecting human rights and fighting for democracy, we can reach some of the goals we share.
President Biden. Well, you know, we—in my view, there comes a time, maybe every six to eight generations, where the world changes in a very short time. And——
President Boric. We're at that time now.
President Biden. We are. And I think what happens in the next 2, 3 years are going to determine what the world looks like for the next five or six decades. And so, together, maybe we can make it better.
President Boric. Let's work for it.

"Nov 03, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-americas-partnership-for-economic-prosperity-leaders-summit,Remarks at the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity Leaders Summit,"""The President. Good morning, everyone.
I'm honored to welcome all of you to the White House. I really are—am honored to have you here for the inaugural leaders meeting of the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.
Last year, in Los Angeles at the Summit of the Americas, we launched an agenda for cooperation, common purpose, and transformative ideals to better deliver for the people all across and up and down our region.
One key outcome of the summit was this partnership and 12 countries committing to drive innovative approaches to shared challenges. To grow our economies from the bottom up and the middle out, because when that—when we do it that way, everyone does well. The wealthy do just fine, but we—the middle class and working class people have a shot. And to increase opportunity and decrease inequity, to harness the incredible economic potential of the Americas, and to make the Western Hemisphere the most economically competitive region in the world. I think that's totally within our reach.
Over the last year and a half, everyone has stepped up, and we've stepped up together. And the initiatives we are announcing today speak to the progress we've already made and the potential of the Americas Partnership going forward.
First, we're doubling down on mobilizing financial solutions in the Americas. The United States is already the largest source of investment across Latin America and the Caribbean by far. And we want to make sure that our closest neighbors know they have a real choice between debt-trap diplomacy and high-quality, transparent approaches to infrastructure and to development.
So the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank are launching a new investment platform to channel billions of dollars toward building sustainable infrastructure in the hemisphere and strengthening the critical supply chains. Modern ports, clean energy grids, digital infrastructure—these are the building blocks—the building blocks to—for a competitive and resilient economy. And by combining the commitment of the United States Government to mitigate investment risk with the agility of private-sector financing, we believe we can deliver gains for workers and families throughout the region.
The United States is also working with the Inter-American Development Bank to establish a Fund for Nature to seed more investment in nature-based climate solutions like debt-for-nature swaps and blue and green bonds. I supported a debt-for-nature swaps dating back to my time in the United States Senate, and this is a ripe area for considerable growth in my view. Investors are eager to support projects that are—with demonstrated potential.
And, by providing early-stage funding [and; White House correction] the technical assistance, we will help more promising climate solutions get off the ground than ever before. We can support more projects like trailblazing deal we saw earlier this year restructuring Ecuador's international debt within—and will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in marine conservation work around the Galapagos Islands.
The second thing we're doing: We're investing in our people in each of our countries. All across the region, entrepreneurs are ready to break out. Investors are changing the way we think. And workers are ready to roll up their sleeves. And we're going to make sure they have the skills and the resources they need in order to succeed.
Today we're launching the Americas Partnership Accelerator, a multiyear program to help promising entrepreneurs develop and fund their ideas. This is an example of what we can deliver when we work together.
Canada is joining the United States with funding to launch the Accelerator, and Uruguay is leading the creation of an angel investor network, individuals who mobilize venture capital from around the world to support the Accelerator.
I think Prime Minister Trudeau and President—and I think Prime Minister Trudeau and President Lacalle are also—and I also think President Chaves for—I want to thank them for committing to establish a new regional Center of Excellence in Costa Rica. The center will provide educational training that's going to help equip workers in the hemisphere to lead in the digital economy—the digital economy of the future—working in fields like cybersecurity and semiconductor manufacturing.
And President Boric, we—I want to thank you for committing Chile to lead new initiatives to build our regional space industry so we can better harness satellite technology and tackle vital issues, from climate change to food insecurity.
And finally, we're affirming our regionwide approach to sharing responsibility for managing the challenges of unprecedented migration flows. With the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, we committed to work together to address the historic levels of migration impacting all—all—of our countries.
Our shared approach has three key parts. One, working together to stabilize migrant populations, including making sure the communities that are welcoming migrants and refugees can afford—can afford—to welcome them and afford to care for them. And two, as part of that commitment, the United States and Canada and Spain are contributing to the Inter-American Development Bank's Migration Grant Facility to help countries that are approaching—that are providing migrants with legal status, supporting the critical services necessary for communities to live in safety and, maybe most importantly, in—with dignity.
Second thing we're doing: expanding legal pathways to promise—to promote safe and orderly migration, providing worker permits to allow migrants to contribute to our economy. This is a critical asset and—to all of our countries.
And three, enforcing our immigration laws in humane and effective ways that deter—that deters dangerous, irregular migration and disrupts traffickers.
I've asked the United States Congress for supplemental funds to carry out this three-part strategy in our country, and I urge them to act quickly.
So let me close with this. Our region is forever knit together by the close bonds of family and enduring friendship. The United States—it is not hyperbole to suggest—is shaped by the rich contributions of people from all across this region. We are a country of immigrants. More than 63 million Latinos and millions more with roots in the Caribbean are strengthening communities all across the United States of America, and it's a big deal.
The United States currently has the fourth largest Spanish-speaking population in the world. About a quarter of the children in our public schools today are Hispanic.
In each of our countries, our people are young and dynamic and diverse, poised to seize the future. And I think they really are. All we need to do is keep going, keep delivering on the positive vision we all share for a region that is secure, prosperous, and democratic, from Canada's northernmost reaches to the southern tip of Chile.
And I hope you share my view as we look forward to the next leaders meeting in Costa Rica in 2025. I want to thank you for all carrying our momentum forward. President Chaves, thank you. And at the—at that meeting, I hope to see more countries from the region join us as we seek to expand this partnership.
Thanks again for everyone around this table. We've got a lot of work to do. Your partnership and your leadership is important. And we're going to accomplish an awful lot, God willing, in the next few years.
And I know—I'll ask the press now to depart, which they always love hearing, so we can get down to business.
So thank you very, very much.

The President then began his remarks.]
The President. Hello, UAW! Hello, hello, hello.
Something you don't know: My State of Delaware—a little State—because we've got a small population, had the highest percentage of UAW workers in the United States of America. We had the largest GM plant. We had the largest Chrysler plant outside of Detroit. And we had a lot of shipping as well.
But here's the deal, I got raised on automobiles. My dad ran an automobile—he didn't own it; he ran an automobile agency for a long time.
Audience member. President Biden, you need to call for a cease-fire in Gaza! Ten thousand——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Okay. No, no, no, let—let her go.
[At this point, the audience disruption continued.]
Let it—no.
[The audience disruption continued.]
Audience member. Get her out!
The President. No, don't. Let it—it's okay.
Audience member. We love you, Joe! We love you, Joe! We love you, Joe!
The President. Anyway——
Audience members. We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe!
The President. Look, I guess what I'm trying to say to you is, I grew up in neighborhoods where I know what it likes when a plant closes down. The largest General Motors plant, as I said; the largest Chrysler plant—when they shut down, people lost their sense of pride. Neighborhoods were in real trouble. People wondered whether they were going to stick around, what was going to happen to their families. It's a big, big deal.
So this opening in Belvidere, again, is a gigantic deal, as far as I'm concerned.
Matt, the UAW in Boone County is lucky to have you, pal.
It's good to be in Illinois with so many friends.
And, Gov, you've done one hell of a job. You worked so darn hard to get jobs back here in Belvidere. And by the way, you don't want to be on the other side of this guy. [Laughter] He knows what he's doing.
And two Members are here from the outstanding congressional delegation, Bill Foster and Eric Sorensen. Bill, where are you? There they are.
Audience member. Representative Vella!
The President. And Representative Vella. [Laughter]
Audience member. We love Vella!
The President. Didn't know he was here.
Audience member. He's here.
Audience member. Dave's here.
The President. And look, one of your great—where are you?
State Representative Dave Vella of Illinois. Right over here.
The President. I'm sorry, man.
And two of your great Senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, can't be here because they're in Washington voting. But I—they had to stay back. And by the way, they fight tirelessly for the people of Illinois, and Durbin busted his neck in this job too, as well.
Look, folks, they've worked nonstop to bring good jobs back to Belvidere.
Two people—two people from my team are here who did so much to support UAW negotiations: our Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su—where are you, Julie?—and Gene Sperling. I think—I think Shawn—[applause]. I think Shawn would tell you they did a hell of a job.
And thank you to all the State and local leaders here today.
But, most of all, to the members of the UAW—you're tough, tough, tough as they come. The first outfit to ever endorse me as a 29-year-old kid when I was running for the United State Senate and been with me my whole career.
You know, the fact is, this starts at the top, though, with Shawn Fain. Shawn, you've done one hell of a job, pal. When I called Shawn to congratulate him on this historic deals with the Big Three automakers, he said the credit goes to all of you—all of you out there, and it does.
And it may be true, but it doesn't hurt to have a leader with a backbone like a ramrod, and that's Shawn.
You know, he and the entire UAW proved what I've always believed: Wall Street didn't build America. The middle——
Audience members. No!
The President. The middle class built America——
Audience members. Yes!
The President. ——and unions built the middle class.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. That was true in the 20th century, and it's still true today. And Americans know it. That's why unions are more popular today than they've been in decades.
About 6 weeks ago, I went to Belvidere, Michigan—excuse me, Belleville, Michigan—to join your brothers and sisters on the picket line. It brought back a lot memories of my marching on picket lines as a United States Senator. But what I didn't realize: It was the first time a President ever did that. [Laughter]
It was second nature. No, I'm serious. I didn't know that.
Audience member. That shirt looks good on you!
The President. Well, I tell you——
Audience members. Yeah!
The President. I've worn this shirt a lot, man. You have no idea. I've been involved with the UAW longer than you were alive, man. [Laughter]
Look, that day in Michigan, I said the auto strike was about a simple proposition. You guys sacrificed to save the automobile industry from the—in the middle of the——
Audience member. Yes!
The President. No, you—that's a fact. You did. Some of you weren't around; you were too young. [Laughter] But you—I mean it. But—the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
And now, the auto companies are doing incredibly well. So auto workers should be doing incredibly well as well. You saved the auto industry, and they should step up for you.
A simple proposition: You kept the picket line going for 46 days. You kept your negotiations working around the clock—negotiators. And in the end, the deal you reached set a new standard.
Over 30-percent increase in wages, with cost-of-living adjustments; bigger pay increases over the last—next 4½ years than in the last 22 years combined; greater retirement security; more paid leave; and community by—commitments by the Big Three to create thousands more full-time, middle class jobs, investing tens of billions of dollars building the auto future made in America.
Look, folks, these deals are gamechangers not only for UAW workers, but for all workers in America. Just ask the folks at Toyota, which last week announced it would significantly, finally increase wages for their workers.
Thanks for—you had no choice—they had no choice because of what you put—did. You helped everybody. And look, I—and I want to thank you for your commitment to the solidarity, for exercising your right to bargain collectively. You made this happen.
Audience member. Thanks.
The President. And it's no—no, by the way, it's a bigger thing, I think, than even you all realize. You've changed—you're changing the face of the country economically.
I also want to recognize Ford, GM, and Stellantis. They negotiated, ultimately, in good faith. And, as a result, auto workers will be rewarded and the iconic Big Three are going to still lead the world in quality and innovation because of you.
Look—but I'm a little selfish. I want this type of contract for all auto workers. And I have a feeling UAW has a plan for that. The future of the automobile industry will be made in America by American union workers.
And I see the future here in Belvidere. The Belvidere Assembly Plant was the beating heart of this community for nearly six decades, just like it was back in Delaware, where I was raised. Eight months ago, the plant idled indefinitely. One thousand two hundred of you lost jobs.
When that happens, the community loses more than jobs. They lose their sense of pride, lose their sense of being, lose their sense of dignity. You've got to—what do you turn and say to your kids? What do you say to one another? Everything changes. It's devastating.
Then, this June, I had a combination with Matt about the local—from the local UAW, as he just described. I said, ""Tell me, what's going on in—with Belvidere?"" He told me how critical it was to get that plant up and on line again.
So I told my team, ""Make Stellantis know Belvidere is a priority."" And I got on the phone and let them know personally I thought it was a priority.
Audience member. Yeah.
Audience member. Thank you, Joe!
The President. I can—[applause]. No, no, no.
By the way, I can't take a lot of credit for that. But I watched it before. I've watched it as a kid. I watched it as a Senator. I watched what happened in my community. It changed everything. The State had a lot of other things going, but those folks were hurt badly.
I can tell you one thing, it was a priority—it was my priority for you as well as a priority for all of you. That's why I personally brought it up with Mark Stewart, the head of the North American Stellantis.
Meanwhile, the UAW fought like hell to get these jobs back. And now you've secured nearly $5 billion in new investment to bring thousands of jobs back to Belvidere. They'll reopen that plant assembly; build mid-sized trucks, a state-of-the-art battery factory, and a parts distribution center right here in Belvidere.
And, folks, I'm fighting for places like Belvidere because I came to the Presidency determined to put an end to this trickle-down economics in this country. I mean it. I'm serious. I'm deadly earnest.
For too long, the wealthy and big corporations have done just fine, but the rest of us were cut out of that deal.
Look, I see it differently. I don't look at the economy through the eyes of Wall Street or Park Avenue. I look at it through the eyes of the people I grew up with in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware.
My guess is, that's how Shawn looks at it too—the people he grew up with in Kokomo.
Look, that view is that American workers are ready to work harder than anybody else. But they just need to be given a shot—a fair shot and a fair wage. That's not too much to ask.
[An audience member fell down.]
You okay? [Laughter] I want the press to know that wasn't me. [Laughter]
You know, my dad used to have a saying, for real. He'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity.""
Audience member. Yeah!
The President. ""It's about""—no, it really is.
""It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to go home and to look at your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it.""
Well, guess what? That's exactly what's happening in Belvidere again.
With this UAW contract, you'll be treated fairly. You'll get a fair share of what you produce. And you'll get the dignity and respect you deserve, right here, at home—and I know maybe the press won't get this, but you all who are members of the union will get it—and to be able to look your kid in the eye and say, ""Honey, it's going to be okay."" It matters.
I ran for President to big—bring back good-paying jobs that you can raise a family on, whether or not you went to college, and give working families more breathing room. And the way to do that is to invest in ourselves again, invest in America, invest in American workers. And that's exactly what we've done.
Folks, since I took office, our Nation has invested billions to supercharge advanced manufacturing here at home, including electric vehicles.
China is determined to dominate the electric-vehicle market by using unfair trade practices, but I will not let them. I promise you. [Applause] I mean it.
Look, let me give you an example: America invented the semiconductor, those little computer chips about the size of the tip of your little finger; they power everything in our lives, from cell phones to refrigerators to automobiles. As many as 3,000 are in a single electric vehicle.
And over as—over time, we went from producing 40—we invented the damn chips. [Laughter] No, we did. We invented them here in America. We used to present—we used to produce 40 percent of them; now we're down to 10 percent.
We saw what happened in the pandemic when we couldn't get those chips. Remember? The—people didn't know what the hell ""supply chain"" meant. We all know what ""supply chain"" means now, don't we? [Laughter] Well, I was determined that no supply chain was ever going to deny us, because it's going to start here in America—the supply chain. [Applause] No, I really mean it.
I literally went around the world convincing chip manufacturers in other parts of the world to come and invest in America. And the end result is, companies around the world are investing $200 billion to increase chip production.
And by the way, they're going to produce a whole hell of a lot of jobs too. You know those ""fabs,"" they call them—the factories they build, like the one they're building in east—west of Columbus, Ohio? Guess what? They employ thousands of people. And you know what the average wage in there is? A hundred and twelve thousand dollars, and you don't need a college degree.
And then I kept talking about science. How can you be the leading country without investing in science and research? And because of the CHIPS and Science Act, which I put together and signed into law, the United States is going to invest—the Government—invest another $50 billion to manufacture these semiconductors at home. Now we'll be able to ensure that we have a supply chain in the Nation that we can rely on.
Then, thanks to bipartisan infrastructure law, which is over a trillion dollars—guess what?—we're building a network of 500,000 electric-vehicle charging stations all across America by your brothers and sisters, the IBEW. And that's a first-rate outfit, that.
These charging stations will be easy to find and reliable as any gas station. You'll be able to travel across the Nation.
Then, we had a thing called the Inflation Reduction Act, which I put together—which, I might add, not one guy on the other team voted for—and that law has driven nearly $100 billion in investment in electric vehicles and EV batteries here at home.
And my administration announced a—$12 billion to convert the existing auto factories to manufacture electric vehicles, if they—in the transition.
Because I strongly believe that when a company transitions to a new technology, they should retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories with the same workers in the same community that existed there before. They should get the first shot at the jobs.
That's what you made happen here in Belvidere, and it should happen all across America.
Let me tell you all the investments we're paying for—we're paying off.
Sales of electric vehicles here at home have tripled since I took office. Eighty percent of electric vehicles on the road today were made in America. And that means good-paying jobs for American autoworkers.
That also means—let's think about this: When my predecessor, the distinguished—anyway—[laughter].
Audience member. We know.
[The President made the sign of the cross.]
The President. [Laughter] When my predecessor was in office, six factories closed across the country. Tens of thousands of auto jobs were lost nationwide. And, on top of that, he was willing to cede the future of electric vehicles to China.
He said if America invested in electric vehicles, it would drive down wages. It would destroy jobs. It would spell the end of the American automobile industry. Well, like almost everything else he said, he was wrong. And you proved—you have proved him wrong.
Instead of lower wages, you won record gains. Instead of fewer jobs, you've won a commitment for thousands of more jobs. Instead of less involvement and investment, you encouraged American auto makers to invest $40 billion in the American auto industry, beginning now—$40 billion.
And they were going to—we were going to shut down, remember—my other guy?
And here's the difference: When you were in the middle of the fight, I stood and others stood with you, shoulder to shoulder, on that picket line. My predecessor went to a nonunion shop and attacked you.
Audience member. Yes, he did! Yes, he did!
The President. I hope you—I hope you guys have a memory. Where I come from, it matters. The truth is, if you had listened to him—[laughter]—thank God you didn't. [Laughter] If you had listened to him—look—and since—look, since I became President, thanks to the investments we've made in—more than 20 new auto plants have opened across America. Twenty new autos opened, not closed. And as a matter of fact, more are already on the way. And zero closed.
My administration will keep working to make sure UAW has what it needs to outcompete China and everyone else in the world. I've reminded other world leaders, it's never, never, never been a good bet to bet against America. It's never been a good—[applause]. Not a joke. Not a joke.
When we invest in America and Americans, we never lose. Look, it's been true through our history, and it's still true today.
Folks, you know what I knew growing up: For too long, the economy hasn't worked for working people and the middle class. And, again, that's why I'm determined to build an economy—to build from the middle out and the bottom up, instead of the top down. Not a whole lot trickled down to my dad's kitchen table from that trickle-down economics.
When we do that, we—the poor have a ladder up, the middle class does well, and the wealthy still do very well, even though they don't pay their taxes. [Laughter] No, they've got to be—start paying more tax—the corporate—[applause]. We all do well, and America prospers.
And the critical piece of growing the economy is worker power. I'm not just saying that. From an economic standpoint—it's worker power. You know the agreements forged by Shawn and the brothers and sisters of the UAW show how collective bargaining gives workers a seat at the table.
And when that happens, you ensure your wages and compensation honor your contributions, and your employers succeed as well. They don't lose, they succeed. They do better. They secure the pay and benefits you can raise a family on, retire with dignity.
And I might add, the deals you struck show how collective bargaining works for companies as well.
Look, the strong relationship between workers and management can mean record profits leading to record contracts. We're seeing it across the board, for UAW to rail workers, to port workers, to Teamsters, to health workers, to writers—did you see they settled the strike and—you guys are, really, a harbinger. They settled the strike in Los Angeles. Now you'll be able to see whatever the hell you want to see. [Laughter]
But look, it matters.
I asked the U.S. Department of Treasury to do a full-blown study to determine and—they recently released the report showing that—how unions are not just good for union workers but nonunion workers as well.
Audience member. Right. That's right.
The President. No, I—but everybody—for the longest time—the longest time—you know as well as I do—10 years ago, the reason we were in trouble is ""unions, unions."" It's the exact opposite.
Unions raise the standard across workplaces and industries, pushing up wages and strengthening benefits for everybody, whether you're a union member or not.
So let me close with this. Our economy has made strong gains since I came to office. We have the strongest economic growth and the lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the entire world.
We've got more to do. We've got more to do. But our economy grew—to bore you with a statistic—4.9 percent last year [quarter; White House correction]. That's the highest growth in 2 years.
More people are working today than ever in the United States of America—more. Unemployment has been under 4 percent for 21 straight months. That hadn't happened in a long time. Inflation has come down two-thirds since last summer, and it's going to come down more.
And wages are actually going up—not just in your industry, but wages are going up.
It's a fancy way of saying—is median household wealth has grown by 37 percent since the pandemic, meaning people are better off, 37-percent better off.
We have more to do, but we're finally building an economy that works for the people—working people, the middle class—and, as a consequence, the entire country.
When I look out at all of you and the communities like Belvidere, I see real heroes of your story—you know, you and the American worker, you're the American people.
Because of you, I can honestly say—and I mean this from the bottom of my heart—I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today. And I know I only look like I'm 30, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter] We have to just keep going.
Think this—think about this: Is there ever anything America set its mind to as a nation that we've done together that we haven't succeeded? Not a joke. Ever, anything.
Audience members. No, no.
The President. Well, you know, Donald Trump often says we're now—quote: ""We are now a failing nation. We're a nation in decline.""
Audience members. Boo!
The President. And by the way, the reason I'm mention it is, these MAGA Republicans—I don't know where they come from. [Laughter] No, I mean it sincerely.
But that's not what I see. I—like you, I know this country. I know what we can do if folks would give it half a chance.
That's why I'm so optimistic about our future. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity if we work together—[applause]—nothing, nothing, nothing. And you're making it happen.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.

Well, folks, I'm going to be signing a Presidential memorandum in just a minute here to establish the first-ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research.
It's an effort made possible by Jill, who's been a long champion of women's health, and Jen Klein, Dr. Mazure, Maria Shriver, and others.
Because the fact is that it requires all of Government—not just NIH, but HHS, the VA, the Defense Department, and every agency in the Government having anything to do with health—it requires them to come up with a report to me—for me that lays out what they can do collectively to improve women's health.
Women make up more than half the population. But for too long, they've been underrepresented when it comes to health research and the money spent on that research. That's going to change today.
So this—signing this, I'm setting up this group that within 45 days, all the Government agencies that have anything to do with health have to report on exactly what they're doing now with regard to women's health and the suggestions they may have on how to deal with it.
So let me sign now this and make it official, and then yield to Jill.
Well, let—Jill, let me yield to you first.
The First Lady. Thank you. [Laughter] I just want to say, Maria, I am so grateful to you——
Women's Alzheimer's Movement Founder Maria Shriver. Thank you.
The First Lady. ——for bringing this to our attention. And it's your leadership that's really going to make the difference and has made the difference already.
And also, thank you, Carolyn, for, you know, your involvement and your willingness to lead this effort.
And you know, Maria, after you came a couple of months ago, and then I spoke to Joe and—I have to say one of the things that I love most about Joe is, you know, you take something to him, and he listens. And he did listen to us, and that's—and it's resulted in this memorandum.
So thank you, Joe. We appreciate this.
The President. Well—[laughter].
The First Lady. And women deserve better. And now we're going to get it. So thank you.
The President. You don't have to thank me. I didn't realize how much incongruity there was and how imbalanced it was. So, God willing, we're going to solve that.
All right.
[At this point, the President signed the memorandum.]
All right. Thank you all very much.
Q. Are you concerned about a shutdown, Mr. President? Are you concerned about a shutdown, Mr. President?
[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]
Federal Government Funding 
Q. Mr. President, what's your level on concern that there could be a shutdown at the end of this week?
The President. With regard to a potential shutdown, I understand that the new Speaker of the House has a proposal that's being negotiated with the minority leader of the House, and Senator Schumer and the Republican leader are also talking about it.
I don't know what the outcome is going to be. Apparently, there's a meeting today at 4 or 5 o'clock on the Rules Committee. And we'll see what happens.
Federal Government Funding 
Q. Would you veto the laddered CR?
The President. I'm not going to make a judgment on what I'd veto or what I'd sign. But let's wait and see what they come up with.
[Several reporters asked questions at once.]
Q. Sir, any specific concerns—any specific concerns about the hospitals in Gaza, sir? Have you urged Israel to take any specific precautions on the hospitals in Gaza?
The President. Well, I—no, I——
White House Press Assistant Davis B. Conger. [Inaudible]—thank you very much.
Q. The President is going to answer it, Davis.
The First Lady. The hospital in Gaza, Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News] was asking.
Gaza Conflict/Israel Military Operations/Al Shifa Hospital 
Q. The hospitals in Gaza—have you expressed any specific concerns to Israel on that, sir?
The President. Well, you know I have not been reluctant in expressing my concerns what's going on. And it is my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action relative to the hospital. We're in contact, and we're—with the Israelis.
Also, there is an effort to take this pause to deal the release of prisoners, and that's being negotiated as well, with the Qataris engaged, and so I remain somewhat hopeful. But the hospital must be protected.""        Remarks on Signing a Memorandum Establishing the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research and an Exchange With Reporters"
"Nov 13, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-president-joko-jokowi-widodo-indonesia,"Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo of Indonesia","""President Biden. Mr. President, welcome. Welcome to the White House.
We've spent a lot of time together over the last several years, and it's really wonderful that you're here. I'm grateful for the hospitality you showed me in Bali, and we're delighted to have you here.
Today we're talking about taking our relationship to launching the highest possible level of cooperation: a comprehensive strategic partnership.
This will mark a new era between our—in the relationships between the United States and—and Indonesia across the board, affecting everything. It includes enhancing security cooperation, particularly maritime security. And it includes expanding our work together to build a secure and resilient supply chain. It includes deepening our collaboration to combat the climate crisis.
You know, I've told you this before, but Indonesia is a critical player—critical in the clean energy transition world.
And we're also going to continue to work with ASEAN to advance a free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. And I want to thank you—and I mean this sincerely—I want to thank you for your leadership on ASEAN this year. I really do.
As we mark nearly 75 years of cooperation between our nations, I'm of the view our partnership is stronger than it's ever been and is going to even get stronger. I'm looking forward to our conversation today and to our cooperation with APEC summit in San Francisco later this week.
As we say—used to say in the place that I worked a long time, the United States Senate, I yield the floor to my friend.
President Widodo. It is an honor for me to fulfill the invitation from President Biden to visit Washington, DC.
The U.S. is one of the most important partners for Indonesia. And we agreed to elevate our partnership into comprehensive strategic partnership. But most importantly, we have to give a real meaning to it.
For Indonesia, economic cooperation is priority, including on supply chains issues.
Indonesia also wishes our partnership contribute to regional and global peace and prosperity. So Indonesia appeals to the U.S. to do more to stop the atrocities in Gaza. Cease-fire is a must for the sake of humanity.
Once again, thank you for your invitation, President Biden. Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you.
And as we met outside as you got out of your automobile, we had a very important discussion on climate. The President said, ""I'm cold."" [Laughter] I told him I could take care of that immediately. [Laughter]
Welcome.
President Widodo. Thank you, President Biden.
President Biden. Thank you all so much.
President Widodo. Thank you. Thank you.""	Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo of Indonesia"
"Nov 13, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-president-joko-jokowi-widodo-indonesia,"Joint Statement by President Biden and President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo of Indonesia","""President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. is honored to welcome Indonesian President Joko Widodo to Washington, D.C. The two leaders mark a historic new phase of bilateral cooperation and friendship between the world's second- and third-largest democracies. On the cusp of celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations and recognizing the two nations' shared values of democracy and pluralism and common commitment to the rules-based international order, President Biden and President Widodo commit to elevate the U.S.-Indonesia relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
In the eight years since establishing the U.S.-Indonesia Strategic Partnership, the two countries have made remarkable strides in increasing mutual understanding and trust and strengthening cooperation. Under the elevated framework of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, President Biden and President Widodo intend to further expand cooperation on all issues of common concern, including good governance; pluralism; and respect for human rights, the rule of law, sovereignty, sustainable development, and territorial integrity. The United States and Indonesia intend to remain deep friends and close partners, working hand-in-hand to deliver a better future for our citizens and tackle the emerging challenges of the twenty-first century.
Promoting Inclusive Economic Growth through Innovation, Sustainable Development, Public Health, and Digital Transformation 
The two leaders reaffirm the importance of innovation-driven, inclusive economic growth as a core pillar of our efforts to deliver better lives and livelihoods for the American and Indonesian people. Both sides plan to work together to boost bilateral trade and deepen cooperation on economic policy, including through the U.S.-Indonesia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) and other platforms, and by preparing regulatory measures in an open and transparent manner.
President Widodo and President Biden express firm intent to support market-based economic reforms that promote decent work, social justice, freedom of association, and collective bargaining, and affirm broad, supportive, and constructive bilateral engagement to ensure a trade and investment relationship that is built upon high standards. The leaders look forward to further engagement and progress under the U.S.-Indonesia TIFA, which provides an important opportunity for the United States and Indonesia to work together on a range of issues, including trade in services, intellectual property, labor, investment, agricultural and industrial goods, and to facilitate exchange and dialogue among relevant stakeholders.
President Biden expresses his support for Indonesia initiating the accession process to become a full member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Corresponding to the commencement of this process, the United States looks forward to working with all OECD members to ensure Indonesia is successful in fulfilling all its commitments in the OECD accession roadmap, including all necessary economic, trade, labor, and employment reforms.
The leaders pledge to continue strengthening a non-discriminatory, open, fair, inclusive, equitable, transparent, and rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core. In addition, both sides applaud the progress thus far and look forward to additional substantial progress under the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), which will deliver concrete benefits to the economies and workers of the two countries and the region.
President Biden and President Joko Widodo recognize Indonesia's global leadership in the nickel, cobalt, and other critical minerals value chains, the United States' significant critical mineral resources, and the Biden Administration's commitment to developing the full U.S. critical mineral supply chain. They emphasize the opportunity to create high-standard clean energy supply chain jobs in both countries through a robust partnership between the United States and Indonesia that leads to mutually beneficial development of domestic resources in accordance with fair market-based rules.
They commit to work together to reduce supply chain dependencies and vulnerabilities, promote supply chain transparency, and expand access to secure and sustainable critical minerals sources. They affirm the importance of strong worker and environmental protections to prevent exploitation and promote sustainability in the international mining sector.
They determine to take concrete steps to adopt and implement policies that advance occupational safety and health and fair wages and ensure employers uphold internationally recognized labor standards and comply with domestic labor law at each country's mining and processing facilities. They commit to work together to strengthen Indonesia's investment environment, including with technical assistance and capacity building resources, and to mobilize high-standard investment that will create healthy, safe, and decent work for Indonesians and Americans, while enhancing economic and energy security for both countries. They commit to working toward a low-greenhouse gas emissions mineral supply chain, including efforts to seek to promote clean and low-emission power for mineral processing.
To advance this work, they commit to develop a critical minerals action plan that encompasses all of these lines of effort and seeks to increase high standard investment in the critical minerals sectors in both countries. They commit to pursue these efforts with a view toward establishing the foundation to launch future negotiations on a critical minerals agreement.
The two leaders reaffirm their commitment to work together to build secure and resilient semiconductor supply chains in support of our respective national interests and in accordance with respective national legislations. With support from the International Technology Security and Innovation (ITSI) Fund, created by the U.S. CHIPS Act of 2022, the two leaders affirm to support the development of, and spur investment in, Indonesia's domestic semiconductor ecosystem, with a view to enhance local value creation, diversify global supply chains, and support U.S. industry. These initiatives aim to support Indonesia as a partner in the development of secure and trustworthy telecommunications networks to ensure a secure and diverse semiconductor supply chain.
The leaders reaffirm their commitment to sustainable development including on addressing poverty reduction and gender and income disparities, shoring up health systems, and facilitating inclusive economic growth. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Indonesia's Ministry of Environment and Forestry signed a new joint forest and wildlife conservation partnership agreement aimed at mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, safeguarding vulnerable species, adapting to the negative effects of climate change, and ensuring sustainable livelihoods for residents of forest communities. Furthermore, the United States and Indonesia plan to work together through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment and regional initiatives such as IPEF to mobilize public and private investment in infrastructure to support Indonesia's sustainable growth and decent work for all.
President Widodo welcomes continued collaboration with the United States on the development of Indonesia's new capital city, Nusantara. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) intends to fund a trade mission to the United States focused on the development of the new capital city to promote U.S. exports in quality, sustainable infrastructure and innovative smart-city solutions. USTDA also plans to fund training for Indonesian officials on value-based procurement for designing, evaluating, and awarding tenders for the new capital city. This work builds on USAID's ongoing technical assistance to the Nusantara New Capital Authority to develop smart building guidelines—the first of its kind in Indonesia. The U.S. Department of Commerce plans to organize a Smart City Business Development Mission to further strengthen trade and investment on smart city development in Indonesia.
The two leaders recognize important bilateral efforts to enhance cooperation in the health sector through increased research and technical collaboration, investment in human capital development, and the sharing of best practices. The leaders look forward to fostering greater collaboration across multiple health sectors, including through a planned five-year renewal of the memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Indonesia's Ministry of Health. Building on the two countries' long-standing partnership in combatting infectious disease, the leaders intend to further strengthen cooperation on pandemic preparedness, prevention, and response, particularly in vaccine delivery as well as the research and development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Both leaders reiterate their shared commitment to eradicating infectious diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, polio, Zika, tuberculosis, and dengue as well as strengthening prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases such as stroke, cancer, and heart disease. The United States welcomes and supports Indonesia's Declaration on Cervical Cancer Elimination through the National Cervical Cancer Elimination Plan (2023 to 2030) and the two governments reiterate their shared intent to eliminate the incidence of cervical cancer.
Powering the Clean Energy Transition 
Recognizing that the climate crisis poses an existential threat, the leaders reaffirm the two countries will pursue urgent actions in efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. They resolve to expand collaboration on clean and renewable energy production to accelerate the clean energy transition while working to ensure affordable, accessible, and transparent provision of clean energy for their citizens.
Indonesia and the United States will continue to closely collaborate, including with other partners, on the $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) to realize the accelerated deployment of renewable energy and the reduction of emissions in Indonesia within the agreed-upon timeline in the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP). President Biden applauds Indonesia's ambitious climate commitments under its JETP, including strong renewable energy deployment and power sector emissions goals. President Widodo welcomes U.S. contributions to the JETP and looks forward to further efforts to deliver public and private financing for Indonesia's clean energy transition. Indonesia welcomes future projects funded by international financial institutions in the areas of climate change response, energy transition, green growth, and renewable energy infrastructure. The United States and Indonesia intend to pursue an ambitious program of cooperation on wind, solar, civil nuclear, and geothermal energy, while enhancing cooperation on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the minerals, waste, and transportation sectors. The two countries also acknowledge the value of the Net Zero World Initiative to support the transformation of Indonesia's energy economy, including cooperation on low-carbon battery supply chains.
In support of the goals of JETP, the United States and Indonesia also announce a memorandum of understanding on sustainable energy and mineral development that will advance technical cooperation on enabling environments and regulatory frameworks to help increase the uptake of renewable energy resources, enhance grid resiliency and security, and improve technologies for responsible mining and minerals processing practices. As the clean energy transition will have enormous impacts for the workers and communities throughout Indonesia, the United States will also engage with Indonesian policymakers in addressing workforce needs such as strategic investments, workforce training, and equitable just transition policies to ensure workers benefit from the evolving clean energy industry. President Biden welcomes Indonesia to the Greening Government Initiative (GGI), as a platform for cooperation on these issues.
The two countries applaud bilateral public-private cooperation to conduct feasibility studies to deploy small modular reactor (SMR) technology for the clean energy transition. This effort is encompassed under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment with new funding through the Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of SMR Technology (FIRST) program.
The leaders' strong commitment to addressing the drivers and impacts of climate change is reflected through joint efforts such as the U.S.-Indonesia Bilateral Climate Working Group on forests, nature, and climate; the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry-U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Cooperation; and IPEF. The United States and Indonesia will also initiate a dialogue on scaling climate finance and investment in the forest and land use sectors to support emissions reductions and the sustainable bioeconomy.
Deepening People-to-People Ties, Cultural Exchanges, and Tourism 
The leaders underscore their plan to foster stronger people-to-people connections and cultural exchanges while deepening cooperation in education, research and development. Both sides look to achieve this goal through returning the number of Peace Corps volunteers in Indonesia to pre-pandemic levels, engaging in sustained interfaith dialogues via the Indonesia-United States Council on Religion and Pluralism, and increasing the number of Fulbright awardees between Indonesia and the United States. Additionally, the leaders commit to grow educational, professional, and cultural exchanges, including through the Beasiswa Seni Budaya Indonesia, Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan, Indonesian International Student Mobility Awards (IISMA), Darmasiswa Scholarship, the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI), and the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study program (KL-YES). The leaders jointly announce the U.S.-Indonesia Tourism Partnership that strengthens travel and tourism opportunities between the two countries. President Biden applauds President Widodo's support for the establishment of a Georgetown University presence in Jakarta, which will help Indonesia build its human capital and research capacity, while training the next generation of American policy specialists on Indonesia and Southeast Asia.
The leaders welcome further cooperation to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and entrepreneurship collaboration, with a special focus on women and youth. The leaders applaud their countries' growing engagement on cultural heritage preservation and conservation, including through a memorandum of understanding between the United States' Smithsonian National Museum of Asian Art and Indonesia's Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. The leaders note the plans for a YSEALI initiative on sustainable and inclusive tourism development, U.S. support for preserving Indonesian local languages, collaboration to document over 400 local recipes across the archipelago, and plans for a discussion series on best practices in historic preservation and museum management. As part of this collaboration, President Widodo also recognizes U.S. efforts to support the restoration and modernization of Indonesia's historic National Museum, and other museums and cultural heritage sites.
Fostering Peace and Stability in the Indo-Pacific and Beyond
President Biden congratulates President Widodo on Indonesia's successful ASEAN chair year and expresses support for Indonesia's leadership in the Indo-Pacific. President Widodo welcomes the U.S. commitment to ASEAN, as reflected in the November 2022 upgrade of the U.S.-ASEAN relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and the 2022 ASEAN-U.S. Special Summit in Washington, D.C. The leaders welcome Lao PDR's assumption of the ASEAN chair in 2024.
President Biden expresses support for ASEAN's efforts to resolve the crisis in Myanmar. The leaders continue to call on the regime to end the horrific violence, allow unhindered humanitarian access, release all those unjustly detained, and re-establish Myanmar's path to inclusive democracy. They reaffirm their continued support for the people of Myanmar, including those who have been displaced, and for ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus.
President Widodo welcomes U.S. support for ASEAN centrality and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and acknowledges the value of regional and sub-regional mechanisms in the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions working with ASEAN on specific areas of common interests. President Widodo also welcomes the U.S. role as the host of this year's APEC forum, and the leaders look forward to the successful conclusion of the United States' APEC 2023 host year.
Both leaders underscore their unwavering support for freedom of navigation in and overflight above the South China Sea and respect for sovereignty and for sovereign rights and jurisdiction of coastal states over their exclusive economic zones and continental shelves in accordance with the international law of the sea, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The United States and Indonesia also recognize the importance of the full and effective implementation of the 2002 Declaration of the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea in its entirety and reaffirmed their support for ASEAN efforts to conclude an effective and substantive Code of Conduct in the South China Sea that is in accordance with international law, particularly the 1982 UNCLOS, and respects the rights and interests of third parties. The leaders note the ruling of the 2016 arbitral tribunal, constituted pursuant to UNCLOS. President Biden and President Widodo welcome the signing of a bilateral Work Plan on Maritime Security Cooperation, which will enhance Indonesia's maritime security and safety capabilities, and to prevent and counter illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing, including those associated with transnational organized criminal groups and labor abuses.
The two leaders exchanged views on the ongoing crisis in Gaza. Each president stated his national position. President Widodo also shared the united messages of the Joint Arab-Islamic Summit in Riyadh on 11 November 2023. The leaders agree that they should work together and with other regional partners for a durable peace through a two-state solution.
The leaders discussed the war against Ukraine and call on the Russian Federation to completely withdraw from the territory of Ukraine, underscoring the need to reach a just and lasting peace based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, including the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence of Ukraine.

Joint Statement by President Biden and President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo of Indonesia"
"Nov 14, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-efforts-address-climate-change-and-exchange-with-reporters,Remarks on Efforts To Address Climate Change and an Exchange With Reporters,"""The President. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
Well, I told Ritika: When she's President, don't forget me. [Laughter]
Ritika, thank you for that introduction and your beautiful artwork. You all see the artwork? Can you see it up here? It's on the right side; I don't know whether you can see it.
And thank you to all of you—from the climate scientists and experts who are here today and all across the country who have contributed to this critical endeavor.
I'm—particularly want to thank Allison Crimmins—you know, who put together the team to write this report and—we're releasing today. It was an easy thing to do. Not much to it. [Laughter] Only about 700 people you had to get in line. [Laughter]
Well, more than 30 years ago, Congress passed a law that called for a detailed scientific report on the impacts of global changes in the environment. Since then, these assessments delivered to the Congress and the President have been the go-to resource in America for information on climate change and for developing climate solutions.
Today I'm proud to announce that my administration just released the Fifth Climate Assessment in our Nation's history. It didn't just come from—out of thin air. Written over 4 years, 750 authors and experts, thousands—thousands—of American contributors from every single State in the Nation as well as several Territories and Tribes.
It's the most comprehensive assessment on state climate change [the state of climate change; White House correction] in the history of America. And it matters. This assessment shows us in clear scientific terms that climate change is impacting all regions, all sectors of the United States; not just some, all. It shows that communities across America are taking more action than ever to reduce climate risks. It warns that more action is still badly needed.
We can't be complacent. Let me say that again: We can't be complacent. We have to keep going. Above all, it shows us that climate action offers an opportunity for the Nation to come together and do some really big things.
You know, I've seen firsthand what the report's made clear: the devastating toll of climate change and its existential threat to all of us. And it is the ultimate threat to humanity: climate change.
I've walked the streets of Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Florida, Puerto Rico, where historic hurricanes and floods wiped out homes, hospitals, houses of worship—just wiped them right off the map.
I've met with families in Texas, Kentucky, Mississippi, where catastrophic winter storms and tornadoes devoured everything in their path: schools, businesses, police stations, a fire house.
I've seen firefighters in Idaho, Maui, and New Mexico, California, Colorado, where wildfires destroyed whole neighborhoods and sacred Tribal sites, spreading smoky haze thousands of miles and forcing millions of Americans to shelter indoors—and unsafe air to breathe.
Look—and by the way—and I've flown over them, all these areas in helicopters. They tell me that more of our forest land has—forest has burned to the ground than make up the entire State of New Jersey. The entire State. Some say Maryland, New Jersey, but the—[inaudible]—is, it's—that's just gigantic and has incredible impacts.
Record temperatures in Texas, Arizona, and elsewhere are affecting lives and livelihoods of more than 100 million Americans. And this summer and this fall have been the Earth's hottest since the global records began to be kept in the 1800s. Think about that: the hottest we've ever recorded in history. It's an impact—an impact that decades are making because inaction, for this—there was inaction for much too long.
Look—but we're acting now, and we have been acting. We've come to the point where it's foolish for anyone to deny the impacts of climate change anymore.
But it's simply a simple fact that there are a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle—MAGA Republican leaders—who still deny climate change, still deny that it's a problem.
My predecessors—much of the MAGA Republican Party, in fact, are—feel very strongly about that. Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future. The impacts we're seeing are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious, and more costly.
Last year alone, natural disasters in America caused $178 billion—$178 billion—in damages. They hit everyone, no matter where—what their circumstances, but they hit the most vulnerable the hardest: seniors; people with disabilities; people experiencing homelessness who have nowhere to turn; Black, Brown, and Tribal communities; Territories that are most exposed and—have the least resource—fewest resources.
But, folks, none of this is inevitable. None of it's inevitable.
From day one, my administration has taken unprecedented climate action. We're working with everyone from mayors to county officials to entrepreneurs to academics; business leaders, labor leaders, Tribal leaders. We're focused in all parts of America: cities, suburbs, small towns, and rural communities, and Tribal Nations.
And here's how. We're using a law I got passed when I first came to office called the American Rescue Plan to help States and cities become more resilient to climate change, promoting energy efficiency by weatherizing homes, reducing flooding by building infrastructure to handle storm surges, opening cooling centers impacted—and centers where there's particular great heat impact and people need a shelter.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the bipartisan infrastructure law, which I signed 2 years ago and the most significant investment in our Nation's infrastructure in American history: roads, bridges, ports, airports, high-speed internet. It delivers clean water to your community, lowers your energy bills, upgrades your electric grid so you don't have to power them—so you don't have to lose power, I should say, when storms and heat waves hit.
The CHIPS and Science Act I signed last year——
[At this point, the President coughed.]
Excuse me—I signed last year—excuse me——
[The President coughed.]
——I signed last year positions us to lead the—in semiconductor manufacturing and innovation, which is critical to clean energy development and deployment.
Semiconductors are those small, little computer chips you all know, the size of the tip of your little finger, that power everything in our lives, from smartphones to appliances. We invented those chips. We invented them. And we're—other countries started making them, and we weren't. Not anymore. We're making these chips here in America.
And my Inflation Reduction Act is the most significant climate investment ever anywhere in the world. Among many things it does, it offers tax credits to make your home more energy efficient; upgrading windows and doors to keep drafts out and heat in; tax credits to installing electric heat pumps and solar panels on your roof, saving hundreds of dollars in your family bills; tax credits to buy electric vehicles as we build the electric vehicle future here in America.
We're transforming clean energy development that's threatening [creating; White House correction] good-paying jobs, including union jobs, in all of America.
We're already attracted over half a—we've attracted a half a trillion dollars—a half a trillion dollars—in private-sector investment for my ""Investing in America"" agenda in clean energy and advanced manufacturing. We're just getting—and we're just getting started. I mean, we really are: We're just getting started.
All told, my ""Investing in America"" agenda and those bold climate laws are the most ambitious in American history.
Today's release, the Fifth National Climate Assessment, is a critical part of that effort. It lays out the threats and dangers, but most experts would acknowledge it also shows solutions are within reach. Solutions are within reach.
It takes time for the investments we're making to be fully materialized. But we just have to keep at it. We need to do more and move faster, and we have the tools to do it.
And, for the first time ever, we're also releasing the report with new on—with a new online tool, that I just was shown a moment ago in the other room, so everyone can explore exactly what's happening in their State, their city, and their county by going online to whitehouse.gov/nca—whitehouse.gov/nca.
That's a—very different from the previous administration that tried to bury this report. They didn't even want to make sure this report even came to light. We're shining it on—we're—and we're sharing this report in detail with the American people so they know exactly what they're facing and what we're going to have to do.
But that's not all. Along with this assessment, I'm announcing $6 billion in new investments from the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law to make communities across the country more resilient to climate change. This funding will be administered by the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Interior, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
And it's going to be focused on key climate goals, including modernizing our aging electric grid to withstand extreme weather, which is causing fire—the—these forest fires. When those towers come down and the lines snap, they catch fire. The forests catch fire. It costs a lot more money to bury those underground and do other things, but we have to do it. And it's causing significant outages as well.
Reducing flood risks to communities. Improving drought resilience. Supporting conservation for our national parks. I've already been able to conserve 21 million acres of our most precious and sacred lands and waters just thus far, just in the first 2½ years. And advancing environmental justice for disadvantaged communities, because they're the ones always left behind.
Let me close with this. Last week, I stopped by the ""White House Demo Day"" to meet with the scientists and experts overseeing groundbreaking and cutting-edge science and technology that my administration is funding right now, right here in America. It was truly inspirational hearing from experts all across the Government, the private sector, and academia touching on so many fields.
I saw a prosthetic arm that can sense touch, and it's controlled by one's thoughts. A prosthetic arm. It's just like your hand. You think you want to move your finger—well, it worked out you think—he wants to move his hand, he can do it. It's an incredible breakthrough.
Electric heat pumps to help old homes transition to clean energy homes of the future. Robots for ocean exploration that survey marine life along unmapped seafloors where barely any light penetrates. And so much more.
It was a reminder, at least for me, of what I've long believed—that America can be defined by a single word. I mean this sincerely. The single that—I was asked by Xi Jinping years ago, when we were in the Tibetan Plateau, could I define America. I said, ""Yes, one word: possibilities."" Possibilities.
In this administration, America will be the place where great science changes what's possible. That's why I've never been more optimistic about America's future.
We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we work together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Q. What are the possibilities in San Francisco, Mr. President?
China-U.S. Relations 
Q. Sir—[inaudible]—with your meeting with Xi tomorrow, sir? And do you—what—how would you define success with your meeting with President Xi?
The President. To get back on a normal course of corresponding: being able to pick up the phone and talk to one another if there's a crisis, being able to make sure our militaries still have contact with one another.
We can't take—as I told you, we're not trying to decouple from China, but we're—what we're trying to do is change the relationship for the better. From my perspective, if in fact the Chinese people, who are in trouble right now economically—if the average homeowner or—the ""homeowner""—if the average citizen in China was able to have a decent-paying job, that benefits them and it benefits all of us. But I'm not going to continue to sustain the support for positions where if you want to invest in China, we have to turn over all our trade secrets.
Thank you.
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once. The President then addressed participants onstage as follows.]
The President. Ready?
Q. Mr. President, what are the possibilities—[inaudible]?
Hostages Held by Hamas in Gaza, Palestinian Territories 
Q. Mr. President, can you address the hostages directly and give them a message of hope and resilience in these troubling times?
The President. Yes, I can. I've been talking with the—people involved every single day. I believe it's going to happen, but I don't want to get into any detail.
Q. What's your message for the families?
The President. Hang in there. We're coming.
Q. Will you sign the CR?
Hostages Held by Hamas in Gaza 
Q. Mr. President, there is a report out this morning that Israel and Hamas are close to a deal for the release of 70 of the hostages. Is there anything you can add to that?
The President. No.
Thank you.

"Nov 15, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-woodside-california,"The President's News Conference in Woodside, California","""The President. I didn't know there were this many people in town. Please have a seat. As you know, I just concluded several hours of meetings with President Xi, and I believe they were some of the most constructive and productive discussions we've had.
I've been meeting with President Xi since both of us were Vice President over 10 years ago. Our meetings have always been candid and straightforward. We haven't always agreed, but they've been straightforward. And today, built on the groundwork we laid over the past several months of high-level diplomacy between our teams, we've made some important progress, I believe.
First, I'm pleased to announce that after many years of being on hold, we are restarting cooperation between the United States and the P.R.C. on counternarcotics.
In 2019, you may remember, China took action to greatly reduce the amount of fentanyl shipped directly from China to the United States. But in the years since that time, the challenge has evolved from finished fentanyl to fentanyl chemical ingredients and pill presses, which are being shipped without controls. And by the way, some of these pills are being inserted in other drugs, like cocaine, and a lot of people are dying.
More people in the United States between the ages of 18 to 49 die from fentanyl than from guns, car accidents, or any other cause. Period.
So today, with this new understanding, we're taking action to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals and pill presses from China to the Western Hemisphere. It's going to save lives, and I appreciate President Xi's commitment on this issue. President Xi and I tasked our teams to maintain a policy and law enforcement coordination going forward to make sure it works.
I also want to thank the bipartisan congressional delegation to China, led by Leader Schumer, in October for supporting efforts—this effort so strongly.
Secondly, and this is critically important, we're reassuming military-to-military contacts—direct contacts. As a lot of you press know who follow this, that's been cut off, and it's been worrisome. That's how accidents happen: misunderstandings. So we're back to direct, open, clear, direct communications on a direct basis.
Vital miscalculations on either side can—are—can cause real, real trouble with a country like China or any other major country. And so I think we made real progress there as well.
And thirdly, we're going to get our experts together to discuss risk and safety issues associated with artificial intelligence. As many of you who travel with me around the world almost everywhere I go—every major leader wants to talk about the impact of artificial intelligence.
These are tangible steps in the right direction to determine what's useful and what's not useful, what's dangerous and what's acceptable.
Moreover, there are evidence of cases that I've made all along: The United States will continue to compete vigorously with the P.R.C. But we'll manage that competition responsibly so it doesn't veer into conflict or accidental conflict. And where it's possible, where our interests are—coincide, we're going to work together, like we did on fentanyl.
That's what the world expects of us—the rest of the world expects, not just in—people in China and the United States, but the rest of the world expects that of us. And that's what the United States is going to be doing.
Today President Xi and I also exchanged views on a range of regional and global issues, including Russia's refusal and brutal war—to stop the war—and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza.
And as I always do, I raised areas where the United States has concerns about the P.R.C.'s actions, including detained and exit-banned U.S. citizens, human rights, and corrective—coercive activities in the South China Sea. We discussed all three of those things. I gave them names of individuals that we think are being held, and hopefully, we can get them released as well. No agreement on that. No agreement on that.
I also stressed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.
It's clear that we object to Beijing's nonmarket economic practices and disadvantaged—that disadvantage American businesses and workers and that we'll continue to address them. And I named what I thought a number of those were.
I welcome the positive steps we've taken today, and it's important for the world to see that we're implementing the approach in the best traditions of American diplomacy. We're talking to our competitors. And the key—and just talking, just being blunt with one another so there's no misunderstanding is a key element to maintaining global stability and delivering for the American people.
And, in the months ahead, we're going to continue to preserve and pursue high-level diplomacy with the P.R.C. in both directions to keep the lines of communication open, including between President Xi and me. He and I agreed that either one of us could pick up the phone, call directly, and we'd be heard immediately.
And that's—now I'd like to be able to take some questions, if I may. And I'm told that Demetri [Demetri Sevastopulo] of the Financial Times has the first question.
Q. Thank you. And, as an Irishman, I apologize for bringing the rain.
The President. Well, holy God, I wouldn't have called on you if I had known that. [Laughter] No, I'm teasing. Go ahead. Fire away, Demetri.
China-U.S. Relations/Taiwan 
Q. President Biden, given that America is playing a key role in two major global crises—Ukraine and in Gaza—does that alter your previous commitment to defend Taiwan from any Chinese military action? And did Xi Jinping outline the conditions under which China would attack Taiwan?
The President. Look, I reiterate what I've said since I've become President and what every previous President of late has said: that we maintain an agreement that there is a ""one China"" policy and that—and I'm not going to change that. That's not going to change.
And so that's about the extent to which we discussed it.
Next question, sorry, was Bloomberg.
President Xi Jinping of China/Efforts To Combat Synthetic Opioids 
Q. Good evening, Mr. President.
It appears, among other issues, that your agreement with President Xi over fentanyl would require—will require a lot of trust and verification to ensure success in curbing those drug flows. I'm wondering: After today and considering all that you've been through in the past year, would you say, Mr. President, that you trust President Xi?
And secondly, if I could, on Taiwan. You've—you and your administration officials have warned President Xi and China about interference in the upcoming election. I'm wondering what would the consequences be if they do, in fact, interfere in the election. Thank you.
The President. Well, I made—had that discussion with him too, made it clear: I didn't expect any interference, any at all. And we had that discussion as he was leaving.
Look, do I trust? You know, I—""trust but verify,"" as that old saying goes. That's where I am.
And you know, we're in a competitive relationship, China and the United States. But my responsibility is to make it—make this rational and manageable so it doesn't result in conflict.
That's what I'm all about, and that's what this is about: to find a place where we can come together and where we find mutual interests that—but most importantly, from my perspective, that are in the interests of the American people. That's what this is about, and that's exactly what we'll do.
You know, we're in a situation where we agreed that fentanyl and its precursors will be curbed substantially and the pill presses. That's a big movement. They're doing—and by the way, you know, I won't—I guess I shouldn't identify where it occurred. But, John, I know two people near where I live. Their kids, literally, as I said—strange as—they woke up dead. Someone had inserted in—whether the young man did or not—inserted, in a drug he was taking, fentanyl.
Again, I don't—I hope you don't have any experience with knowing anyone, but this is the largest killer of people in that age category.
And you know, I guess the other thing I think is most important is that since I—I've spent more time with President Xi than any world leader has, just because we were Vice Presidents. His President was President Hu; I'm not making a joke. President Hu and—and President Obama thought we should get to know one another. It wasn't appropriate for the President of United States to be walking—dealing with the Vice President.
So we met—if I'm not mistaken, I think it was 68 hours of just face to face—just us and a simultaneous interpreter. So I think I know the man. I know his modus operandi. He's been—we have disagreements. He has a different view than I have on a lot of things. But he's been straight. I don't mean that he's good, bad, or indifferent. He's just been straight.
And so, you know, we—as I said, the thing that I find most assuring is, he raised and I fully agreed that, either one of us have any concern, Mr. Ambassador—any concern about anything between our nations or happening in our region, we should pick up the phone and call one another, and we'll take the call. That's an important progress.
I'm embarrassed—I think it's CBS, but I can't remember who with CBS. I'm sorry.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Weijia Jiang with CBS.
The President. Sorry. [Laughter] I apologize.
China-U.S. Relations/Quadrilateral Security Dialogue 
Q. You continue to stress the need to ensure competition with China does not veer into conflict or confrontation. In the past 2 years, there have been more than 180 incidents of Chinese aggression against U.S aircraft in the Indo-Pacific and, of course, the ramped up military activity in the South China Sea. If that does not count as veering into confrontation, then what does? And did you issue any warnings to Xi against continuing that behavior?
The President. Well, first of all, none of it did end up in a conflict, number one.
Number two, you may recall: I did a few little things like get the Quad together, allow Australia to have access to new submarines, moving in the direction of working with the Philippines. So our actions speak louder than our words. He fully understands.
Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, Palestinian Territories/Hamas/Israeli Military Operations 
Q. And because of the news of the day, sir, I do have a question about the IDF raid on the Al-Shifa Hospital, as it tries to contain and take out the Hamas operative that is there. This week, you also said that we must protect hospitals. So, when you weigh the target against the number of civilians inside the hospital, is the operation underway justified?
The President. Well, look, we did discuss this, by the way. But we can't let it get out of control.
Here's the situation: You have a circumstance where the first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters, their military hidden under a hospital. And that's a fact. That's what's happened.
Israel did not go in with a large number of troops, did not raid, did not rush everything down. They've gone in, and they've gone in with their soldiers carrying weapons or guns. They were told—told—let me be precise. We've discussed the need for them to be incredibly careful. You have a circumstance where you know there is a fair number of Hamas terrorists. Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again like they did before, do everything from cutting babies' heads off to burning women and children alive.
And so the idea that they're going to just stop and not do anything is not realistic. This is not the carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They're going through these tunnels; they're going in the hospital.
And if you notice, I was mildly preoccupied today. I apologize, I didn't see everything. But what I did see, whether—I haven't had it confirmed yet—I have asked my team to answer the question. But what happened is, they're also bringing in incubators. They're bringing in other—other means to help the people in the hospital, and they've given the doctors and—I'm told—the doctors and nurses and personnel an opportunity to get out of harm's way.
So this is a different story than I believe was occurring before, an indiscriminate bombing.
What do you got? Washington Post. I think that's right.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Oh, there you are. Sorry. I couldn't see you in the light.
Gaza Conflict/Israeli Military Operations/International Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. That's okay. Mr. President, Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians in just over a month and created——
The President. I'm sorry, you're breaking up. I didn't—would you——
Q. Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians in just over a month and created a humanitarian disaster. Israeli officials have said this war could take months or even years. Have you communicated to Prime Minister Netanyahu any sort of deadline or timeframe for how long you are willing to support Israel in this operation? Are you comfortable with the operation going on indefinitely? And is there any deal underway to free hostages? Thank you.
The President. Yes, no—working backwards forward. Look, I have been deeply involved in moving on the hostage negotiation, and I don't want to get ahead of myself here because I don't know what's happened in the last 4 hours.
But they're—I have—we've gotten great cooperation from the Qataris. I've spoken with them as well a number of times. I think the pause and that Israeli—that the Israelis have agreed to is down to—I'm getting into too much detail. I know, Mr. Secretary. I'm going to stop.
The—but I am mildly hopeful. I'm mildly hopeful.
With regard to when is this going to stop, I think it's going to stop when the—when Hamas no longer maintains the capacity to murder and abuse and just do horrific things to the Israelis. And they are in—and they still think they—at least as of this morning, they still thought they could.
I guess the best way for me to say it is that I take a look. The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, acknowledges they have an obligation to use as much caution as they can in going after their targets. It's not like they're rushing in the hospital, knocking down doors, and you know, pulling people aside and shooting people indiscriminately.
But Hamas, as I said, said they plan on attacking the Israelis again. And this is a terrible dilemma. So what do you do?
I think that Israel is also taking risks themselves about their folks being killed in one-to-one—going through these hospital rooms, hospital halls. But one thing has been established is that Hamas does have headquarters, weapons, materiel below this hospital and, I suspect, others. But how long it's going to last, I don't know.
Look, I made it clear to the Israelis that—and to Bibi and to his war cabinet that I think the only ultimate answer here is a two-state solution that's real. We've got to get to the point where there is an ability to be able to even talk without worrying about whether or not we're just dealing with—they're dealing with Hamas—that's going to engage in the same activities they did over the past—on the 7th.
So it's—but I can't tell—I'm not a fortuneteller. I can't tell you how long it's going to last. But I can tell you I don't think it ultimately ends until there's a two-state solution. I made it clear to the Israelis I think it's a big mistake to—for them to think they're going to occupy Gaza and maintain Gaza. I don't think that works.
And so we're going to—I think you're going to see efforts to bring along—well, I shouldn't go into it anymore, because that's things I've been negotiating with Arab countries and others about what the next steps are.
But anyway, thank you all very much. Appreciate it very much.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Thank you. This ends the press conference.

Q. Do you still think of President Xi as a dictator, Mr. President?
Hamas Attacks Against Israel/Hostages Held by Hamas in Gaza 
Q. Sir, on the hostages, you said, ""We're coming for you."" What did you mean when you said, ""We're coming for you""?
The President. When Hamas—well, Hamas said they plan on doing the same thing again—what they did—what they did on the 7th. They're going to go in—they want to slaughter Israelis. They want to do it again. And they've said it out loud. They're not kidding about it. They're not backing off.
And so I just asked the rhetorical question, ""I wonder what we would do if that were the case?""
Q. On the hostages, though, you said, ""We're coming for you."" What did you mean to the American hostages when you said——
The President. Oh——
Q. ——""Hang tight. We're coming for you.""
The President. What I meant was, I'm doing everything in my power to get you out—coming to help you to get you out. I don't mean sending military in to get them. Is that what you thought I might mean?
Q. I defer to you.
The President. No, no, no it's—it—I was not talking about a military. I was talking about we—you're on our mind every single day. Five to six times a day, I'm working on how I can be helpful in getting the hostages released and have a period of time where there's a pause long enough to let that happen.
And there is somewhere between 50 and 100 hostages there, we think.
Q. And, sir, one is a 3-year-old American child.
The President. You're darn right it is. That's why I'm not going to stop till we get her.
Thank you. Thank you.
[Several reporters asked questions at once.]
The President. Who can holler the loudest?
Gaza Conflict/Al-Shifa Hospital 
Q. Can you just detail for us what kind of evidence the U.S. has seen that Hamas has a command center under Al-Shifa Hospital?
The President. No, I can't tell you. I won't tell you.
Q. Do you feel absolutely confident based on what you know——
The President. Yes.
Q. ——that that is the truth?
The President. Yes.
President Xi Jinping of China 
Q. And, Mr. President, after today, would you still refer to President Xi as a ""dictator""? This is a term that you used earlier this year.
The President. Well, look, he is. I mean, he's a dictator in the sense that he is a guy who runs a country that—it's a communist country that is based on a form of government totally different than ours.
Anyway, we made progress.

[President Joe Biden, 11/18/23]
Today, the world faces an inflection point, where the choices we make — including in the crises in Europe and the Middle East — will determine the direction of our future for generations to come.
What will our world look like on the other side of these conflicts?
Will we deny Hamas the ability to carry out pure, unadulterated evil? Will Israelis and Palestinians one day live side by side in peace, with two states for two peoples?
Will we hold Vladimir Putin accountable for his aggression, so the people of Ukraine can live free and Europe remains an anchor for global peace and security?
And the overarching question: Will we relentlessly pursue our positive vision for the future, or will we allow those who do not share our values to drag the world to a more dangerous and divided place?
Both Putin and Hamas are fighting to wipe a neighboring democracy off the map. And both Putin and Hamas hope to collapse broader regional stability and integration and take advantage of the ensuing disorder. America cannot, and will not, let that happen. For our own national security interests — and for the good of the entire world.
The United States is the essential nation. We rally allies and partners to stand up to aggressors and make progress toward a brighter, more peaceful future. The world looks to us to solve the problems of our time. That is the duty of leadership, and America will lead. For if we walk away from the challenges of today, the risk of conflict could spread, and the costs to address them will only rise. We will not let that happen.
That conviction is at the root of my approach to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue to defend their freedom against Putin's brutal war.
We know from two world wars in the past century that when aggression in Europe goes unanswered, the crisis does not burn itself out. It draws America in directly. That's why our commitment to Ukraine today is an investment in our own security. It prevents a broader conflict tomorrow.
We are keeping American troops out of this war by supporting the brave Ukrainians defending their freedom and homeland. We are providing them with weapons and economic assistance to stop Putin's drive for conquest, before the conflict spreads farther.
The United States is not doing this alone. More than 50 nations have joined us to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself. Our partners are shouldering much of the economic responsibility for supporting Ukraine. We have also built a stronger and more united NATO, which enhances our security through the strength of our allies, while making clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory to deter further Russian aggression. Our allies in Asia are standing with us as well to support Ukraine and hold Putin accountable, because they understand that stability in Europe and in the Indo-Pacific are inherently connected.
We have also seen throughout history how conflicts in the Middle East can unleash consequences around the globe.
We stand firmly with the Israeli people as they defend themselves against the murderous nihilism of Hamas. On Oct. 7, Hamas slaughtered 1,200 people, including 35 American citizens, in the worst atrocity committed against the Jewish people in a single day since the Holocaust. Infants and toddlers, mothers and fathers, grandparents, people with disabilities, even Holocaust survivors were maimed and murdered. Entire families were massacred in their homes. Young people were gunned down at a music festival. Bodies riddled with bullets and burned beyond recognition. And for over a month, the families of more than 200 hostages taken by Hamas, including babies and Americans, have been living in hell, anxiously waiting to discover whether their loved ones are alive or dead. At the time of this writing, my team and I are working hour by hour, doing everything we can to get the hostages released.
And while Israelis are still in shock and suffering the trauma of this attack, Hamas has promised that it will relentlessly try to repeat Oct. 7. It has said very clearly that it will not stop.
The Palestinian people deserve a state of their own and a future free from Hamas. I, too, am heartbroken by the images out of Gaza and the deaths of many thousands of civilians, including children. Palestinian children are crying for lost parents. Parents are writing their child's name on their hand or leg so they can be identified if the worst happens. Palestinian nurses and doctors are trying desperately to save every precious life they possibly can, with little to no resources. Every innocent Palestinian life lost is a tragedy that rips apart families and communities.
Our goal should not be simply to stop the war for today — it should be to end the war forever, break the cycle of unceasing violence, and build something stronger in Gaza and across the Middle East so that history does not keep repeating itself.
Just weeks before Oct. 7, I met in New York with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The main subject of that conversation was a set of substantial commitments that would help both Israel and the Palestinian territories better integrate into the broader Middle East. That is also the idea behind the innovative economic corridor that will connect India to Europe through the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel, which I announced together with partners at the Group of 20 summit in India in early September. Stronger integration between countries creates predictable markets and draws greater investment. Better regional connection — including physical and economic infrastructure — supports higher employment and more opportunities for young people. That's what we have been working to realize in the Middle East. It is a future that has no place for Hamas's violence and hate, and I believe that attempting to destroy the hope for that future is one reason that Hamas instigated this crisis.
This much is clear: A two-state solution is the only way to ensure the long-term security of both the Israeli and Palestinian people. Though right now it may seem like that future has never been further away, this crisis has made it more imperative than ever.
A two-state solution — two peoples living side by side with equal measures of freedom, opportunity and dignity — is where the road to peace must lead. Reaching it will take commitments from Israelis and Palestinians, as well as from the United States and our allies and partners. That work must start now.
To that end, the United States has proposed basic principles for how to move forward from this crisis, to give the world a foundation on which to build.
To start, Gaza must never again be used as a platform for terrorism. There must be no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, no reoccupation, no siege or blockade, and no reduction in territory. And after this war is over, the voices of Palestinian people and their aspirations must be at the center of post-crisis governance in Gaza.
As we strive for peace, Gaza and the West Bank should be reunited under a single governance structure, ultimately under a revitalized Palestinian Authority, as we all work toward a two-state solution. I have been emphatic with Israel's leaders that extremist violence against Palestinians in the West Bank must stop and that those committing the violence must be held accountable. The United States is prepared to take our own steps, including issuing visa bans against extremists attacking civilians in the West Bank.
The international community must commit resources to support the people of Gaza in the immediate aftermath of this crisis, including interim security measures, and establish a reconstruction mechanism to sustainably meet Gaza's long-term needs. And it is imperative that no terrorist threats ever again emanate from Gaza or the West Bank.
If we can agree on these first steps, and take them together, we can begin to imagine a different future. In the months ahead, the United States will redouble our efforts to establish a more peaceful, integrated and prosperous Middle East — a region where a day like Oct. 7 is unthinkable.
In the meantime, we will continue working to prevent this conflict from spreading and escalating further. I ordered two U.S. carrier groups to the region to enhance deterrence. We are going after Hamas and those who finance and facilitate its terrorism, levying multiple rounds of sanctions to degrade Hamas's financial structure, cutting it off from outside funding and blocking access to new funding channels, including via social media. I have also been clear that the United States will do what is necessary to defend U.S. troops and personnel stationed across the Middle East — and we have responded multiple times to the strikes against us.
I also immediately traveled to Israel — the first American president to do so during wartime — to show solidarity with the Israeli people and reaffirm to the world that the United States has Israel's back. Israel must defend itself. That is its right. And while in Tel Aviv, I also counseled Israelis against letting their hurt and rage mislead them into making mistakes we ourselves have made in the past.
From the very beginning, my administration has called for respecting international humanitarian law, minimizing the loss of innocent lives and prioritizing the protection of civilians. Following Hamas's attack on Israel, aid to Gaza was cut off, and food, water and medicine reserves dwindled rapidly. As part of my travel to Israel, I worked closely with the leaders of Israel and Egypt to reach an agreement to restart the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to Gazans. Within days, trucks with supplies again began to cross the border. Today, nearly 100 aid trucks enter Gaza from Egypt each day, and we continue working to increase the flow of assistance manyfold. I've also advocated for humanitarian pauses in the conflict to permit civilians to depart areas of active fighting and to help ensure that aid reaches those in need. Israel took the additional step to create two humanitarian corridors and implement daily four-hour pauses in the fighting in northern Gaza to allow Palestinian civilians to flee to safer areas in the south.
This stands in stark opposition to Hamas's terrorist strategy: hide among Palestinian civilians. Use children and innocents as human shields. Position terrorist tunnels beneath hospitals, schools, mosques and residential buildings. Maximize the death and suffering of innocent people — Israeli and Palestinian. If Hamas cared at all for Palestinian lives, it would release all the hostages, give up arms, and surrender the leaders and those responsible for Oct. 7.
As long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction, a cease-fire is not peace. To Hamas's members, every cease-fire is time they exploit to rebuild their stockpile of rockets, reposition fighters and restart the killing by attacking innocents again. An outcome that leaves Hamas in control of Gaza would once more perpetuate its hate and deny Palestinian civilians the chance to build something better for themselves.
And here at home, in moments when fear and suspicion, anger and rage run hard, we have to work even harder to hold on to the values that make us who we are. We're a nation of religious freedom and freedom of expression. We all have a right to debate and disagree and peacefully protest, but without fear of being targeted at schools or workplaces or elsewhere in our communities.
In recent years, too much hate has been given too much oxygen, fueling racism and an alarming rise in antisemitism in America. That has intensified in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks. Jewish families worry about being targeted in school, while wearing symbols of their faith on the street or otherwise going about their daily lives. At the same time, too many Muslim Americans, Arab Americans and Palestinian Americans, and so many other communities, are outraged and hurting, fearing the resurgence of the Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11.
We can't stand by when hate rears its head. We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of hate and bias. We must renounce violence and vitriol and see each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans.
In a moment of so much violence and suffering — in Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and so many other places — it can be difficult to imagine that something different is possible. But we must never forget the lesson learned time and again throughout our history: Out of great tragedy and upheaval, enormous progress can come. More hope. More freedom. Less rage. Less grievance. Less war. We must not lose our resolve to pursue those goals, because now is when clear vision, big ideas and political courage are needed most. That is the strategy that my administration will continue to lead — in the Middle East, Europe and around the globe.

Before I begin, I'm going to ask for a vote: Do I free the turkeys today?

Audience members. Yes!

The President. Anyway, good to see you all. If you have a seat, please take it.

It's great to see you all. It's a—good morning. I'm honored to welcome—welcome to the biggest edition of this wonderful White House Thanksgiving tradition. And it really it.

We've got a lot of special guests here today: children and families from my staff and Cabinet. Where are y'all? Holler. There you go. All right.

Students from Washington Eliot-Hine Middle School.

Audience members. Happy birthday!

Audience member. Happy birthday!

The President. Well, thank you very much.

Jill and I met them during the back-to-school visit. I'm glad you remembered us. Thank you.

Audience member. [Inaudible]

The President. [Laughter] I remember.

And Future Farmers of America, leaders of 4-H Councils, and leaders across the agriculture community.

I just want you to know, everyone here, we're excited to have our honored guests with us today: Liberty and Bell. This is their day.

Thanks to the chairman of the National Turkey Federation Steve Lykken—Steve and your entire family—I met—got to meet the entire family. And by the way, I—it's my birthday today, and they can—actually sang ""Birthday"" to me.

I just want you to know, it's difficult turning 60. [Laughter] Difficult. [Laughter]

His entire family raised these birds on their family farm in Minnesota. And, Steve, you are—you're grateful to—we're grateful to your entire family. You have a beautiful family. Thank you very much.

God, they're big. See, I'm used to chickens in Delaware. [Laughter] We've got a $4 billion industry in chickens, but there's no chicken that big, man. I tell you.

Just a few weeks ago, I visited another family farm in Minnesota where we talked about the pride of small towns and communities—rural communities—the pride that people have being able to know they can stay there and continue to keep their farms—and how, because of the investments we're making, we're restoring hope and opportunity so family farms can stay in the family and children don't have to leave home if they wish to stay and make a living on the farm.

Look, it matters.

And thanks to all of the families across America—who feed and fuel our Nation and the world, I might add. The world.

The national turkey presentation is—and pardon marks the unofficial start of the holiday season where, here in Washington—a time to share joy and gratitude and have a little bit of fun.

This is the 76th anniversary of this event. And I want you to know I wasn't there at the first one. [Laughter] I was too young to make it up. [Laughter]

One thing I want to make clear that was not clear then—you know, even though Liberty and Bell are from Minnesota, they're named for a famous Liberty Bell in Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. These birds have a new appreciation for the word ""Let Freedom Ring."" [Laughter]

So I'm told by the Turkey Federation of Liberty Bell—and Liberty and Bell, they love Honeycrisp apples—[applause]—not bad, huh?—ice hockey—[laughter]—I sure in hell would like to see them play ice hockey; 1,000 [10,000; White House correction] Lakes; and the Mall of America. [Laughter]

Now, just to get here, Liberty and Bell had to beat some tough odds—the competition. They had to work hard, show patience, and be willing to travel over a thousand miles.

You could say even it's harder than getting a ticket to the Renaissance Tour or—Britney's [Taylor's; White House correction] tour. She's down in—it's kind of warm in Brazil right now.

Look, folks, based on their commitment to being productive members of society, as they head to their new home at the University of Minnesota, I—are you going to bring them on up or do I do it there? That's a big bird, man. [Laughter] I'm impressed.

I hereby pardon Liberty and Bell. All right.

Congratulations, birds. Congratulations.

Look, now let me conclude, on a serious note, about why we have Thanksgiving in the first place: to remind ourselves—and we sometimes forget this—how we have so much to be thankful for as a nation.

This week, we'll gather with the people we love and the traditions that each of us have built up in our own families.

We'll also think about the loved ones we've lost, including just yesterday when we lost former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, who walked her own path, inspiring a nation and the world along the way.

And let's remind ourselves that we are blessed to live in the greatest nation on this face of the Earth.

That's what I see when I travel America. I've met so many incredible people who do such extraordinary things, including, just yesterday Jill and I visited the largest naval station in the world, Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia, to serve what they call ""Friendsgiving""—a Thanksgiving meal—to a thousand servicemen and their families. We owe them. We owe them big.

And to days ahead, our families and friends travel and come together to celebrate Thanksgiving, we can all give thanks to the gift that is our Nation.

And let's remember: We are the United States of America, and there is nothing—nothing, nothing—I mean this sincerely—nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. We've never come out of a situation, a bad circumstance not in—without being better off when we come through it. And this is always who we are as Americans.

So happy Thanksgiving. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

[At this point, the President left the podium and greeted audience members. He then answered a reporter's question as follows.]

Jill and I have been keeping all those held hostage and their loved ones close to our hearts these many weeks, and I am extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls, who have endured weeks of captivity and an unspeakable ordeal, will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented.

I thank Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar and President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt for their critical leadership and partnership in reaching this deal. And I appreciate the commitment that Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government have made in supporting an extended pause to ensure this deal can be fully carried out and to ensure the provision of additional humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of innocent Palestinian families in Gaza. I look forward to speaking with each of these leaders and staying in close contact as we work to ensure this deal is carried through in its entirety. It is important that all aspects of this deal be fully implemented.

As President, I have no higher priority than ensuring the safety of Americans held hostage around the world. That's why—from the earliest moments of Hamas's brutal assault—my national security team and I have worked closely with regional partners to do everything possible to secure the release of our fellow citizens. We saw the first results of that effort in late October, when two Americans were reunited with their loved ones. Today's deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released.

Today's deal is a testament to the tireless diplomacy and determination of many dedicated individuals across the United States Government to bring Americans home.""	Statement on the Release of Hostages Held by Hamas in Gaza, Palestinian Territories"

Hey, folks. We all set?

White House aide. Yes, sir.

The President. All right. Yesterday families all across America gathered together with their loved ones and to give thanks. We have much to be thankful for in America: the food on our tables, the family and loved ones in our homes, and the many blessings that come from living in the greatest nation on Earth.

And today we can also be thankful of families being recruited and reunited with loved ones who have been held hostage for nearly 50 days.

Beginning this morning, under a deal reached by extensive U.S. diplomacy, including numerous calls I've made from the Oval Office to leaders across the region, fighting in Gaza will halt for 4 days.

This deal also is structured to allow a pause to continue for more than 50 hostages to be released. That's our goal. This morning I've been engaged with my team as we began the first difficult days of implementing this deal.

It is only a start, but so far, it's gone well. Earlier this morning 13 Israeli hostages were released, including an elderly woman—a grandmother—and mothers with their young children, some under the age of 6 years old.

Separately, several Thai nationals and Filipino nationals who were also kidnapped by Hamas on the 7th, they were released as well.

All of these hostages have been through a terrible ordeal, and this is the beginning of a long journey of healing for them.

The teddy bears waiting to greet those children at the hospital are a stark reminder of the trauma these children have been through and at such a very young age. Jill and I—and Jill is with me here—are keeping them all in our prayers today.

Today—today—has been the product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement. From the moment Hamas kidnapped these people, I, along with my team, have worked around the clock to secure their release.

We saw the first results of this effort with the release of two American hostages in late October followed by the release of two Israeli hostages.

I have consistently pressed for a pause in the fighting for two reasons: to accelerate and expand the humanitarian assistance going into Gaza and, two, to facilitate the release of hostages.

And, over the past several weeks, I've spoken repeatedly with the Amir of Qatar, the President Elsisi of Egypt, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to help secure this deal, to nail it down. And I want to thank all three leaders for their personal partnership to get this done.

I spoke with the Amir and President Elsisi and the Prime Minister Netanyahu again on Wednesday to confirm the elements of the engagement.

As I said, today's release are the start of a process. We expect more hostages to be released tomorrow and more the day after and more the day after that. Over the next few days, we expect that dozens of hostages will be returned to their families.

We also remember all those who are still being held and renew our commitment to work for their release as well. Two American women and one 4-year-old child, Abigail, who remains among those missing. We also will not stop until we get these hostages brought home and an answer to their whereabouts.

I remain in personal contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt, and Israel to make sure this stays on track and every aspect of the deal is implemented.

You know, this extended pause in the fighting brings a critical opportunity to deliver much-needed food, medicine, water, and fuel to the civilians in Gaza, and we are not wasting one single minute. Since my trip to Israel last month, I've been focused on accelerating the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Gaza in coordination with the United Nations and the Red Cross.

I just spoke with my Special Envoy for the Middle East Humanitarian Issues, David Satterfield, for an update, and I've asked him to monitor our progress hour by hour and keep me personally informed. From the beginning, we've put in place mechanisms to prevent Hamas from diverting these supplies, and we're continuing that effort to make sure aid gets to the people who need it.

More than 200 trucks arrived at the crossing point in Egypt into Gaza today. These trucks carry food and medicine, as well as fuel and cooking gas. The fuel will be used not only to power the trucks delivering these lifesaving supplies, but the—for desalinization, for water wells, for hospitals, and for bakeries.

And hundreds more trucks are getting in position as well, ready to enter Gaza over the coming days to support the innocent Palestinians who are suffering greatly because of this war that Hamas has unleashed. Hamas doesn't give a damn about them.

We also look to the future. As we look to the future, we have to end this cycle of violence in the Middle East. We need to renew our resolve to pursue this two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can one day live side by side in a two-state solution with equal measure of freedom and dignity.

Two states for two peoples. And it's more important now than ever. Hamas unleashed this terrorist attack because they fear nothing more than Israelis and Palestinians living side by side in peace. You know, to continue down the path of terror and violence and killing and war is to give Hamas what they seek. And we can't do that.

So today let's continue to be thankful for all the families who are now and those who will soon be brought together again.

And I want to one—once again thank the Amir of Qatar, President Sisi of Egypt, and Prime Minister Netanyahu for their partnership to make what we've done so far possible and for their continued leadership as we all keep working to implement this deal.

And, over the coming days, I'll remain engaged with leaders throughout the Middle East as we all work together to build a better future for the region: a future where this kind of violence is unthinkable; a future where all children in the region—every child—Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Israeli, Palestinian, Arab—grow up knowing only peace. That's what we do.

We're waiting now—it will be just a matter of—I thought maybe even as soon as by the time I got here. But in the next hour or so, we'll know what the second wave of releases are. And I'm hopeful that it's as we anticipate.

So thank you all for listening. I'll take a few questions.

U.S. Citizens Among the Hostages Held by Hamas in Gaza 

Q. Mr. President, when will the first American hostages be released, since none were included today?

The President. We don't know when that will occur, but we're going to be—expect it to occur. And we don't know what the list of all the hostages are and when they'll be released, but we know the numbers that are going to be released. So it is my hope and expectation, it will be soon.

Q. And of the 10 Americans that are unaccounted for, do you know all of their conditions? Are they all alive?

The President. We don't know all their conditions.

Gaza Conflict/Israeli Military Operations 

Q. Mr. President, how long do you expect this war is going to take? And have you encouraged Prime Minister Netanyahu to set a timeline, say, by the end of this year?

The President. I've encouraged the Prime Minister to focus on trying to reduce the number of casualties while he is attempting to eliminate Hamas, which is a legitimate objective he has. That's a difficult task, and I don't know how long it will take.

My expectation and hope is that, as we move forward, the rest of the Arab world and the region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down, to bring this to an end as quickly as we can.

Q. Mr. President, do you trust Hamas to uphold their end of the deal?

Humanitarian Pause in the Gaza Conflict 

Q. Mr. President, what are the chances of this truce could be extended by a few days or more?

The President. I think the chances are real.

U.S. Assistance to Israel 

Q. Mr. President, there are members of your party who would like to see conditions placed on aid to Israel. What is your view on that? They would like to see, you know, a reduction in the bombing and that sort of thing.

The President. Well, I think that's a worthwhile thought, but I don't think if I started off with that we'd ever gotten to where we are today.

Q. Mr. President——

The President. We have to take this a piece at a time.

Hamas 

Q. Mr. President, do you trust Hamas to uphold their end of the deal?

The President. I don't trust Hamas to do anything right. I only trust Hamas to respond to pressure.

Arab-Israel Conflict/Peace Process/Hamas Attacks Against Israel

Q. Mr. President, you said you were hoping to get cooperation from Arab leaders. What are you hearing from them when you talk to them? What would you like to see them do?

The President. I'm hearing a lot, but I'm not going to speak to it right now. There's an overwhelming desire on the part of the region to—let me back up. I'm—I cannot prove what I'm about to say, but I believe one of the reasons why Hamas struck when they did was they knew that I was working very closely with the Saudis and others in the region to bring peace to the region by having recognition of Israel and Israel's right to exist.

You may recall when we did the G-20 about—a little while ago, I was able to get a resolution—I—a statement passed through there saying we were going to build a railroad from Riyadh all the way through the Middle East into Saudi Arabia, Israel, et cetera, and all the way up to Europe. Not the railroad, but it would be an underground pipeline and then railroad.

The whole idea is, there's overwhelming interest—and I think most Arab nations know it—in coordinating with one another to change the dynamic in their region for a longer term peace. And that is what I'm going to continue to work on.

Thank you all very, very much. I appreciate it.

Q. Thank you, Mr. President.

The President. Thank you.

Q. Happy Thanksgiving.

The President. Happy Thanksgiving to you all. [Laughter] I hope you enjoyed it.""	Remarks on the Release of Hostages Held by Hamas in Gaza, Palestinian Territories, and an Exchange With Reporters in Nantucket, Massachusetts"
"Nov 26, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-release-hostages-held-hamas-gaza-palestinian-territories-and-exchange-with-0,"Remarks on the Release of Hostages Held by Hamas in Gaza, Palestinian Territories, and an Exchange With Reporters in Nantucket, Massachusetts","""The President. Morning, everyone. How are you?
Two days ago—2 days ago—one of our fellow Americans, a little girl named Abigail, turned 4 years old. She spent her birthday—that birthday—and at least 50 days before that held hostage by Hamas.
Today she is free. And Jill and I, together with so many Americans, are praying for the fact that she is going to be all right. You know, she's free, and she's in Israel now.
And so those who are now wrapping Abigail in the love and care and the supportive services she needs—she's been through a terrible trauma. You know, her mom was killed in front of her when her kibbutz was attacked by Hamas terrorists on October the 7th.
Abigail ran to her dad then, who then was gunned down—gunned down as well—while using his body to shield little Abigail.
She then ran to a neighbor for help, where they were all taken hostage—the—that entire house of neighbors were taken hostage by Hamas and held for 50 days. What she endured is unthinkable.
Abigail was among 13 hostages released today from Gaza under the [deal; White House correction] brokered and sustained though [through; White House correction] intensive U.S. diplomacy. She's now safely in Israel, and we continue to press and expect for additional Americans will be released as well. And we will not stop working until every hostage is returned to their loved ones.
As I said when I spoke about this deal on Friday, this has been the product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement from me and my team. We have been in close contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt, and Israel, speaking with each one of them repeatedly over the past few weeks to help secure this deal.
We spoke again yesterday with the Amir of Qatar—I owe a special thanks to—in order to keep the hostage release on track and push for Abigail to be part of this release. And I'll be speaking again shortly with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And we will continue to remain personally engaged—personally engaged—to see that this deal is fully implemented and work to extend the deal as well.
For weeks, I have been advocating a pause in the fighting for two purposes: to increase the assistance getting in to the Gaza civilians who need help and to facilitate release of hostages.
And we know that innocent children in Gaza are suffering greatly as well because this war that Hamas has unleashed is so—has such consequences. Thousands have been killed.
And from the earliest days of this crisis, I've worked closely with President Sisi of Egypt, the Israeli Government, King Abdullah of Jordan, and leaders throughout the region to expand the delivery of critical humanitarian assistance to help innocent Palestinians in need, who are not part of Hamas.
Under this deal, fighting in Gaza has now been paused for 3 days. Over that time, 58 hostages have been released, including Thai, Filipino, and Russian nationals. Dozens of families have been reunited.
And we worked urgently—urgently—to take advantage of the pause to surge aid into Gaza. We have moved approximately 200 aid trucks into Gaza each day loaded with food, water, medicine, fuel, and cooking gas. More is needed, but this deal is delivering lifesaving results.
Critically needed aid is going in, and hostages are coming out.
And this deal is structured so that it can be extended to keep building on these results. That's my goal—that's our goal: to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into those in need in Gaza.
We have seen this is the day-by-day approach—hour-by-hour process. Nothing is guaranteed. And nothing is being taken for granted.
But the proof that this is working and worth pursuing further is in every smile and every grateful tear we see on the faces of those families who are finally getting back together again. The proof is little Abigail.
And more than 20 other children, 18 years and younger, have been released. They've been released through this deal as well. They have endured a terrible ordeal, and they can now begin the long journey toward healing.
And I'm going to continue working with the Amir of Qatar, President Sisi of Egypt, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to do everything possible to see the hostages are freed, all the hostages. I'm grateful for the personal partnership as we pursued this deal—from each of those men I just mentioned—and as we have worked together to see the—see all this implemented and now to try to extend it further.
I'll continue working with all our partners to take the hard, but necessary steps to build an integrated and more prosperous and more peaceful future in the region.
A two-state solution is the only way to guarantee the long-term security of both Israelis and Palestinian people, to make sure Israel and Palestinians alike live in equal measure of freedom and dignity.
We will not give up on working toward that goal.
So thank you very much.
But thank God she's home, the little child—[laughter]—I just can't imagine the enjoyment in the—I just—I wish I was there to hold her.
U.S. Citizens Among the Hostages Held by Hamas in Gaza 
Q. Mr. President, do you have an update on the other Americans who are being held and any sense as to when they would be released?
The President. We are hopeful, but I don't have anything firmly to tell you at this moment.
Terms of the Hostage Release Agreement/International Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. Sir, do you expect that if you are able to use this momentum to extend the pause, have you extracted any guarantees about proof of life for other hostages? Or do you have an expectation of how much longer you can push this pause?
The President. Well, look, you know, the deal calls for—for every 10 hostages released to extend another day. So I'm hopeful this is not the end, that it's going to continue. But we don't know.
And—but I get a sense that all the players in the region, even the neighbors who aren't—and have been directly involved now, are looking for a way to end this so the hostages are all released and Hamas is completely—how can I say it?—no longer in control of any portion of Gaza.
Remaining Hostages Held in Gaza 
Q. And do they have control of all of the hostages? Are there still other militant groups that you have to deal with?
The President. We think there are probably other militant groups, but we're not certain.
Condition of Released Hostages/Release Process 
Q. Mr. President—Mr. President, how is Abigail doing? What's her physical condition? Do you have any information on—
The President. Well, I haven't gotten that information. I just wanted to let you know immediately.
They were going across into Egypt, as you recall. That was the route. But an older, non-American, elderly—elderly woman is very sick and was in need of immediate medical help, so they arranged to cross directly into Israel to be able to take her to a hospital.
All I know is that she was being held. [Laughter] I don't know. I haven't seen a photograph. I've just been in communication with my team. But she is safely ensconced in Israel. But there's a lot more work to be done.
Humanitarian Pause in the Fighting in Gaza 
Q. How many days would you like to see the pause go on for?
The President. I would like to see us move to a point where we were able to—well, let me put it this way: I'd like to see the pause go on as long as prisoners kept coming out.
All right. Thank you all so very much. I know——
Q. Thank you, sir.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. ——you know, we have to call you—I know you say, ""Why is he calling me with only 10 minutes or so notice?"" [Laughter] I said, ""That's the notice I get."" Because we didn't know—I didn't want to be having this press conference if they weren't physically—even when they were in the Red Cross ambulance, I didn't want to do it because they were not out. They weren't—they were still in Gaza.
So I don't thank you enough, but thanks for your patience. And I—I know——
Q. You can call us anytime.
Q. Anytime, sir.
Q. We're here anytime, sir.

Thus far, more than 50 hostages have now been released and returned to their families. Those released include young children, mothers, and grandmothers. One of them was a little American girl, Abigail, who turned 4 years old while in captivity after her parents were killed in front of her and she was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on October 7. I spoke with Abigail's family following her release, and we are working closely with our Israeli partners to ensure she gets the care and support she needs as she begins to recover from this unspeakable trauma.

The humanitarian pause has also enabled a significant surge in additional humanitarian assistance to the innocent civilians who are suffering across the Gaza strip. The United States has led the humanitarian response into Gaza, building on years of work as the largest funder of humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people. We are taking full advantage of the pause in fighting to increase the amount of humanitarian aid moving into Gaza, and we will continue our efforts to build a future of peace and dignity for the Palestinian people.

Today I want to again thank Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, and President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi of Egypt for their commitment to this process and in reaching the agreement for an extension over the next 48 hours. We will not stop until all of the hostages held by Hamas terrorists are released.""	Statement on the Extension of the Humanitarian Pause in the Fighting in Gaza, Palestinian Territories"

Among them, is Liat Beinin: a high school teacher, a guide at Israel's Holocaust Museum Yad Vashem, and an American. Jill and I are deeply gratified that she will soon be reunited with her three children and her father, who have been wracked with worry for her safety. And we remain determined to secure the release of every person taken hostage by Hamas during its brutal terrorist assault on Israel on October 7, including Liat's husband Aviv.

The deal to pause the fighting in Gaza and facilitate the release of hostages—a deal the United States worked intensively to secure, sustain, and extend—is now in its sixth day. This deal has delivered meaningful results. Nearly 100 hostages have been returned to their loved ones. And the United States has led the international community to use this pause to accelerate the delivery of additional humanitarian assistance into Gaza. More than 200 trucks loaded with aid, including food, water, medicine, shelter supplies, fuel, and cooking gas, have entered Gaza each of the last few days. For the first time since this conflict began, aid reached northern Gaza. And yesterday the United States airlifted more than 54,000 pounds of medical equipment and food aid to the humanitarian distribution center in Egypt, the first of three deliveries of critical supplies that will go to civilians in Gaza who need our help.

I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, and President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi of Egypt for their continued partnership in this process and their ongoing commitment to bring every hostage home and to get more aid to the innocent people of Gaza.""

"Dec 05, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-reception-weston-massachusetts,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Weston, Massachusetts","""The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, please have a seat.

I want to thank all of you for making this run possible.

There's two people I particularly want to thank in here, Andre and Roman. Where are you guys? Stand up. These guys—these guys sold—stood on a—on the corner—well, not the corner, on the street near their home for—how many weeks?

Audience member. Ten.

The President. Ten weeks, 30 hours a week, selling—it was a cake, wasn't it?

Audience member. Lemon bars and brownies.

The President. Lemon bars and brownies. They raised $4,000 for my campaign. Fellas, thank you, thank you, thank you. I truly—I really appreciate it.

To Susan and Ambassador Alan—Mr. Ambassador, I tell you what, we've been hanging out a while. And I can't thank you enough for that introduction and for all you've done to help me and our whole administration.

And a big thank you to all of you.

You know, I was raised by what the Jewish community refers to as a ""righteous Christian."" My dad—[laughter]. No, I'm serious. My dad was a Catholic, like our family is.

And—but he used to come home. He ran an automobile dealership. He didn't own it; he ran it. He'd come home for dinner every night and then go back and close things up. And our dinner table was the place where we sat down to have conversation and, incidentally, eat as kids. I'm serious about that.

My dad used to rave about—rage about the fact that—why would they not let that ship full of Jewish—American Jews come into America from Germany; why, in fact, we didn't bond the railroad tracks on the way to the death camp.

My dad was a well-read high school graduate. He never got a chance to go to college. And he talked about obligation all the time, for real. And so, when I—I apologize for telling this story again to a couple of you, but—when my—each of my children and each my grandchildren reach the age of 14, the first thing I did after their birthday was put them on an—[inaudible]—and take them to Dachau with me because I want them to see the concentration camp. I wanted them to understand what had happened. I mean, for real. Every one of them. I have two left to go to take with me.

Because my dad also—this is a phrase that's not unique to him, but known to all of you, and that is: Silence is complicity. Silence is complicity.

And so, I've been—I've known every Prime Minister well since Golda Meir. The first time I sat with Golda, there was a guy sitting next to me named Rabin who was her assistant. That's how far back I go. And I've been a strong, strong supporter of Israel from the time I've entered the United States Senate back in 1973.

And you know, it is—as I—as I said, there's a story I tell that—my meeting with Golda after the Six-Day War. She was—I was—went to see her. And she was flipping those maps up and down in her office, and she was going on. And all of the sudden, she looked at me and said, ""Would you like a photograph?"" [Laughter] And many of you have been to the office. If you walk outside the officer, there's, like, a hallway that's mostly circular, outside.

And we said, ""Let's go have a photograph."" So I got up, walked there. I'm standing next to her, and we're both standing silently, looking at the photographers.

And we didn't—she didn't turn to me, but she just spoke to me. She said, ""Why do you look so sad?""—after she just described the end of Judaism for me. [Laughter] And I said—and I started to respond, and I decided I shouldn't.

And she looked at me and said: ""Don't worry, we have a secret weapon. We have a secret weapon in our fight."" And then I did turn. And I swear to God this is a true story. I recorded it at the time. I said, ""What is that?"" She said, ""We have no place else to go."" And I think that's the truth.

Without an Israel that's free and secure, I don't think there's a single Jew in the world that would be fully secure. That's why I've been such an overwhelming supporter. I got in trouble many times for saying you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist, and I am a Zionist. I make no apologies for that. That's a reality.

But you know, when this last event occurred on the 6th [7th; White House correction], I spent—I immediately got on the plane and went over to Israel to meet with Bibi with his Cabinet.

And I've known Bibi for 50 years. There's a photograph he keeps on his desk—at least when I'm there, he puts it on the desk—[laughter]—and it's 8.5 by 11. It's a picture where he was a young member of the Israeli office in Washington and—Ambassadorship—and I was a young Senator. And I—it was 8.5 by 11, and I wrote in the top. I said, ""Bibi, I love you, but I don't agree with a damn thing you have to say."" [Laughter]

We share a strong, strong support for Israel, but I think there's going to be a real—we were—we have to figure: What after Gaza? What after Gaza?

And one of the things that I think is important—and I've spent hours with the Qataris—hours—to broker and sustain and extend the deal of a pause, the fighting to get the hostages home. More than 100 hostages got out. More than 100. And we're not going to stop working until we get everyone out.

But you know what? In the meantime, I was all—able to convince the Israelis that we had to allow significant more aid into Gaza. And we got up to the point where we were about 150 trucks a day.

But when—when Hamas decided they were ending the—ending the release of hostages, not keeping the deal, and everything fell apart. And we have to get it back on track.

And in my view, and I know a lot of you have real interest in Israel. We can—I could do the whole speech—my whole talk about Israel, but I'm just going to end by saying: I've been working with a number of people in and out of government to figure out what after—what after Gaza. And I think the only ultimate solution is a two-state solution. I've been—I've had that view for a long, long time.

I know Bibi doesn't, and I know others don't. But we're having constant conversations about it.

And I've been very—those of you who know me, and a number of you do know me well, I've been very straightforward and blunt with our Israeli friends in private about what I think they have to do and the burden they have and the commitment they have from me and my administration.

So there's going to be a lot more we have to figure out. And I think that—I just want you to know that I'm not walking away. My administration is not walking away. And I know you're not walking away either.

We could talk a lot more about this, but I just wanted to say that at the outset.

Now, why I'm here today: to say thank you. Thank you, and we need you. [Laughter] We need you.

You know, just think about where we were 4 years ago and we are today.

When I came to office, the pandemic was raging, the economy was reeling. In 4 years, Donald Trump lost more jobs than he created. The only other President that that ever occurred to was Herbert Hoover. That's why I occasionally call him ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. [Laughter]

But all kidding aside, since then, we've made incredible progress, some of which was mentioned a moment ago. We've created 14 million new jobs. More jobs than any—have ever been created by a President a 4-year term, let alone 2½ years.

Record economic growth at 5 percent this last quarter. Record low unemployment—21 straight months of unemployment below 4 percent. And today, the lowest inflation rate of any industrialized nation in the world.

We also confirmed more Federal judges at a historic pace, first Black woman on the Supreme Court.

More women—and by the way, I said—committed my administration would look like America. I have more women in my Cabinet than men, more women in my administration than men. That's because the women in my life are all smarter than me. [Laughter] But no, all kidding aside, it's a—and we have a significant number of African Americans, Hispanics. And we just—because it should look like America.

We passed the biggest investment in history to combat climate change and—putting us on course to be 100-percent clean energy electricity by 2035 and meeting the 1.5-degree goal.

The biggest investment of rebuilding America's infrastructure since his—President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System. And you know, roads, bridges, clean water, high-speed internet, all—and cheap for people, available to people.

And by the way, when we were talking about Boebert and her district—I love these guys—[laughter]—it's so much fun to go into their district where they celebrate all that's been done, all of which they voted against. [Laughter]

But I promised I'd be a President for all of Americans, whether they voted for me or not. And we're moving the country.

We've rebuilt our alliances that Trump had so badly damaged around the world. And those of you who travel internationally know I'm not exaggerating. That's not hyperbole.

Madeleine Albright was correct. America is the essential nation. The rest of the world looks to us. I could go on.

But today I want to talk about this election and what it's fundamentally about. The future American democracy, I believe, and I've believed for some time is literally at risk. Like I said, I know it don't look it; I'm only 40 years old but—[laughter]—40 times 2 and 1. [Laughter]

But all kidding aside, I first raised the alarm about American democracy back in the first campaign in 2020. I made a speech in Independence Hall. I've repeatedly spoken about the risk to democracy than Trump poses.

In fact, I was attacked in 2022 midterms for spending so much time talking about the threats to American democracy. While the pundits didn't understand, the voters understood it—what I was saying. The election deniers were defeated all over America.

And now when people look back at 2020, they know I wasn't exaggerating. And thank God, because of people like you, we won in 2020. And I'm not being—it's not hyperbole: because the people like you in this room who gave me the ability to fight the campaign.

I might add, we won more votes than any Presidential candidate in American history: 81 million votes. And now I don't think anyone doubts democracy is more at risk in 2024 than it was in 2020. And I mean that. Because this time we're running against an election denier in chief.

Trump is not even hiding the ball anymore. He's simply not hiding the ball. He's telling us what he wants to do. He's proud to say he killed Roe v. Wade by the court he appointed. He's running again to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.

I could go on. But let's be clear about the side—what's at stake in 2024: Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy. And that, again, is not hyperbole. That's a fact. The former President makes no bones about it. Don't take my word for it. Just listen to what he has to say.

To his supporters, he says, ""2024 is the final battle."" He goes on to say, ""I am your retribution."" ""I am your retribution."" And he talks about being—we're on a—we're part of ""a failing nation."" ""Either they win or we win. If they win, we no longer have a country.""

When did you ever hear a President of the United States say any of those things—speak anything like that? Trump proudly proclaims himself an election denier. He's the only losing candidate in American history to refuse to accept the will of the people. He didn't even show up at my Inauguration. I can't say it disappointed me, but he didn't. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Think about that. First President in American history wouldn't show up.

The same man who encouraged supporters to go to the Capitol on January 6, who for hours sat in the dining room next to my Oval Office watching—watching—them threaten his own Vice President, who refused to break his oath. The Vice President refused to break his oath to the Constitution.

And now, the same man is promising to pardon—pardons for those convicted felons and insurrectionists. The same man who said it was time, and I quote, to—""termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution."" He's not saying this privately. He's saying it publicly. He's attracting supporters by this language.

Now his supporters are saying he should invoke the Insurrection Act to use the military—the U.S. military domestically—domestically to political opponents and in American cities. If he's returned to office, he said he was going to go after all those who oppose him, root out when he called the ""vermin"" in America—not a word often used except in Nazi Germany—a specific phrase with a specific meaning. And it echoes the language heard out of Germany in the thirties.

Did you ever think you'd hear a President of the United States speak like that? Not a joke. I—I don't care if you're Democrat, Republican, in—who—whatever your background is.

And then the House once again turned to—to its radical right to a new Speaker, using it as a weapon—using a weapon, the agenda he likes to accomplish. Now, we've already rejected the majority of the American people in the Republican agenda in the House. Can't even get through the Republicans in the Senate.

Trump's new Speaker supports a national ban on abortion under any circumstances, just as we've seen the radical bans in States all across America. And just in the last few days, the Republican legislature in New Hampshire has come forward in proposal of a 15-day ban—a 15-day ban. After 15 days, all abortions are banned for whatever reason—not 15 weeks, 15 days.

Look, Trump has vowed again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would mean 40 million Americans' insurance—40 million immediately. You know that, Doc. Forty million. Parents couldn't get their kid—keep their kids on their policies if they're under the age of 26. They'd all be off the policy. One hundred million Americans with preexisting conditions would be denied health insurance—100 million.

And folks, that's what a stake in American democracy.

You know, we need to meet the moment once again. And all of you understand what freedom means: Tell the truth, have a little bit of courage, hold a mirror up to the Nation and yourself. Ask, you know: ""Is this who we are? Can we do any better?""

We don't believe America is dark and negative. We don't believe in a nation of carnage, driven by anger, fear, and revenge. We don't believe that.

We believe we're a hopeful, optimistic nation, driven by the simple proposition that everybody deserves an even shot. We believe this country—the one we live in—is really special.

We're the most unique nation in the world. That sounds like hyperbole. You know, you'd expect, as President, I'd say that, but it's true. We're the most unique nation in the world.

We're the only nation in the world not built on ethnicity, religion, and geography. We're built on an idea, the only nation built on an idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal, endowed by—you know the rest.

We all deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We've never met that goal completely, but we've never fully walked away from it. You know—but that's what Trump wants to do. We're not going to walk away now.

Let me close with this. Every generation of Americans has had to fight to protect our democracy in some way or another. Now it's our time, our turn.

We need—indeed, we need every American—Democrat, Republican, Independent—who loves democracy to join us in 2024. I really mean it. When we do that, we'll have done something few generations have an opportunity to do. That is, we will have saved American democracy.

And those of you who've known me for a long time, you know I'm not given to much hyperbole. I may talk too long, but I'm not given to much hyperbole. [Laughter]

But look, this is a fact. I know we can do this. I've never been more optimistic about America than I am today, and I really mean it.

We're at a real inflection point in history. The decision we made in the last few years and the next 4 years are going to determine what we look like the next five or six decades.

It's a whole new era.

We have to remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America, for God's sake. And there's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together.

And, folks, I know that sounds like hyperbole again, to use it for the third time. But the fact is, think about it: We're the only nation in the world you can name for me that's come out of every crisis stronger than they went in—stronger than we went in.

When I was Vice President, President Obama asked me to get to know Xi Jinping because he was Vice President. So I traveled, overall, 17,000 miles with him. Just he and I, each with a simultaneous interpreter. We were on the Tibetan Plateau, and he turned to me, and he asked me a question.

He said, ""Can you define America for me?"" I said, ""Yes, I can—one word""—and I meant it. ""One word: possibilities. Possibilities.""

The reason why when you travel the world, they sometimes talk about the ""ugly American"" being so self-confident: We've never thought anything is beyond our capacity, from curing cancer this time around to everything we've ever done.

I really mean it. I don't think there's anything beyond our capacity when we do it together.

But I tell you what: If we don't win this time—not because I'm running, and I know it sounds like a self-serving assertion, but there's a new article—there's a new magazine—not new magazine. The Atlantic magazine has a new issue out with 20 major articles by 20 different individuals—20 different commentators or academics—all making the case why American democracy is at risk. Twenty of them—Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.

Folks, this is a big deal, this election. We've got to get it done—not because of me, and I mean that. If Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure I'd be running. But we cannot let him win, for the sake of the country.

God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.""	Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Weston, Massachusetts"
"Dec 05, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-reception-boston-massachusetts,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Boston, Massachusetts","""Hello. Hello, everybody. [Laughter] Well, thank you, thank you. Please have a seat. Please have a seat. [Laughter] God, it's good to see you all.

And, Jack, thank you, but I know the real movement in here is Eileen. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, thank you very, very much for the introduction and for hosting this event.

And a big thanks to all of you.

You know, before I begin, let me say a few words about the—what's going on in Israel right now—the terror that Hamas is continuing to inflict on the Israeli people.

We had a report early—in the earliest days that Hamas used rape as—terrorized women and girls during the attack on October the 7th in Israel.

And over the past few weeks, survivors and witnesses of the attacks have shared the horrific accounts of unimaginable cruelty: reports of women raped—repeatedly raped and their bodies being mutilated while still alive, of women corpses being desecrated, and Hamas terrorists inflicting as much pain and suffering as—on women and girls as possible and then murdering them. And it's appalling.

Ending violence against women and sexual assault has been one of the causes of my life. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act as a Senator and one of my proudest legislative achievements.

But the world can't just look away—what's going on. It's on all of us—the government, international organizations, civil society, individual citizens—to forcefully condemn the sexual violence of Hamas terrorists without equivocation—without equivocation, without exception.

There are—these are civilian women, mostly between the ages of 20 and 39 whom—Hamas has refused to let go under the deal that paused the fighting, which I helped negotiate through the Qataris. I spent hours with the Qataris and others to broker, sustain, and extend that deal. We got more than 100 hostages out.

But let me be crystal clear: Hamas's refusal to release the remaining young women is what broke this deal and ended the pause in the fighting.

These women and everyone still being held hostage by Hamas need to be returned to their families immediately. We're not going to stop. We're not going to stop working until we bring every one of them home, and it's going to be a long process, possibly.

Now, for the reason that I'm here today, specifically, is to thank you all. You know, when I came to office, the pandemic was raging, and the economy was reeling.

In the 4 years Donald Trump was President—and he's the only President other than Herbert Hoover who actually lost jobs in a 4-year period. And that's why I often—think of him as Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. [Laughter]

But all kidding aside, since then, we've made incredible progress with your help—record progress. We've created 14 million new jobs, more jobs than have ever been created by any President in a 4-year term.

Record economic growth—5 percent last quarter alone. Record low unemployment—21 straight months of under 4-percent unemployment. And today, we have the lowest inflation rate of every—any major economy in the world.

And with the help of Marty Walsh——

[At this point, the President briefly imitated a Boston accent.]

Marty is not here right now. He couldn't be here, but he set unprecedented movement to empower American workers.

Look what happened with the UAW—where, by the way, I was proud to be the first President to walk the picket line. I make no apologies for that. Look at other unions like the Teamsters and the writers and actors in Hollywood and more. After years of seeing all the profits they helped create go to others, workers—workers—are now getting their fair share. I think it's about time.

We've also confirmed Federal judges at a historic pace, thanks in large part to Dick—Dick Durbin, the chairman of the committee of the—in—from Illinois—including the first Black woman Supreme Court Justice, as I promised.

We passed the biggest investment in the history of the world to combat climate change, putting us on a path to 100-percent clean electricity by 2035.

The biggest investment of rebuilding America's infrastructure since President Eisenhower's rebuilding of the roads and highways and bridges and with the Interstate Highway System. And we've done the same now delivering clean water, high-speed internet to every American, and cheaply.

We've rebuilt our alliances that Trump damaged so badly around the world. Madeleine Albright was correct; we are the essential nation. It's a responsibility, but it's also the truth.

I could go on, but today I want to talk about what this election is fundamentally about. The future of American democracy—it's not hyperbole—is literally at risk. The future of American democracy is literally at risk.

I first raised the alarm bells about Donald Trump's threat to democracy back when I ran in 2020. I spoke at Independence Hall and made a speech about why I thought it was at stake. And I've spoken to it repeatedly ever since.

In fact, I was attacked in 2022 in the midterms for spending so much time talking about the threats to American democracy. But while the pundits—what they didn't understand—but the voters heard what I was saying. The election deniers were defeated all over America.

And now, when people talk about—look back on 2020, I don't think they thought I was exaggerating about the threat to democracy. And thank God, because of the people like you, we won in 2020. And that's not hyperbole. Because of you in the audience, we won in 2020.

I might add, we won with more votes than any Presidential candidate has ever gotten in American history: 81 million votes.

Almost like somebody's age. I don't know how that—[inaudible]. [Laughter] It's hell turning 40 twice.

But now I don't think anyone doubts our democracy is even more at risk in 2024. And I'm serious. Because this time, we're running against an election denier in chief.

Trump's not even hiding the ball anymore. He's telling us exactly what he wants to do. He's making no bones about it. He's proud to say he killed Roe v. Wade. Because of the Court he appointed, he killed Roe v. Wade. He's running again to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. I could go on.

But let's be clear about what's at stake in 2024. Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy. And, again, I say it the second time. I believe that with every fiber of my being. And the former President makes no bones about it.

Don't take my word for it. Listen to what he's actually saying these days. He's saying it out loud. He says, ""2024 is the final battle."" He goes on to say, ""I am your retribution."" He talks about, quote, ""We're a failing nation."" He goes on to say—and these are all quotes—""Either they win or we win. And if they win, we no longer have a country.""

Trump proudly proclaims himself an election denier. You know, he's the only losing candidate in American history to—not to accept the will of the American people. He didn't even show up at my Inauguration. He never even showed up. I can't say I was disappointed, but he never showed up. [Laughter]

The same man who encouraged supporters to go to the Capitol on January 6, who for hours sat in the private dining room I have off the Oval Office watching him threaten his own Vice President who refused to break his oath to the Constitution.

And now, the same man promising pardons to those convicted felons and insurrectionists—""if I'm elected""—he's going to pardon them. That's what he says.

The same man who said it was time for, and I quote, ""termination of all rules, regulation, and articles, even those . . . in the Constitution."" This guy means it, and he's saying it out loud.

Now his supporters are saying he should invoke the Insurrection Act—you know, the use of the U.S. military on domestic soil—against political opponents to—and in American cities.

One of the great chairs of the—the joint chairmen of the—of the United States military just retired. He said he's a ""traitor,"" should be tried as one.

If—he said—if he's returned to office, he said he'll go after those who oppose him and root out what he called the ""vermin."" American vermin. A phrase you may recall from history used in the thirties in another country—a specific phrase with a specific meaning, and it echoes the language you've heard in Germany in the thirties.

And it wasn't the first time he used the language of the thirties. Trump also said—and he talked about, quote, ""the blood of our country is being poisoned."" ""The blood of our country is being poisoned."" What in God's name is going on? Another phrase from the same era.

You don't even—ever think you'd hear a President of the United States speaking like that, but he's saying it. And the worst part is he means it. He means it.

You know, at the House, once again, he turned to radical right—they turned to radical right with a new Speaker. Using any weapon they can to get the agenda they've already—been rejected. They already committed they would not try to get again, and they already are violating, for the third time, their commitment. The majority of American people and the majority of Members of the Congress have rejected it.

Trump's new Speaker supports a national ban on abortion under any circumstances. And as we've just seen, radical bans in States all across America have been supported by them.

Just as in the last few days, the Republican legislature in New Hampshire has put forward for approval a 15-day ban on any abortion—15 days, not 15 weeks. Fifteen days.

And Trump has vowed again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would mean 40 million Americans would lose their health insurance, parents couldn't keep their kids on their insurance plans up to—under age 26, and 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions could be denied health insurance. It's the 51st time they will have tried it. Not a joke.

Extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress will not support the essential assistance to Ukraine unless we follow the most draconian actions possible to keep immigrants out of America, building walls and the like.

On my very first day, I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress asking for a significant increase in the number of folks at the border—a significant increase in all the security we needed in terms of ti-tech [high-tech; White House correction] stuff.

But the Republicans refused to act. They wouldn't act—they won't act on it. I don't think they want to solve it. I think they want to keep it as a problem without the tools to make it any better.

And, folks, to the—the point is, I'm no longer the only one making the case that Trump is a threat to democracy. Voters understand. Liz Cheney is a powerful voice raising the alarm.

Atlantic magazine this month put out a magazine—20 separate individual pieces by 20 leading Americans separately talking about—across the political spectrum—outlining the threats that Donald Trump poses to our democracy.

I've been around a while in politics, and I never thought I'd run in an election like this. Folks, that's what's at stake. American democracy—I give you my word as a Biden—I believe, is at stake. We need the moment. We need to meet it again—once again.

All of you understand what freedom means: Tell the truth, have a little courage, hold a mirror up to the Nation. And ask: ""Is this who we are? Can we do better? Is this who we want to be?""

We don't believe America is a dark and negative nation, a nation of carnage driven by anger, fear, and hatred or revenge. We believe we're a hopeful, optimistic nation. We've always been—as much as we disagreed—driven by a simple proposition that everybody deserves a fair shot. No one is guaranteed—just a fair shot.

We believe this country we live in is so special because we are. We are the most unique country in the history of the world, organized on a principle no other nation has been organized on. We're the only nation not built on ethnicity, religion, geography. We're the only nation built on an idea. And that's not hyperbole. Think about it. The only nation in the history of the world built on an idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, et cetera, et cetera, and deserve an equal opportunity throughout their lives.

We've never fully lived up to that by any stretch of the imagination, but we've never walked away from it before. We've never walked away from it before like Trump wants to do, and we're not going to walk away now.

So let me close—and I'm keeping you too long. I apologize. But every generation of Americans has had to fight to protect our democracy to some degree or another. Now is our time. We need you. We need every American who loves democracy to join us in 2024 to make sure that we make our democracy stronger, not weaker and jeopardized.

When we do that, we'll have done something few generations have been able to do: We'll be able to say we saved American democracy. It sounds like hyperbole, but really and truly.

Going back to the nuns when I was growing up and going to school: Examine your conscience. Not a joke. Think about it. For real. What does this guy mean to democracy? He's the antithesis of what it means.

I know we can do this. And I've never been—I—you heard me say this before, and I mean it. I've never been more optimistic about America's prospects than I have now—as a Senator, as a Vice President, as a professor of Penn, as President.

We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We are the United States of America. There's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity. Nothing.

I've traveled with Xi Jinping more than—and I met with him alone more than any other world leader has, because when I was Vice President, he was Vice President. We knew he was going to be President. And the President of the United States said to me, ""You've got to get to know him, because we've got to have somebody who knows him well.""

I traveled 17,000 miles with him throughout China and the United States. And I asked him—he asked me on the Tibetan Plateau—he asked me a question. And all we had was an individual interpreter, he—each one—one of us—simultaneous interpretation and the—and two of us.

And he looked at me and he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I give you my word this is true. I said, ""Yes. In one word: possibilities. Possibilities.""

We've never thought anything was beyond our capacity, for God's sake. Think about it. That's who we are: possibilities. And there's so many possibilities to make our Nation and the world better. And there's no better nation to do it. No one else will do it but us.

I've known the vast majority of the world leaders. I've traveled in 144 countries. I've known them for a while. That's because I've been around a while. And, folks, the rest of the world looks at us that way too. They look at us that way too. Not a joke.

You'll be amazed at how many of my fellow world leaders inquire about are we going to be okay. We're going to be okay because of you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.""	Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Boston, Massachusetts"

Q. Mr. President, would you be running if Trump wasn't running? Would you be running for President if Trump wasn't running?

The President. I expect so. But look, he is running, and I just—I have to run.

Q. Would you drop out if Trump runs out?

The President. No, not now.

Hostages Held in Gaza, Palestinian Territories 

Q. What's the latest on the American hostages in Gaza?

The President. We're pushing hard. We're talking to the Qataris. I don't know where it's going to go, but we're not giving up.

Q. Does Hamas have all eight of them, or are other groups holding them too?

The President. Well, there's others. But we—look, I'm not going to talk more about it. But we're not walking away.

U.S. Assistance to Ukraine 

Q. Have you spoken to anyone on the Hill about Ukraine funding?

The President. Yes, a couple. And look, the failure to support Ukraine is just absolutely crazy. It's against U.S. interests. It's against the interests of the world. It's just wrong. And we're going to get that—we're going to get that aid. We're going to get it.

So, anyways, thank you all for waiting. Appreciate it.""	Remarks in an Exchange With Reporters Upon Arrival From Boston, Massachusetts"
"Dec 06, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-statement-1,Joint Statement—Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders Statement,"""We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), met virtually on December 6, 2023, to address global challenges and shape a course for a better future. We reaffirm our commitment made at the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, which is a city that suffered an atomic bombing and now has become a symbol of peace. We were joined by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. We remain committed to upholding the rule of law, which protects all nations, especially the vulnerable, as well as global security and human dignity in all parts of the world. We are more united than ever in the pursuit of international peace, prosperity and sustainable development, and have strengthened our engagement with international partners beyond the G7. We thank the Japanese Presidency for their leadership across this year.
Ukraine 
For 650 days, the Ukrainian people have bravely resisted Russia's illegal aggression. We salute their courage and their resilience, and express our full sympathy and condolences for those suffering. We pay tribute to the sacrifices made by Ukraine to preserve its freedom and the values we share. Our steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine's fight for its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity will never waver. We are taking additional steps today to support Ukrainians in their pursuit of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace that will uphold all the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations (UN), including respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.
We are determined to support an independent, democratic Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. We continue to support Ukraine in further developing President Zelenskyy's Peace Formula. As stated in the Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine on July 12, 2023, we are formalizing our enduring support to Ukraine through specific, bilateral, long-term security commitments and arrangements.
Our commitment remains to restrict exports of all items critical to Russia's military and industrial base, including those used on the battlefield and we call on third parties to take equivalent action. We repeat our call for third parties to immediately cease providing material support to Russia's aggression, or face severe cost. We will work to further curtail Russia's use of the international financial system to further its war in Ukraine, including Russia's efforts to use the international financial system to facilitate its expansion of its military industrial base. We will update our measures. We will step up our efforts against evasion and circumvention of our sanctions and export controls measures. We continue to take actions against third country actors who materially support Russia's war including by imposing additional measures on entities where appropriate in third countries. We are targeting Russian military procurement networks and those who help Russia acquire machine tools, equipment and key inputs.
We are limiting Russia's ability to fund its illegal war by taking steps to limit Russia's energy revenue and its future extractive capabilities. We have dramatically reduced our reliance on Russian energy and commodities. We are determined to accelerate work on this path so that Russia is no longer able to weaponize energy against us. We commit to tightening compliance and enforcement of the price cap policy on Russian oil, including by imposing sanctions on those engaged in deceptive practices and by updating our compliance rules and regulations as necessary. We will also continue efforts to curtail Russia's revenue from other relevant sectors. We will also continue efforts to reduce Russia's revenue from metals. We will introduce import restrictions on non-industrial diamonds, mined, processed, or produced in Russia, by January 1, 2024, followed by further phased restrictions on the import of Russian diamonds processed in third countries targeting March 1, 2024. To further the effectiveness of these measures, those G7 members who are major importers of rough diamonds will establish a robust traceability-based verification and certification mechanism for rough diamonds within the G7 by September 1, 2024, and we will continue to consult with partners, including producing and manufacturing countries on its design and implementation.
We will continue consultations among G7 members and with other partners including producing countries as well as manufacturing countries for comprehensive controls for diamonds produced and processed in third countries on measures for traceability.
As Russia seeks to use winter as a weapon against the Ukrainian people, we are increasing our efforts to provide humanitarian aid and critical energy assistance. We strongly condemn Russian attacks against critical and civil infrastructure across Ukraine. We are supporting Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction, including through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine, and working to encourage further involvement of our private sector. We look forward to successful completion of the upcoming review of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program for Ukraine and support Ukraine's continued reform agenda including the efforts for its European path. Decisive progress is needed to direct extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from Russia's immobilized sovereign assets to support Ukraine, consistent with applicable contractual obligations and in accordance with applicable laws. We reaffirm that consistent with our respective legal systems, Russia's sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage it caused to Ukraine.
It is not right for Russia to decide if or when it will pay for the damage it has caused in Ukraine. Russia's obligations under international law are clear: Russia must both end its illegal war of aggression and pay for the damage it has caused, which according to the World Bank to date, already exceeds $400 billion dollars. In light of the urgency of disrupting Russia's attempts to destroy the Ukrainian economy and failure to abide by its international law obligations, we will explore all possible avenues to aid Ukraine in obtaining compensation from Russia, consistent with our respective legal systems and international law. We direct our relevant ministers to continue working on this issue towards our next meeting.
We reiterate our commitment to holding those responsible to account consistent with international law, including by supporting the efforts of international mechanisms, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine (ICPA) at Eurojust and welcome ongoing discussions in the Core Group exploring the establishment of a tribunal for the prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine.
Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, its posture of strategic intimidation and its undermining of arms control regimes are unacceptable. Threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its war of aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible. We deeply regret Russia's decision to withdraw its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We strongly support the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) continued presence and call for unfettered access to all of Ukraine's nuclear sites.
We deplore Russia's systematic targeting of Ukrainian Black Sea ports, grain and grain infrastructure. We support all efforts, including those of the UN, to facilitate exports of Ukraine's grain and other agricultural products. We welcome the success of Ukraine's maritime corridor and the EU's Solidarity Lanes. The increasing levels of global food and nutrition insecurity are exacerbated by Russia's aggression against Ukraine.
Middle East 
We unequivocally condemn the horrific terror attacks across Israel by Hamas and others that began on October 7, 2023. We emphasize Israel's right to defend itself and its people against Hamas, in accordance with international law, as it seeks to prevent a recurrence of these traumatic events, which included murder, hostage-taking, sexual violence, and attacks on children. Hamas offers nothing but suffering to the Palestinian people, and it is an obstacle to a better future for them and for the region. We will continue to coordinate our efforts to isolate Hamas and ensure it cannot threaten Israel.
While welcoming the recent pause that allowed the release of hostages and vital humanitarian aid into Gaza, achieved by the leadership of the United States, Qatar, Egypt, and other countries in the region, we deeply regret that Hamas refused to release all of the female hostages and military operations have resumed. Hamas has shown that it still poses a security threat to Israel, as demonstrated by its continued rocket fire since October 7 and its public statements asserting that it will continue to attack Israel in the future. We urge the immediate release of all remaining hostages without preconditions. At the same time, more urgent action is needed to address the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and minimize civilian casualties. We support and encourage further humanitarian pauses to enable this.
We are also deeply concerned with the devastating impact on the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza. More effective action must also be taken to prevent the displacement of additional people and protect civilian infrastructure. Every effort must be made to ensure unhindered and continued humanitarian assistance for civilians, including food, water, medical care, fuel, and shelter, and access for humanitarian workers. The population is increasingly vulnerable, and with winter approaching, we must continue to increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza to meet fully the needs on the ground, including by opening additional crossings. We underscore the importance of conducting deconfliction, protecting civilians and compliance with international law, in particular international humanitarian law. Since October 7, 2023, we have announced more than $600 million for assistance to the Palestinian people, including through United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and other UN agencies as well as other humanitarian actors. We call on the international community to fully fund the UN's flash appeal and are contributing to that effort.
We condemn the rise in extremist settler violence committed against Palestinians, which undermines security and stability in the West Bank, and threatens prospects for a lasting peace. Those who have committed crimes must be held to account. Regional actors must cease de-stabilizing activities: in particular, we call on Iran to refrain from providing support for Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other non-state actors, and to use its influence with those groups to de-escalate regional tensions. We, along with partners in the region, are working intensively to prevent the conflict from escalating further and spreading more widely. Emphasizing the global importance of maritime security, we call on all parties not to threaten or interfere with lawful exercise of navigation rights and freedoms by all vessels, and condemn the four attacks on December 3 against three separate commercial vessels, connected to fourteen separate nations, operating in international waters in the southern Red Sea. We especially call on the Houthis to immediately cease attacks on civilians and threats to international shipping lanes and commercial vessels. There are reasons to believe that attacks by the Houthis are enabled by Iran. We express our deep concern with the rise of hateful speech and acts across the world since the beginning of the conflict, and categorically reject antisemitism and Islamophobia in any form.
Israelis and Palestinians have an equal right to live in safety, dignity, and peace. We are committed to working closely with partners to assist in building the conditions for sustainable long-term solutions for Gaza. We also need to see a return to a broader peace process. We remain committed to a Palestinian state as part of a two-state solution that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting, and secure peace.
Indo-Pacific and the Region 
We remain determined that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon and reiterate that Iran must cease its unabated escalation of its nuclear program, which has no credible civilian justification and brings it dangerously close to actual weapon-related activities. We call on Iran to fulfill its legal obligations and political commitments regarding nuclear non-proliferation with prompt action, including the full and unconditional cooperation with the IAEA.
Together with regional partners, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its Member States, South Asian countries as well as the Pacific Island countries, we will continue our endeavors towards a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive, prosperous, secure, and based on the rule of law, and that protects shared principles.
Reconfirming the G7 Hiroshima Leaders' Communique, we stand together as G7 partners on the following elements, which underpin our respective relations with China:
There is no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea, and we oppose China's militarization activities in the region. We emphasize the universal and unified character of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and reaffirm UNCLOS's important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the oceans and the seas. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on July 12, 2016, is a significant milestone, which is legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings, and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties.
We reiterate our call for the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of all North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. We urge all UN Member States to fully implement all relevant UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). We strongly condemn continued ballistic missile launches, the recent launch using ballistic missile technology conducted on November 21, 2023 and arms transfers from North Korea to Russia, which directly violate relevant UNSCRs. We urge North Korea to respect human rights, facilitate access for international humanitarian organizations, and resolve the abductions issue immediately.
We welcome Japan's safe, transparent, and science-based process, including the continued monitoring of the situation, to responsibly manage the discharge of Advanced Liquid Processing System treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the sea in proactively coordinating with scientists and partners, particularly across the Indo-Pacific region, as well as with the IAEA. We also welcome the IAEA's comprehensive report of July 4, 2023 as well as its continued monitoring. We acknowledge the importance of the IAEA's onsite presence during the process.
We support Indonesia initiating the accession process to become a full member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as well as further progress on ongoing accession processes more broadly.
Supporting Developing Economies and Strengthening International Financial Institutions 
We reiterate our steadfast commitment to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We remain committed to partnering with developing countries, particularly low-income countries, in dealing with multiple and complex challenges, and in mobilizing finance for development from all sources. We reaffirm our commitment to mobilizing up to $600 billion by 2027 through the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) by scaling up public and private financing and investments through tailored country approaches and by developing key economic corridors.
We are working to deliver better, bigger, and more effective multilateral development banks (MDBs) by enhancing operating models, improving responsiveness and accessibility, and substantially increasing financing capacity to maximize development impact as well as by making MDBs work better as a system. We urge MDBs to continue their steadfast efforts to further implement the G20 Capital Adequacy Framework (CAF) recommendations. We urge the WBG to continue to implement operational and financial reforms. We will deliver on the G20 Leaders' commitment to collectively mobilizing more lending headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank's capacity to support low and middle-income countries that need help in addressing global challenges, with a clear framework for the allocation of scarce concessional resources, and to provide strong support for the poorest countries. The G7 has already announced planned contributions that will unlock more than $35 billion and will step up efforts to deliver substantial contributions to this end. We are committed to collectively securing an ambitious International Development Association (IDA) 21 replenishment next year. We will work together over the next year to encourage and support the MDBs in strengthening their efforts to mobilize private capital and domestic resources.
At the IMF, we support the work to ensure the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) is on a sustainable footing to meet the growing needs of low-income countries. We welcome the approval by the IMF Executive Board on a proposal to the Board of Governors to conclude the 16th General Review of Quotas of the IMF with a quota increase by December 15, 2023. We welcome the achievement of the $100 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDR) channeling target and will further explore viable options for enabling the voluntary channeling of SDRs through MDBs while respecting national legal frameworks and the need to preserve the reserve asset character and status of SDRs.
We will work together and with partners to deliver further progress on this global agenda, including through the IMF, MDB boards and the G20, as well as the discussions following the Paris Pact for People and the Planet and the G20 Compact with Africa Conference in Berlin.
We will continue to provide developing countries support for strengthening their tax capacity to build sustainable tax revenue sources to help deliver the SDGs. We also emphasize the role this support can play in implementation of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Two-Pillar Solution.
We reiterate the urgency of addressing debt vulnerabilities in low- and middle-income countries. This includes finalizing outstanding country cases, making future debt treatment more transparent and timely, and improving our toolkits to put countries tackling reforms on more sustainable footing before they fall into crisis. We welcome the finalization of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the debt treatment for Zambia and call for swift agreement on debt treatment for Ghana and Ethiopia. Following the recent agreement between Sri Lanka and its official creditors, we look forward to the swift resolution of the debt treatment of Sri Lanka. We welcome joint efforts by all stakeholders, including private creditors, to continue working towards enhancing debt transparency. We recognize the role that climate resilient debt clauses (CRDC) can play in enhancing the safety net for borrowers facing the impact of climate change.
Climate Change, Energy and Environment 
We remain steadfast in our commitment to the Paris Agreement, keeping a limit of 1.5°C global temperature rise within reach through scaled up action in this critical decade. We welcome the first global stocktake (GST), and will pursue ambitious outcomes at the ongoing 28th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC-COP 28) in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and extend our full support to the UAE Presidency. We welcome the swift adoption of the decision on operationalization of the new funding arrangements.
While acknowledging various pathways according to each country's energy situation, industrial and social structures and geographical conditions, we reiterate that these should lead to our common goal of net zero by 2050 at the latest in order to keep a limit of 1.5°C within reach. We will contribute towards and support a global tripling of renewable energy capacity and a doubling of annual energy efficiency improvements by 2030 taking into consideration national circumstances, with currently 123 countries supporting those targets at COP 28. We will do this hand in hand with accelerating the phase out of unabated fossil fuels so as to achieve our climate ambition. We commit to prioritizing concrete and timely steps towards the goal of accelerating the phase out of domestic unabated coal power generation, and to ending the construction of new unabated coal fired power generation. Those G7 countries that opt to use nuclear energy recognize its potential to provide affordable low carbon energy that can reduce dependence on fossil fuels, to address climate crisis, and to ensure global energy security as the source of baseload energy and grid flexibility, and support a global aspirational goal of tripling nuclear energy capacity from 2020 by 2050 that was endorsed by a coalition of 23 countries in the margins of the COP28, recognizing the different domestic circumstances of each country.
We continue our implementation of our commitments to the developed country Parties' goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually in climate finance by 2020 through to 2025, and welcome that the goal looks likely to have been met as of 2022 as stated in the Report by the OECD Secretary-General. We underscore the need to enhance international cooperation and coordination within the G7 and beyond. In this regard, recalling our determination to support developing countries' just energy transitions, we welcome progress achieved on Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) with partner countries and will continue our efforts for its implementation.
We reiterate our commitment to the swift and full implementation of the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and to achievement of each of its goals and targets. We are committed to ending plastic pollution, with the ambition to reduce additional plastic pollution to zero by 2040 including through an international legally binding instrument.
Economic Resilience and Economic Security 
Recalling the G7 Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security and recognizing that the weaponization of economic vulnerabilities is becoming a growing concern for G7 members and other countries, we are determined to continue making progress to enhance our strategic coordination on these issues, including through the G7's Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion. We will increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence, and response to economic coercion, and further promote cooperation with partners beyond the G7. We will also coordinate, as appropriate, to support targeted states, economies and entities as a demonstration of solidarity and resolve to uphold the rule of law.
We have strengthened channels of communication to address supply disruptions and shared insights and best practices, including from respective scenario-based stress testing. We will further step up our collaboration based on the principles on resilient and reliable supply chains, including for critical minerals, semiconductors and batteries, which are now supported by a broader number of partners beyond the G7. We encourage all countries to support them. We welcome the successful launch of the ""Partnership for RISE (Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement)"" and continue to support its implementation with speed and quality.
We affirm our shared responsibility and determination to coordinate on preventing the cutting-edge technologies we develop from being used to further military capabilities that threaten international peace and security. To this end, we will share, as appropriate, information and experiences to further develop common understanding of such risks and the policy tools needed to address them, and take further actions where necessary, including those related to export and investment, corresponding to the circumstances of each country. We will further strengthen multilateral efforts to cooperate in the field of export controls to ensure gaps in our dual use technology protection ecosystem cannot be exploited. We have a common interest in preventing the narrow set of technological advances that are assessed to be core to enhancing the military and intelligence capabilities of actors who may use these capabilities to undermine international peace and security, from being fueled by our companies' capital, expertise, and knowledge. We recognize that appropriate measures designed to address risks from outbound investment could be important to complement existing tools of targeted controls on exports and inbound investments, which work together to protect our sensitive technologies from being used in ways that threaten international peace and security.
We will increase our efforts to implement risk-based policies and measures to promote research security and research integrity.
We reiterate our commitment to working and coordinating on economic resilience and economic security through the G7 framework to make year-on-year progress in a holistic manner.
Trade 
We underscore the need to pursue WTO reform to improve all its functions through an inclusive member driven process, and remain committed to conducting discussions with a view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all members by 2024. We will continue to work towards concrete and ambitious outcomes at the upcoming 13th WTO Ministerial Conference.
Food Security 
We welcome progress on coordinated actions of the G7 with a wide range of stakeholders to strengthen global food security and nutrition. We recognize the continuing urgency and renew our commitment to working together with partners beyond the G7 to build resilient and sustainable agriculture and food systems and to progressively realize the right to adequate food and nutrition for all, in particular by ensuring open and fair agricultural trade, promoting resilient food supply chains and improving agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner. We also stress the need to improve availability, affordability and accessibility and promote efficient and responsible use of fertilizers, including through local fertilizer production.
We renew our commitment to developing and strengthening the global health architecture (GHA) for future health emergencies, achieving more resilient, equitable, and sustainable universal health coverage (UHC), and promoting health innovations.
We reaffirm our commitment to enhancing governance, international norms and regulations including through the negotiations on the future international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response (PPR) (WHO CA+). We also commit to financing for PPR, including through the Pandemic Fund, enhanced manufacturing capacity globally, and the exploration of a rapid response financing framework.
We also continue to call for further domestic resource mobilization, as well as efficient use of existing resources, and private financing, including through ""Impact Investment Initiative (the Triple I) for Global Health.""
Building on the G7 Hiroshima Vision for Equitable Access to medical countermeasures (MCMs), we welcome the collaborative progress made on the MCM Delivery Partnership for equitable access (MCDP) and also commit to explore further means to coordinate and mobilize surge financing for production, procurement, and delivery of MCMs, including development financing solutions.
We will further promote comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).
Digital 
We renew our commitment to advancing international discussions on inclusive artificial intelligence (AI) governance and interoperability between AI governance frameworks, while we recognize that approaches and policy instruments to achieve the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI may vary across G7 members, to achieve our common vision and goal of safe, secure, and trustworthy AI, in line with our shared democratic values. We endorse the outcomes of the G7 Digital and Tech Ministers' Meeting on December 1, 2023, notably the Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework and the Work Plan to advance Hiroshima AI Process. We welcome the Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework. It represents the first successful international framework that includes guiding principles and the code of conduct to address the impact of advanced AI systems on our societies and economies. We call on AI actors to support the Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles and the Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct. The achievement of the Hiroshima AI Process under Japan's G7 Presidency shows that we can act quickly to lead the way in responsible innovation and in the governance of emerging technologies. We look forward to further advancing the Hiroshima AI Process in accordance with the work plan developed by relevant Ministers.
We welcome the UK hosted AI Safety Summit and look forward to the next international AI meetings to be hosted by the Republic of Korea and France. We reaffirm the importance of our close cooperation with the OECD and the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI).
We commit to working together for further advancing the Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT), and welcome the concrete progress made in establishing the Institutional Arrangement for Partnership in cooperation with the OECD.
Conclusion 
As we look to the 2024 Italian G7 Presidency, and in our support to the Brazilian G20 Presidency, we will strive towards a peaceful and prosperous world, building on the outcomes achieved in Hiroshima.
Under the Italian Presidency, we will continue our support to Ukraine and will address other crises. We will promote mutually beneficial partnerships with developing and emerging countries, particularly in Africa. We will address key issues, such as economic security and resilience, sustainable development, food and energy security, gender equality, AI, irregular migration, and human trafficking.""

"Dec 11, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-hanukkah-reception-10,Remarks at a Hanukkah Reception,"""Well, Rabbi, thank you. And thank you for your blessings.

You know, thank you, Doug and the staff, for lighting this special White House menorah. As Doug said, that was from a piece of material from one of the beams in the White House. And I thought it's about time we had a permanent menorah here in the White House.

And to all of you, this means so much to Jill and me and to Doug and Kamala that you're here.

You know, I also want to thank—special thanks to my buddy right—standing right here in the front: Chuck Schumer. Chuck is our leader in the Senate. He's a great leader and recently delivered a powerful and historic speech—and I mean it, powerful and historic—combating anti-Semitism. I encourage everyone to read it. Everyone in America should read it.

Chuck, thank you, pal. You're always standing up.

The Talmud says, ""What comes from the heart, goes to the heart."" That's the warmth and kinship I feel so deeply with the Jewish community.

I got in trouble—got criticized very badly by the southern part of my State and some of the southern parts of the country when, 35 years ago, I said, ""You don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist, and I'm a Zionist."" [Laughter] And by the way, you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist.

Hanukkah is a timeless story of miracles. Think about it. You know, from the Maccabees defeating one of the—history's most powerful empires, on oil lasting 8 days was a miracle all by itself. The flame of faith that endures from tragedy to persecution to survival and to hope; that's what it survives to: survival and hope.

But we know this year's Hanukkah is different.

It's been 65 years [days; White House correction] since the deadliest day of the Jewish people since the Holocaust—65 years [days; White House correction]. Most of you—and I met—I got to meet with five [Holocaust; White House correction] survivors downstairs—that's why we're a little bit late—five survivors in each of the camps.

I've taken all my children when they turn 14 years of age. My three children who lived and my five grandchildren, when they're 14 years old, I put them on a plane, I take them to Dachau, because I want them to see. I want them to spend the day there and see.

You can't pretend you don't know. Silence is complicity.

Most of you know someone directly or indirectly—a family, a friend—that was stolen from you or wounded, traumatized, or called up in the reserves in this last attack in Israel.

As I said after the attack, my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist is independent—as an independent Jewish state is unshakeable.

Folks, were there no Israel, there wouldn't be a Jew in the world who was safe—were there no Israel. [Applause] It's the ultimate guarantee.

And I make no bones about it. I've had my differences with some Israeli leadership. I've known Bibi for now 51 years. He has a picture on his desk of he and I when he was a young member of the Israeli service here—foreign service, and I was a 32-year-old Senator. And I wrote on the top of it, ""Bibi, I love you, but I don't agree with a damn thing you have to say."" [Laughter]

It's about the same today. I love him, and—[laughter].

But look, it's a tough spot. It's a tough spot. We continue to provide military assistance to Israel until they get rid of Hamas.

But we have to be careful. They have to be careful. The whole world's public opinion can shift overnight. We can't let that happen.

We're working relentlessly for the safe return of the hostages. I've personally spent—[applause]—I've personally spent countless hours—and I mean it; probably up to 20 hours—with the Qataris and the Egyptians, the Israelis to secure the freedom of hostages, to get the trucks in, to get the humanitarian aid flowing, to convince them to open the gate, to get—have Elsisi make sure he opened the gate into Egypt.

And there's a whole range of things going on now that are really very, very difficult, very—but we've gotten more than a hundred hostages out, and we're not going to stop until we get every one of them home.

We will continue to lead the world in humanitarian assistance to innocent Palestinian civilians to emphasize to our friends—[applause]—to our Israeli friends we need to protect civilian life.

And let me be clear: Hamas using rape, sexual violence, and terrorism and torture of Israeli women and girls is appalling and unforgiveable. And we should—and I was there, saw some of the photographs, and it's beyond—it's just beyond comprehension. We all have to condemn such brutality without equivocation, without exception.

I also recognize your hurt from the silence and the fear and for your safety, because the surge of anti-Semitism in the United States of America and around the world is sickening. You know, we see it across our communities in schools and colleges and social media. They surface painful scars from millennia to hate—of hate, to genocide of the Jewish people.

My dad was a righteous Christian, for real. My dad, when he'd come home from work—he was a well-read man, never had a chance to go to college. And he'd come home before he closed down the business—he didn't own, but he managed—to go back and close it. And the kitchen table was where the—the dinner table is where we had conversation and incidentally ate.

My dad taught us about the horror of the Shoah. He talked about why we didn't let the ship in, why we didn't bomb the railroad tracks, and on and on and on. As I said, it awakened in me and my brothers and sisters and our children a sense—and our grandchildren—that this can happen again.

Silence is complicity. Silence is complicity.

As I said, that's why I've taken all of my children and grandchildren to Dachau and I—one to Auschwitz.

Look, folks, we just met with Holocaust survivors downstairs, including the widow of a dear friend—of the late Elie Wiesel, who taught us about the perils of indifference.

I think that they experienced only to—what they experienced, only to see what's happening today.

It's been clear that our administration stands with them arm in arm in arm. We're not going to walk away. We're aggressively—[applause]—we're aggressing—we're addressing and implementing the first-ever national strategy to combat anti-Semitism, prosecuting hate crimes—[applause]—prosecuting hate crimes, addressing anti-Semitism in schools, increasing security around Jewish centers of life, and more.

We're calling upon all Americans to make clear there is no place for hate in America against Jews and Muslims or anybody else.

I especially want to thank Deborah Lipstadt, the Holocaust expert and the first American Ambassador-level Special Envoy To Monitor and Combat Antisemitism around the world. It matters.

You know, in this moment, we must hold to the core values that make us Americans: equality, justice, freedom, dignity, respect—values that, from the inception of our Nation, have shaped the culture, the contributions, and the values of Jewish Americans, including all of you, including nearly 300,000 Jews who peacefully rallied on the National Mall last month with enormous pride, unity—[applause]—pride, unity, even joy in the face of extraordinary pain.

You embody what the late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks said: A people whose capacity for joy cannot be destroyed itself is [is itself indestructible; White House correction]—cannot destroy itself. It's indestructible.

Let me close with this. You know, after October 7, my father—a father returned to his kibbutz to salvage what he could from his home and what was left in the rubble and ruin. The home which hid—which he hid in with his wife and his daughter for 20 hours before being rescued, a home in the same neighborhood where his beloved son was brutally murdered.

But like the ancient Hanukkah story, buried [in; White House correction] piles of shattered glass, burned debris, and bullet-riddled walls, he pulled something from the ashes fully intact: a menorah. That's now on display in the foyer of this White House, your house, just outside this room.

He gave it to the President of Israel, who lent it to the Ambassador, Jack Lew, a symbol—a symbol of the Jewish people that not only survive, but heal, rebuild, and continue to shine their light on the world.

A reminder to hold on to the miracle of hope and faith, because when we do, no night is so dark we can't find light. No night is so dark we can't find night [light; White House correction].

No one knows that better than the Jewish people.

So, ladies and gentlemen, happy Hanukkah. And God bless you all.""	Remarks at a Hanukkah Reception"
"Dec 12, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-reception-2,Remarks at a Campaign Reception,"""Rosy, thank you very much.

Please. Please. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Please.

Thank you all so very much. Many of you have been my personal friends and political friends for a long time. I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long while. [Laughter]

And I want to thank you all—all of you—for your steadfast support. And, Rosy, particularly, thank you for that introduction and all the work you did to make this successful.

And most of all—in light of the introduction, it seems a little out of place—but Happy Hanukkah. [Laughter] Happy Hanukkah.

We know that this year's Hanukkah is different after October the 7th attack. As I said after the attack, the safety of the Jewish people, the literal security of Israel as an independent Jewish state is literally at stake. But it is unshakeable, our commitment to Israel.

We continue to provide military assistance to Israel as it goes after Hamas. And I've personally spent hours—hours, without exaggeration—talking to the Qataris, the Egyptians, the Israelis to secure the freedom of more than 100 hostages. And we're not going to stop until we—every hostage is returned home—[applause]—every one.

We'll continue leading the world in delivering humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian civilians as well to emphasize to our friends in Israel the need to protect civilian life. And they understand it, the vast majority of the population.

But most of all, we condemn Hamas's using rape, sexual violence, terrorism, and torture of Israeli women and girls without equivocation, without exception.

You know, they—I saw some of the photographs when I was there—tying a mother and her daughter together on a rope and then pouring kerosene on them and then burning them, beheading infants, doing things that are just inhuman—totally, completely inhuman.

I also recognize your hurt from the silence and the fear of the safety—your safety because of the surge of anti-Semitism here in America and around the world.

As I've said before, and I won't belabor it, but it's—people say, why have I had this feeling for so long, since I ran for the United States Senate 170 years ago? [Laughter]

My dad really was a righteous Christian. He taught me about the horrors of the Shoah. He'd —we—and he's—as a consequence, I've taken my grandchildren—my—my three children and my grandchildren, when they turned age 14, put them on a plane and flew them to Dachau because I wanted them to see, wanted them to spend the day there and understand that silence is complicity.

Yesterday, at the Hanukkah reception at the White House, I met Holocaust survivors, including a widow of our dear friend, the late Elie Wiesel, who taught us about the perils of indifference.

I've been clear that our administration stands with you. We're aggressively implementing America's first-ever National Strategy To Counter Anti-Semitism: prosecuting hate crimes, addressing anti-Semitism in schools, increasing security around Jewish centers of Jewish life, and more.

In this moment, we have to hold on to the core values of who we are as Americans. The core values are equity, equality, justice, freedom, dignity, respect—values that, from the inception of our Nation, have shaped literally the culture, contributions, and values of the Jewish Americans—including all of you that are here—Americans.

And that's what I want to talk about today.

You know, in 2020, you're the reason why we got 81 million votes, more than any Presidential candidate has gotten in American history. You're the reason—[applause]—you're the reason why Donald Trump is not a former President, but a defeated former President.

You're the reason why we're going to win in 2024 again, with your help, and we are. When we started, the pandemic was raging, the economy was reeling. Because of you—of you, look at what we've achieved: record job creation, historic economic growth, among the lowest inflation rates of any major economy on Earth. We've rebuilt our alliances around the world.

And because of the great help of Dick Durbin of Illinois, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we've reconfirmed 61 judges—and more, the first Black appointed judge to the Supreme Court of the United States, a woman. And combined, we've appointed more Black women to the appellate courts of the United States and—than every other President in history combined.

Trump and the MAGA Republicans want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. For the 51st time, they're trying—[laughter]—literally. We made it more affordable. We made it stronger. We made the biggest investment in our history in the world—history of the world to combat climate change. We signed the first new gun safety law in 30 years.

Despite actions of the Supreme Court and MAGA Republicans, we've relieved student debt for 3.6 million Americans, who now have a chance to buy their first home and pay their debts and get out of debt.

We're making a historic commitment to rebuild American roads, bridges, ports, airports, clean water systems, high-speed internet.

But for all we've done, the real heroes of the story are the American people. In thousands of towns all across America, we see the stories of revival and renewal; hope and optimism; pride—and pride in your work, pride in your family, pride in your town, pride in this Nation.

We know there's more to do, from childcare to eldercare, making sure the corporations pay their fair share. And we know that all the progress is at stake in this next election.

And by the way, we did all that, and we still reduced the deficit by $7 billion.

But what's most at stake in this next election is the future of American democracy, in my view. And that makes this all—it all possible.

Let me be clear, Donald Trump poses, in my view, many threats to this country, from the right to choose—you just saw what the Supreme Court of Texas just did—to civil rights and voting rights to the American standing in the world.

The greatest threat he poses, though, is to our democracy. Because if we lose that, we lose everything. When I first ran for President, I said democracy was at stake in America. A lot of people thought when I made that speech at Independence Hall in 2020—2021, that I—that they—that they thought I was exaggerating. But they don't think that anymore.

Remember January 6, Trump siting in the private dining room off of my Oval—the Oval Office for hours, watching it all unfold as a mob attacked to Capitol and desecrated the Capitol. Capitol Police died. It threatened the life of his own Vice President because the Vice President refused to violate his constitutional oath.

The same mob went looking for Nancy Pelosi. Some up—spun up the same lies, inspired an assault on her—who attacked her husband Paul with a hammer months later, smacking him in the head with a hammer. It's despicable. And silence coming from him.

Trump became the first losing Presidential candidate in history who refused to accept the will of the American people. He didn't even show up at the Inauguration. I can't say I was disappointed, but he didn't show up. [Laughter] My guess is, he won't show up for the next Inauguration either.

But listen to his words today. He says he's running not to serve the American—the people of America, but to get ""revenge"" and ""retribution."" His words, not mine. ""Revenge"" and ""retribution.""

Just the other day, he said—he said he liked to be a ""dictator."" Going to be a dictator—only ""for 1 day.""

As we Catholics say——

[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.]

[Laughter] He called those who oppose him ""vermin,"" language that echoes that what was heard out in Germany in the thirties. He talked about, quote, ""The blood of our country is being poisoned."" Sound familiar? Same era. And he threatened the use of American military in the streets of America to go after political opponents.

He embraces political violence instead of rejecting it, and he can't let that happen—we can't let that happen.

Look, all of you here understand what freedom means. It means truth. It means to have the courage to hold a mirror up to our Nation and say: ""Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? Can we be better?""

Unlike Trump, we don't believe America is dark and negative—a dark and negative nation driven by anger, fear, and revenge.

When Trump was—spoke at his Inauguration, he talked about ""American carnage."" When I spoke at my Inauguration, I spoke about possibilities.

We believe we are a hopeful and optimistic nation driven by a simple proposition: that everybody deserves a fair shot.

We're the only nation in the world built on—not on ethnicity, religion, geography. We're the only country built on an idea—an idea all Americans—all of history—the idea that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator. We've never fully lived up it, but we've never walked away from it either.

Trump wants to—that's what Trump wants to do, but we're not going to walk away from it.

Look, let me say that—as all this relates to Israel—I spend a lot of time, probably 75 percent of my time, dealing with foreign leaders and traveling the world. There is a real concern around the world that America is losing its moral center. There's a real concern that with America—American principles continue to be the vanguard of who we are. I've spent more time with NATO pulling together and holding it together than I think anyone has.

When Dr. Kissinger—3 weeks before he died, we—he and I had our real differences when he was active Secretary of State and I was a Senator—but he called to tell me—he said—he asked me to call him, and I did. He said that—he wanted me to know two things. One, not since Napoleon has Europe not looked at Russia with a—with fear in its eyes about what Russia would do, until now. Well, guess what? They are fearful of what we may do.

But it takes me to my concluding point about Israel and about all freedoms around the world. Israel—it's an existential threat to Israel—its very existence. Israel has a tough decision to make. Bibi has got a tough decision to make. There's no question about the need to take on Hamas. There's no question about that. None. Zero. They have every right.

Bibi and I talk a lot. I've known him for 50 years. Some of you know he has a picture on his desk—at least when I'm there, he has it on it. [Laughter] Eight and a half by eleven, with a picture of—where I wrote, ""Bibi""—when we were both young men, he was at the Embassy here and I was a Senator. I said, ""Bibi, I love you, but I don't agree with a damn thing you have to say."" [Laughter] That remains to be the case. [Laughter]

He's a good friend, but I think he has to change and—with this government. This government in Israel is making it very difficult for him to move.

You know, Ben Gvir is not what you would call someone who—this is the most conservative government in Israel's history—the most conservative. I've known every, every, every single head of State in Israel since Golda Meir. And I've known them because I've spent time with them many times.

And this is a different group. Ben Gvir and company and the new folks, they don't want anything remotely approaching a two-state solution. They not only want to have retribution, which they should for what the Palestinian—Hamas did, but against all Palestinians. They don't want a two-state solution. They don't want—anything having to with the Palestinians.

Folks, the Palestinians have been not governed well at all. A lot has happened that's very negative.

But I spent an awful—an awful lot of time with the Arab countries. Everyone from Saudi—without going into too much detail because it would be inappropriate—from Saudi Arabia to a number of other states, they want to normalize relations.

At the G-20 meeting with all the 20 major nations in the world, I got a resolution passed that no one thought could happen, saying we're going to build a railroad from the middle of India all the way up to England and a pipeline across the Mediterranean to unite the countries. And the train is going to go—literally, not figuratively—from—from India into Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia into—to Jordan, Jordan to Israel, Israel, et cetera.

Because there—we have an opportunity to begin to unite the region—unite the region. And they still want to do it. But we have to make sure that—that Bibi understands that he's got to make some moves to strengthen PLA [PA; White House correction]—strengthen it, change it, move it. You cannot say there's no Palestinian state at all in the future. And that's going to be the hard part.

But in the meantime, we're not going to do a damn thing other than protect Israel in the process. Not a single thing.

But, folks, there's a lot to do—a lot to do. We're going to have to be—as strong supporters of Israel, we're going to have to be honest about what we're doing and what the goal is. The goal is Israel's security. And if Israel—Israel's—if there were no—many of you heard me say over the years: Were there not an Israel, we'd have to invent one—we'd have to invent one.

I believe, without Israel as a freestanding state, not a Jew in the world is safe—not a Jew in the world is safe. It's up to what happens at the moment.

And so we've got a lot of work to do, but we're not going to—in the meantime, none of it is going to walk away from providing Israel what they need to defend themselves and to finish the job against—against Hamas.

And, folks, look, if you think about it, one of the things that Bibi understands, I think, now—but I'm not sure Ben Gvir and his war cabinet do, who I've spoken to several times—is that Israel's security can rest on the United States, but right now it has more than the United States. It has the European Union, it has Europe, it has most of the world supporting it. But they're starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place.

It was pointed out to me—I'm being very blunt with you all—it was pointed out to me that—by Bibi—that: ""Well, you carpet-bombed Germany. You dropped the atom bomb. A lot of civilians died.""

I said: ""Yes, that's why all these institutions were set up after World War II to see to it that it didn't happen again—it didn't happen again. Don't make the same mistakes we made at 9/11. There was no reason why we had to be in a war in Afghanistan at 9/11. There was no reason why we had to do some of the things we did.""

So those of you who have family back in Israel, you saw what happened when Bibi tried to change the Supreme Court. Thousands of IDF soldiers said: ""We're out. We're not going to participate. We're not going to support the military."" That wasn't any outside influence. That came from within Israel.

So, folks, there's a lot to do—a whole lot to do.

First and foremost, do everything in our power to hold Hamas accountable—every single thing in our power. They're animals. They're animals. They exceeded anything that any other terrorist group has done of late that I—in memory.

But, secondly, we have to work toward bringing Israel together in a way that provides for the beginning of option—an option of a two-state solution, because absent that—[applause]—[inaudible]. It's probably more than you wanted to hear, but—[laughter].

Look, I do not believe and I will not believe, after all this Nation has been through—our Nation—from independence to the Civil War to world wars; after being blessed by leaders like Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Dr. King; after having stood as a beacon of freedom and equality for the entire world—I don't believe this Nation is going to turn to my predecessor.

Folks, if we do our job in 2024, we'll be saving what few generations can be able to say: We'll be saving American democracy in a way that is needed. And the rest of the world is looking.

Many of you—you're all very sophisticated people, and I'm not being solicitous. You travel the world. Have you met any foreign leader who suggests to you that they'd like to go back to where we were in the ""America only"" position again? Have you found one?

Madeleine Albright was right. We are the essential nation. Like it or not, we are—not Joe Biden, America is the essential nation. And they're looking for us to lead. And with your help, that's what we'll continue to do.

But nobody, nobody, nobody on God's green Earth can justify what Hamas did. They're a brutal, ugly, inhumane people, and they have to be eliminated.

Thank you all very much.""	Remarks at a Campaign Reception"
"Dec 12, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-0,The President's News Conference With President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine,"""President Biden. Please have a seat.
President Zelenskyy, it's an honor to welcome you back to the White House.
When President Putin launched his brutal total invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022 and Russian tanks rolled over the border toward Kyiv, there were those who thought Ukraine wouldn't survive for a month. So no one—no one—should forget that for you to be here today—again today, nearly 2 years later, and for Ukraine to be standing strong and free is an enormous victory already.
Putin has failed—failed—in his effort to subjugate Ukraine. The brave people of Ukraine have defied Putin's will at every turn, backed by the strong and unwavering support of the United States and our allies and partners of more than 50 nations—50 nations—in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. And Ukraine will emerge from this war proud, free, and firmly rooted in the West, unless we walk away.
The American people can be and should be incredibly proud of the part they played in supporting Ukraine's success. We'll continue to supply Ukraine with critical weapons and equipment as long as we can, including $200 million I just approved today in a critical needed equipment: additional air-defense interceptors, artillery, and ammunition.
But without supplemental funding, we're rapidly coming to an end of our ability to help Ukraine respond to the urgent operational demands that it has. Putin is banking on the United States failing to deliver for Ukraine. We must, we must, we must prove him wrong.
The United States and Congress must, as I asked last week in this—it's stunning that we've gotten to this point. You know, we need to fully appreciate—fully appreciate—how it's wrong—how this is being viewed around the world and being used by Russia.
Russian loyalists in Moscow celebrated when Republicans voted to block Ukraine's aid last week. The host of a Kremlin-run show literally said, and I quote: ""Well done, Republicans! That's good for us,"" end of quote. Let me say that again. This host of a Kremlin-run show said: ""Well done, Republicans! That's good for us."" That's a Russian speaking.
If you're being celebrated by Russian propagandists, it might be time to rethink what you're doing. History will judge harshly those who turn their back on freedom's cause.
Today, Ukraine's freedom is on the line. But if we don't stop Putin, it will endanger the freedom of everyone almost everywhere. Putin will keep going, and would-be aggressors everywhere will be emboldened to try to take what they can by force.
Mr. President, I'll not walk away from Ukraine, and neither will the American people. A clear bipartisan majority of people across the United States and in Congress support your country. They understand, as I do, that Ukraine's success and its ability to deter aggression in the future are vital to security for the world at large.
And I have repeatedly made clear, from our first day in office, we also need Ukraine to make changes to fix the broken immigration system here—we also need Congress to make the changes to fix the broken immigration system here at home.
My team is working with Senate Democrats and Republicans to try to find a bipartisan compromise both in terms of changes in policy and provide the resources we need to secure the border.
Compromise is how democracy works. And I am ready and offered compromise already. Holding Ukraine funding hostage in an attempt to force through an extreme Republican partisan agenda on the border is not how it works. We need real solutions.
I also asked Congress for funding for Israel to take on Hamas and confront multiple other threats backed by Iran in the wake of the October 7 assault.
National Security Adviser Sullivan will travel to the region this week and meet with the Israeli war cabinet, as I have met with, to emphasize our commitment to Israel as well as the need to protect civilian life and ensure more humanitarian assistance flows and reaches into Gaza for Palestinian civilians.
Secretary Austin will also travel to the region this week to step up the international efforts to protect the free flow of commerce through the Red Sea.
The entire world is watching what we do, so let's show them who we are. America stands for freedom today, tomorrow, and always. America stands against tyranny and against oppression, and America stands with the people of Ukraine.
Thank you again for being here today, Mr. President, and thank you for everything Ukraine is doing to hold the line for liberty in the world.
The floor is yours, Mr. President.
President Zelenskyy. Thank you very much, Mr. President, dear journalists.
I'm glad to be here and personally thank you and tell you how Ukraine values what we've achieved together defending life and freedom.
In Ukraine, we are fighting for our country and freedom and, also—in Europe, we say, ""for our freedom and yours."" And this motto resonates not only in our country, not only in our hearts, not only in Ukraine, but also in Poland and Baltic States, Moldova, and others. When freedom is strong in one country, it is strong everywhere. When it burns in one soul, it presents its merits to others.
Ukraines have twice—Ukrainians have twice led revolutions this century defending freedom. For nearly 2 years, we have been in a full-scale war, the biggest—the biggest—since World War II, fighting for freedom.
We stand firm. No matter what Putin tries, he hasn't won any victories. Thanks to Ukraine's success—success in defense—other European nations are safe from the Russian aggression, unlike in the past. Ukraine can now tackle the Russian dictatorship so our children and other nations won't have to shed their blood and sacrifice lives defending against Russian aggression.
We've already made significant progress. We've shown that our courage and partnership are stronger than any Russian hostility. And we have freed 50 percent of the territories Russia occupied after February 24. And we won the Black Sea and are reviving our economy.
Thanks to maritime exports, Ukraine's 5-percent economic growth this year proves our effective partnership. And we've shown no Russian missiles can overdo the powerful American Patriot systems. Thank you very much.
And even during war, we are reforming our country and strengthening our institutions. Today President Biden and I discussed how to increase our strengths for next year.
First, air defense and destroying Russian logistics on Ukraine's land. Mr. President, thank you very much for your supporting—supporting us and in these areas—like our victory in the Black Sea.
We aim to win the air battle, crushing Russian air dominance. This will intensify our ground advantages in 2024 with our control of the skies. Who controls the skies controls the war's duration.
And today I would like to thank, of course, for yet another significant defense package with our defenders value very much.
Second, yesterday I met with American defense company leaders. They advised us on how to make our defense industries work faster and more effectively. Thank you, President Biden, for this important initiative we started with you.
Together, Ukraine and America can strengthen democracy's arsenal. And this is vital for other free nations and the U.S., as it involves your companies, technologies, and technology advancement and job creation.
And it is important to note that two-thirds of Americans support for Ukraine remains and works in the United States.
Third, I informed Mr. President that Ukraine has fulfilled all the recommendations of the European Commission regarding the preparation for a decision to start negotiations on Ukraine's accession to the EU. And we constantly communicate with European leaders about our joint steps, sanctions, and political efforts to pressure Russia.
American leadership is crucial. It's keeping this unity together, a unity that serves the entire free world. And I thank America for new sanctions. And today we discussed Putin's further isolation and making him pay for his aggression.
It's very important that, by the end of this year, we can send very strong signal of our unity to the aggressor and the unity of Ukraine, America, Europe, the entire free world. Everything we talked about today will help us in the year 2024.
Today's discussions in the White House and in Congress, across both parties and both Chambers, with the Speaker were very productive. And I thank you for the bipartisan support.
As we approach Christmas, on behalf of all our Ukrainian families separated by war and all sons and daughters on the front, Ukraine's greatest wish is to near this war's victorious end. No one—no one but Putin—wants a prolonged war.
We dream of a Christmas in the peacetime, of course. And we are working to turn our battlefield success into peace. And we are heading there together with you and thanks, of course, to your support.
Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you, America.
Slava Ukraini.
President Biden. Thank you. Look, we're going to alternate asking questions. We're going to ask a total of—each ask two questions. And I will ask the first question—I will ask—I will recognize the first question asker. [Laughter.]
I'll ask you a question to you all too. [Laughter]
But, Danny Kemp [Agence France-Presse].
Ukraine's Military Operations Against Russia/U.S. Assistance to Ukraine
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. For President Biden, Ukraine's counteroffensive has stalled in recent months, Congress is blocking aid, and Vladimir Putin appears ready to just wait things out. So what is the strategy for the U.S. and Ukraine next year to try and turn this around? And if that fails, at what point do you say to Ukraine, as a friend, that it is perhaps time to start looking at peace talks?
And for President Zelenskyy, welcome back to Washington. Can I ask you: Did you hear what you wanted to hear from Congress and from President Biden? And—or are you, indeed, more worried than when you got here? Thank you very much.
President Biden. Well, let me answer the question first. Let's put this in perspective. Remember how far Ukraine has come. Russia has failed—failed thus far—in trying to erase Ukraine from the map and subsume it into Russia. Ukraine has taken back more than 50 percent of its territory seized since February of '22. And it's pushed back Russian—the Russian Navy so Ukraine can export grain and steel to the world through the Black Sea.
And thanks to the incredible courage of the Ukrainian people and the bipartisan support from our Congress—but it's not just American support. There are more than 50 countries—50 countries—helping Ukraine with military, economic, and humanitarian assistance. Fifty.
The burden sharing: The U.S. has put up $75 billion, and our allies and partners have put up $100 billion. And more than 90 percent of our security assistance to Ukraine is being spent in the United States to provide weapons for Ukraine and replenish our stockpiles and build our industrial base.
We need to ensure Putin continues to fail in Ukraine and Ukraine to succeed. And the best way for that—to do that is to pass the supplemental.
President Zelenskyy. Yes. Yes. Can I answer it in Ukrainian? Please.
[At this point, President Zelenskyy spoke in Ukrainian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Thank you. First of all, I would like to add to the words of Mr. President Biden about successes. I think that these were not easy successes. Nonetheless, they were quite serious. They were serious steps forward. Indeed, we gained victory on the sea. We've destroyed ships of the Russian Federation. We throw the remnants of their fleet to Russian territorial waters.
Yes, they have something in the Black Sea in the vicinity of our temporarily occupied Crimea, but we are going to proceed this activity.
Now, our guys destroyed 20,000 of Wagner mercenaries. These are serious terrorists who were amassing everywhere on African Continent, in Syria, in Ukraine. There were a lot of mass. And nucleus of this terroristic organization is not existing anymore.
Yes, we had a lot of problems, but nonetheless we were able to do this. Moreover, Russia were not able to seize any part of our territory—any village, any town. I am not talking about large cities. And we are going to proceed with this.
It is—goes without saying that we have objective; we have clear plan. But if you allow me, I am not able to tell you in public on the details of 2024 operations.
If I heard what I want, I've heard a lot. Surely, I told what I wanted to. I feel and experience the support from President Biden administration, from Senators. And we've been talking with the Speaker.
I got the signals; they were more than positive. But we know that we have to separate words and particular result. Therefore, we will count on particular result.
Thank you.
President Biden. Your turn to ask a question.
[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]
President Zelenskyy. Yes, sorry.
President Biden. I mean to recognize someone.
[President Zelenskyy called on a reporter in Ukrainian.]
Ukraine's Military Operations Against Russia 
Q. Thank you for my taking my question. Dmytro Anopchenko, Ukrainian Television, U.S. correspondent. Many Republican voices doubt the ability of Ukraine to win the war. Senator Vance recently even told that Ukraine need to cede some territories to stop fighting.
[The reporter spoke briefly in Ukrainian; no translation was provided. He resumed speaking in English as follows.]
To be very honest, have you even considered such a step to cede the territories to stop fighting?
And, Mr. Biden, could you please clarify the policy and—of your administration, the strategy of your administration on Ukraine? Is it about helping the country to defend itself or to win the war? Because it's obviously such a difference.
President Zelenskyy. I will begin. Okay.
[President Zelenskyy briefly addressed the reporter, and the reporter replied, in Ukrainian; no translation was provided. President Zelensky then spoke in Ukrainian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
So first question to me. So your question is if we are ready to give up our territories?
[The reporter spoke in Ukrainian; no translation was provided. President Zelenskyy's response was then translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Zelenskyy. The question is not only about our words or thoughts. The question is about for what we are ready and for what we are not. How Ukraine is able to give up its territories, that's insane, to be honest.
We are mentioning God very often. This is not about Christianity. We have our people there. We have our families there. We have children there. That's part of Ukrainian society, and we are talking about human being.
They are being under tortures, they are being raped, and they are being killed. And those voices which offers to give up our territories, they offers as well to give up our people. That's not a matter of territory. That a matter of lives of families, of children, of their histories.
I don't know whose idea it is. But I have question to these people: if they are ready to give up their children to terrorists. I think no.
President Biden. We want to see Ukraine win the war. And, as I've said before, winning means Ukraine is a sovereign, independent nation and—that can afford to defend itself today and deter further aggression. That's our objective.
Trevor [Trevor Hunnicutt], Reuters—with Reuters.
U.S. Assistance to Ukraine
Q. Thank you, sir. First, a question for both of you. Given the Republican skepticism of the Ukraine effort, do you worry that a second term for President Trump would be the end of an independent Ukraine? That's for both of you.
And then for you, President Biden: Just an update, if you could, on the situation in Gaza on the reports that Israel has begun flooding Hamas tunnels. And just the offensive in southern Gaza generally, how long do you think that operation should last? Thank you.
President Biden. Well, first of all, with regard to political support for Ukraine, there is a strong bipartisan political support for Ukraine. A small number of Republicans who don't want to support Ukraine, but they don't speak for the majority of even the Republicans, in my view.
We're in negotiations to get funding we need. Not to promise—not making promises, but hopeful we can get there. I think we can.
And you're right. The world is watching what we do, which would send a horrible message to an aggressor and allies if we walked away at this time. And it would hurt our national security.
Did you want me to answer the other question as well with regard to——
Q. Yes, please.
President Biden. Say it again.
Israel's Military Operations in Gaza/Hamas/Civilian Casualties in Gaza/Humanitarian Assistance to Gaza 
Q. Sorry. So the question was just if you could talk a little bit about the Gaza operation, Israel flooding Hamas tunnels, and if you've had conversations with Bibi Netanyahu about how long that operation should last.
President Biden. Well, I have had conversations with Bibi Netanyahu, and I want to make sure that we don't forget what we're doing here. We have to support Israel because they're an independent nation that's being—I mean, the brutality, the inhumanity, the way in which Hamas treated the Israelis and—I mean, raping and burning and beheading. I mean, it just—just beyond comparison—beyond comparison and—to anything else that I've seen since I've been here, and I've been around for a long time.
But I think that we have made it clear to the Israelis and they're aware that the independence—the safety of innocent Palestinians is still of great concern. And so the actions they're taking must be consistent with attempting to do everything possible to prevent innocent Palestinian civilians from being hurt, murdered, killed, lost, et cetera.
And look, it doesn't lessen their responsibility, going after Hamas, to innocent Palestinians and—and Hamas. Look, we've—we have a responsibility to protect citizens and ensure they have access to humanitarian assistance. That's why I've worked so hard with our Arab friends, as well as the Israelis, to get humanitarian assistance into Israel, literally getting up to 140 trucks loaded with gear, loaded with food, loaded with everything that is needed by the Palestinians, including fuel.
So, you know, Israel has stated its intent to fulfill these responsibilities. It's very difficult.
With regard to the flooding of the tunnels, I'm not at liberty—well, there is assertions being made that they're quite sure there are no hostages in any of these tunnels. But I don't know that for a fact. I do know that, though, every civilian death is an absolute tragedy.
And Israel has stated its intent, as I said, to match its words with a—its intent with word—with actions. That's why I was—that's what I was talking about today.
Question three. I guess I asked that—no, I just asked that.
Q. He hasn't answered.
President Biden. It's your turn.
President Zelenskyy. My turn.
Q. Let him answer.
President Biden. Your turn.
[President Zelenskyy spoke in Ukrainian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Zelenskyy. So, addressing your question very quickly, I've been talking a lot with representatives of both parties. Both Democrats and Republicans proved full-fledged support. And we will see. But before this, we have always been trusting in support of our strategic partner, the United States, and we will consider that it will continue in this way. And Ukraine will not remain alone against such a critical terrorist as the Russian Federation.
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Q. Thank you so much. My name is Yaroslav Dovgopol for News Agency Ukraine. Next summer, the United States will host an anniversary NATO summit in Washington, DC, which—which raises a lot of hope, especially for Ukraine. President Zelenskyy, what does the Ukrainian side expect from this summit? And do you hope to hear direct invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance?
And, President Biden, under what conditions is the United States ready to support the initiative of inviting Ukraine to be member of NATO? Thank you.
[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]
President Zelenskyy. Thank you for your question. I will answer very quickly on this very complicated question.
We are not allies—until now, we are not members—we are allies, but we are not members—members of NATO. So that's why I think I will pass this question to—[laughter]—our big friend, President Biden. [Laughter]
President Biden. Well, look, I'm very proud of how strong and unified NATO has become. And now it's even larger. I—Putin wanted the Finlandization of NATO when I met with him in Geneva right after I was elected. And he's gotten the NATO-ization of Finland instead.
And NATO will be in Ukraine's future. No question about that. But if we—as said we said in Vilnius, Ukraine will become a member of NATO when all allies agree and conditions are met. Right now we have to make sure they win the war.
And you know, we launched the joint declaration of support alongside President Zelenskyy and the G-7 leaders in Vilnius, outlining a long-term commitment to supporting Ukraine's defense needs.
We also hosted a defense industry conference last week here in DC to get that critical work done. So it's a step at a time.
Thank you all very, very much.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. This concludes the—thank you, everybody. Thank you, everyone. This concludes the press conference. Thanks, everybody. Thanks, everybody.""	The President's News Conference With President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine"

On Tuesday, I met with the President of Ukraine, who is leading his people in a battle for freedom against Russian aggression. He came to America to ask us for help. Yet Republicans in Congress won't act to help.

The people of Israel are in a battle against terrorists, and they are waiting for our help. Yet Republicans in Congress won't act to help.

We have to address the situation at our southern border, and I am determined to try to fix the problem. We need funding to strengthen border security, but Republicans in Congress won't act to help.

We need to continue our progress on the economy and make sure inflation keeps going down and job growth keeps going up. That means avoiding self-inflicted economic crises like a Government shutdown, which Republicans in Congress are driving us toward in just a few weeks because they won't act now to fund the Government and critical priorities to make life better for the American people.

There is a lot of work to be done. But after wasting weeks trying to find a new Speaker of the House and having to expel their own Members, Republicans in Congress are leaving for a month without doing anything to address these pressing challenges.

I wake up every day focused on the issues facing the American people, real issues that impact their lives and the strength and security of our country and the world. Unfortunately, House Republicans are not joining me. Instead of doing anything to help make Americans' lives better, they are focused on attacking me with lies. Instead of doing their job on the urgent work that needs to be done, they are choosing to waste time on this baseless political stunt that even Republicans in Congress admit is not supported by facts.

"Dec 14, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-efforts-reduce-prescription-drug-and-health-care-costs-and-exchange-with-reporters,"Remarks on Efforts To Reduce Prescription Drug and Health Care Costs and an Exchange With Reporters in Bethesda, Maryland","""The President. Well, thank you, David. And this has been a fight that I just started the other day when I was a 37-year-old Senator. [Laughter] This has been an ongoing fight not just on my part, but on the part of an awful lot of people.

David, thanks for sharing how we're making progress in lowering costs and—for lifesaving medicines.

You know, we're here at a pharmacy today at the National Institute of Health to talk about my administration's work to crack down on price gouging, to lower prescription drug costs, to put money back in the pockets of hard-working families, and to reduce Government spending on prescription drugs at the same time.

Usually, when you talk about Government doing something that's going to affect spending, you think it's going to be—we're going to help people and going to cost taxpayers more. But this lowers taxes as well as lowers costs for individuals.

Too many folks lay awake at night—and I know from experience—watching that—staring at the ceiling worrying what will happen if their spouse gets cancer or if their child gets sick or if something happens to one of them.

Do they have enough insurance? Can they afford the medical bills? Will they have to sell the house? Will they—I get up, and—you know, it's easy to understand it. And we all know somebody who's been through that experience.

This isn't just about health care. It's about your dignity. It's about security.

You know, I think some of the press was with me when I was in Northern Virginia and that very distinguished-looking woman stood up. And she looked like she was in her early forties, maybe a little older. And she said she had a problem, and the problem was she couldn't afford the insulin for her children who had diabetes—she had two of them—talking about having to cut it in half. So—and because the cost was as much as $800 a month for them, and their insurance couldn't cover it.

Think of all the people—all the people in this country that are going through something like that. It's about giving folks just a little more breathing room. That's what this is about.

For too long, Americans have paid more for prescription drugs than any advanced nation on Earth. You can have the exact same drug made by the exact same company in the United States, and you buy it in America for one price. You go to Toronto, Paris, Berlin, or any other major capital in the world, in fact, you'll find they're paying two to three times less than the American is paying at an American drugstore.

Folks, it's wrong.

The results? Seniors are skipping doses, cutting pills in half, foregoing prescriptions entirely because they simply can't afford their prescription drugs.

But not anymore. We finally, after all these years, beat Big Pharma when I signed the Inflation Reduction Act to get seniors and taxpayers a better deal.

For years, there's been no check on how high or how fast Big Pharma can raise drug prices. In the years before we passed this legislation, drugmakers jacked up prices nearly four times faster than inflation went up. And they were already too high.

Let's call this for what it is: It's simply—it's a rip-off. They're ripping off Medicare. They're ripping off the American people. And they're—we're going—but we're now back—fighting back.

As part of our law, which passed last year, drug companies can raise prices more than—if they raise prices more than inflation, they'll have to pay back the difference between inflation, as it's gone up, and the price they charge. And that means consumers will pay less as well.

They're going to save taxpayers money and discourage companies from raising prices in the first place.

Here's how it's going to work. On its face, it seems complicated, but it's really not that complicated.

Every quarter, Medicare publishes a list of drugs administered by doctors whose prices have been hiked too much, too fast. Today, Medicare is announcing its latest list: 48 prescription drug prices have raised—were raised faster than the rate of inflation was raised in the same period. These drugs are used by 750,000 Americans.

If a medication you take is on the list, our program is going to keep your cost down. For example, many seniors taking the drug Signifor, a growth hormone disorders—for growth hormone disorders, will save over $300 per month.

In the last year, 64 different drugs have been listed for these rebates. Some seniors have saved more than $600 a—per dose.

And that's not all. We're not only working to slow price hikes, we're also working to bring down drug prices, period—just bring them down.

For starters, my legislation finally gives Medicare the power to negotiate to lower drug prices like the Department of Veterans Affairs has been able to do for a long time.

Now Medicare is able to do that. We're fighting for—we've been fighting for decades—and I literally mean decades—to give Medicare that right.

With this law, we finally beat Big Pharma, and we got it done, I must admit, with no help from the other team at all. Not one single Republican voted for it.

In August, the first 10 drugs were selected for negotiation—drugs that treat things like arthritis, cancer, heart failure, and so much more.

In all, this law is going to save the Federal Government $160 billion over the next 10 years. Did you hear me? Because Medicare is going to pay less, it's going to save the Federal Government and taxpayers $160 billion over the next 10 years. And that money will go toward reducing the deficit and enriching—and not enriching Big Pharma.

It also reduces the cost of insulin for seniors from as much as $400 per month to just 40—or, excuse me, $35 per month. It makes important vaccines for seniors, like shingles, free, saving them $200 per shot.

And it's going to cap the total out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare now—next year, in '24, it's going to be capped at—no matter what your costs are, they're going to be capped at $3,500. But in 2025, it's going to go down to $2,000 per year no matter how expensive your drugs are. And drugs, as you heard from our—my introducer, can be up to 10-, 12-, 14,000 dollars a year for cancer drugs.

David just said that—that his cancer drug costs $16,000 a year. Thanks to this law, he's going to pay a hell of a lot less. It's a real game changer.

This law is going to lower costs, it'll save lives for people who forgo drugs because they can't afford them, and it'll give folks a little more—just—my dad used to say, ""just a little more breathing room."" Just a little more breathing room.

That's what Bidenomics is all about.

Folks, negotiating—negotiation and competition are the engines of a market economy. In every other industry, people negotiate prices every time. But with Big Pharma, it's been using to get its own way—no negotiation, suppressing competition instead of innovation.

Drug companies say they need that extra revenue to develop cutting-edge drugs. Well, but studies show Big Pharma lately has spent more on stock buybacks, executive pay, and research than—than on research. Meanwhile, American taxpayers are footing the bill—more of the bill.

Through their tax dollars, Americans pay more for Federal drug research here at the National Institute of Health and other programs than folks in any other country in the world pay for it. And we're happy to spend the money for the research, because they do such good work. I believe it's a good thing if it leads to breakthroughs that save lives.

But drug companies benefit considerably from that research. They could not make their own drugs without the research done here.

Taxpayers already are chipping in, making—paying a lot of money for—here at NIH—to get these brilliant scientists to go out and find cures, find answers to the drug problem—to drugs—afford—with the use of drugs for health problems.

And then they turn around and they charge Americans more because they—than anyone else in the world, because they—the private companies—take advantage of what happens here at this institute. I think it's outrageous.

I'm pleased to announce that, from now on, the part of the Federal Government that prepares for and responds to public health emergencies will make the call—so-called fair pricing a standard part of its contract negotiations with drugmakers. That means American families will finally pay the same as people in other countries for many of the vaccines and treatments developed or funded through their own tax dollars in the first place.

It's a simple principle. You shouldn't pay the highest price in the world for drugs that your tax dollars have already helped create.

We're already begun to secure fair-pricing clauses in contracts for new COVID vaccines—three new COVID vaccines. And we recently proposed that when a drug company prices drugs so high that Americans can't afford them and those drugs were created by the American tax dollars, the Federal Government can step in and allow other companies to make and sell that same drug for less because they did it here.

This is all part of my administration's work to promote competition across our economy, to lower costs, to raise wages, and improve care.

Last week, we announced new steps to crack down on anticompetitive practices in health care. And we're going after what we call ""junk fees,"" like junk health insurance plans that look affordable and then turn out to stick consumers with hidden costs they didn't know existed.

We cracked down on supposed—so-called surprise billing. For example, when a patient goes to a hospital for surgery, and it turns out the anesthesiologist—may be a wonderful man or woman—is out of their network—their insurance network—they get a surprise bill for thousands of dollars because it's not covered.

They didn't know they were going to get that bill. They should be aware of it. We're protecting millions of Americans every month from these unexpected medical bills.

We're taking steps to ban the use of medical debt in credit reporting. Think about this now. How many people have medical bills? If I added up the costs of when I was in the hospital, it's literally several hundred thousand dollars. Imagine had I gotten that and I didn't have insurance and I ended up in debt because of that.

Well, the credit reporting is so families and their credit reporting—those bills cannot be held against you forever by denying you credit, so they're not counted in your credit statement.

Folks, here's the deal. Americans don't like being played for suckers. But Republicans are okay with that. They're fighting to keep these junk fees. They're trying to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and they're very straightforward about it.

And not a single, solitary Republican voted for any of the legislation which is responsible for so much of these drug savings. But I know some want to.

Now they want to repeal the law and let Big Pharma charge whatever it wants for prescription drugs again. They want to send us back to the bad old days.

In short, Republicans want to raise costs for seniors and working families and allow exorbitant profits for Big Pharma. I will not let that happen as long as I'm around.

I'm a capitalist. I'm a capitalist. You should be able to make profit and significant amounts of money. I have no problem with companies making reasonable profits, though. But not on the backs of seniors and working people.

For too many folks, the cost of even just one drug can mean the difference between life and death, hope and fear.

This is all about fairness. It's about dignity.

As I was saying to the—these folks behind me when we were—before we came in, you know, imagine being that parent who has two children who have diabetes, need insulin, and you can't afford it for both of them. Imagine. Imagine the—you get stripped of your dignity. You look at your kids, and you can't afford it.

So, we're going to keep fighting to lower prescription drug costs not just for seniors, but for everyone; to expand health care coverage; to keep building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, where health care is a right, not a privilege, and patients come out before profits.

You know, I know we can do this. I really do. We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity if we work together.

And in this area, we're not only working to cut the costs for people needing the drugs, we're cutting the costs for the average taxpayer so they don't have to pay as much to fund Medicare, because Medicare is paying less as well.

This is a doubleheader. You save the taxpayer at large money because Medicare is not paying as much, and you save individual patients' lives as well as money.

So, I want to thank you all for taking the time to be here. I want to thank my introducer. I know you're down to 35, but it's going to get down to 2,000 bucks a year, max——

"Dec 19, 2023",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-reception-bethesda-maryland,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Bethesda, Maryland","""The President. Hello, hello, hello.
Thank you, Governor Wes Moore, for that introduction. I tell you, I was ready to hear another hour or so. [Laughter] Thank you very much. And I want to thank you for—the First Lady, Dawn, for putting up with you all these years. [Laughter]
Look, the fact is that, you know, you have—do have a great Lieutenant Governor. She is first rate.
And my good friend, Steny Hoyer, we've worked together a long, long time. Now, you were saying all those things about Maryland being first. I've been saying to Steny for years the Eastern Shore of Maryland is really the Western Shore of Delaware. [Laughter] But I'm glad he's taken such incredible, good care of us. Steny, you're the very best, man. You are the very best.
Risa and Ben, thank you for hosting. This is really important to me, and I can't tell you how much it means to me and your friendship as well.
But before I begin, I want to say a few words about the situation in the Middle East because I know a lot of you want to hear about it. And I'm going to be very brief because I'll have time to talk about it later.
But I went—when I went to Israel, I went to—to fight Hamas, to—they faced a burden, a few milestones that few countries have to face and militaries that—a military enemy that says it has one goal: to—the elimination—elimination, using terror, of the entire State of Israel. Hamas has no regard—none whatsoever—on whether—if those civilians live or die.
They faced additional burdens too. Hamas is holding a significant number of hostages, including American hostages.
But from the beginning—I've said from beginning, those added burdens do not lessen Israel's responsibility to distinguish between the Palestinian people and Hamas and to take care to minimize civilian deaths.
And we're take—and you know, we're talking to Israel and the Arab partners about political future for the Palestinian people and a two-state solution with Israel's security guaranteed, where Israel enjoys peace and normal relations with their Arab neighbors.
And we're—I've been in discussion—I think one of the reasons why Hamas moved when they did—as Steny knows, I was working very closely with the Saudis in the formal recognition of Israel.
But, ladies and gentlemen, let me get to the reason we're here tonight. I want to thank you. In 2020, you were the reason why we got 81 million votes, more votes than any Presidential candidate has ever gotten in American history. But they're also the reason why Donald Trump not only is a former President, but a former defeated President.
And you're the reason why we're going to win in 2024.
You know, when we started, the pandemic was raging, the economy was reeling. Because of you, look at what we've achieved: record job creation, historic economic growth, among the lowest inflation rates of any major economy on Earth. We rebuilt our alliances around the world.
And because of the great help of Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we continue to provide for a significant number of—over 60 now—Federal judges at a historic pace, two-thirds of the people—of whom are people of color. The most diverse slate ever, the first Black woman ever appointed to the United States Supreme Court, and more Black women in the Federal—Federal appellate courts and circuit courts than every other President in history combined.
Trump and the MAGA Republicans want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. In fact, they failed 50 times so far. They're going for 51. [Laughter] They're still not giving up. And it's going to—it's the very thing that allows people with preexisting conditions to have insurance. I won't go into all the detail. You know it.
On our watch, we made affordable care even stronger. We're in a position—we made the biggest investment in the history of the world to combat climate change. We signed the first new gun safety law in 30 years.
We need to do more. Despite actions from the Supreme Court and MAGA Republicans, I've relieved the student debt of 3.6 million Americans, and we're going to keep going.
I made a historic commitment to rebuild America. Here in Maryland, you've—we've already announced over $11 billion, including 140 specific projects, including fully replacing the Baltimore Tunnel. I'm probably the only person in here who's ever walked through that tunnel. [Laughter] Not a joke.
I traveled over one million two—three hundred and twenty thousand miles on Amtrak, commuted every single day for years. And that tunnel was built about 180 years ago. [Laughter]
The tunnel will be all electric. Trains will travel through at 110 miles an hour instead of 30 miles an hour now, and it's going to be a game changer across the board.
But for all we've done, the real heroes of this story are really the American people. In thousands of towns all across America, we see thousands of stories of revival and renewal, hope and optimism, and pride: pride in your work, your family, your town; pride in the Nation.
We know there's more to do for childcare and eldercare, making sure that the very big corporations—and by the way, I know something about big corporations. I come from Delaware. [Laughter] More corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other State in the Nation combined. I'm not anticorporation, but it's about time they start paying their fair share in taxes.
And by the way, even with the historic investments we've made, we still have reduced the deficit. All the talk about all we've done, we've reduced the deficit so far by $1 trillion—$1 trillion. In part because of increasing revenue, but the recovery is going so strongly that we now are able—relative to when I took office—are able to generate additional income.
We reached a bipartisan budget agreement, cut spending an additional $1 trillion over the next 10 years, and in my budget, we proposed more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction, on top of—mostly by asking the big corporations to begin to pay their fair share.
Look, and we all know that progress is at stake in the next election. But I want to talk about what I think is even more at stake in this next election: literally the future of American democracy. And it makes everything possible.
Let me be clear: Donald Trump poses many threats to the country, from the right to choose to civil rights to voting rights to America's standing in the world.
Some of you are—you're all successful people; you've traveled the world. Find me a head of state or someone of consequence in a country you visit that doesn't say—you will not—will not—will believe that every head of state I've met—come in contact with says: ""You've got to win. You've got to win.""
More—less about me, unfortunately, I think, than about the other guy. [Laughter]
But all—it's—the greatest threat Trump poses is to our democracy. Because if we lose, we lose everything.
When I first ran for President, I said democracy was at stake in America. I think a lot of people, particularly the press, thought I was exaggerating. But they don't think that anymore.
They saw what happened on January 6. Sitting in that little dining room off the Oval Office, Trump—Trump sitting there, watching it unfold on TV as a mob attacked the Capitol and desecrated the Capitol. A mob threatened the life of his own Vice President because the Vice President refused to violate his constitutional oath.
The same mob went looking for Nancy Pelosi, spun up by the same lies that inspired the assault that attacked her husband with a hammer to the head 2 months later.
This is a former President who actually condones and encourages violence against his fellow Americans. It's simply not acceptable in America to condone violence. It's despicable.
Trump became the first losing Presidential candidate in history who refused to accept the will of the American people, even though he lost 60 court challenges, recounts in Georgia and Wisconsin. In fact, Donald Trump is the only candidate in history to lose Georgia three times in the same election. [Laughter]
He didn't even show up for my Inauguration. Can't say I was disappointed. [Laughter] My guess, he won't show for the next one either. [Laughter]
But look, listen to his words today. Just this weekend, Trump was embracing his old pal, Putin. Trump even quoted him this weekend. It's no surprise. After all, there's a lot of agreement between Moscow and Mar-a-Lago.
Trump says he's running not to serve the people of America, but to—his quote—to get ""revenge"" and ""retribution."" Just recently, he said he'd be a dictator for only 1 day. In that 1 day, he's going to take out the Affordable Care Act—40 million people—he wants to get rid of it. He wants to fill the Government with Trump loyalists, seeking a loyalty oath; fire career officials.
He uses the power of the Federal Government for revenge and retribution against his enemies. And the language he uses reminds us of the language coming out of Germany in the thirties. He has called those who oppose him ""vermin."" And again, this weekend, he talked about ""the blood of our country"" is being poisoned. Even conservative Republicans have spoken out against it.
He's threatened to use the U.S. military in the streets of America to go after his political opponents. Once again, he embraces political violence instead of rejecting it. We can't let this happen. God knows where he'll take us.
Look, all of you here understand that freedom means to tell the truth, to have the courage to hold up the mirror to the American people and say: ""Is this who we are? Can we get better? How can we get better?""
Trump, we don't believe—he doesn't believe he—when he said—he talks about America being, quote, ""a failing nation,"" driven by anger, fear, and revenge. Then Trump spoke—at his Inaugural, he spoken to the American—he spoke about ""American carnage."" When I spoke at my Inauguration, I talked about America's possibilities.
I believe—I was with Xi Jinping on the Tibetan Plateau when I was Vice President, because I had to get to know him because Barack and I knew he was going to be President. It wasn't appropriate for the President to travel with him. So I've spent over 68 hours alone with him, just he and I with contemporaneous interpreters, and a total of 100—over 100 hours on Zoom with him, total.
And he asked me on the Tibetan Plateau—this is the God's truth—he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" I said, ""Yes, I can."" And I meant it. ""In one word: possibilities."" Possibilities.
We're the only nation in the world that believes anything is possible if we put our mind to it—anything. We believe we're a hopeful and we're an optimistic nation, driven by a simple proposition that everybody deserves a clear shot.
We're only—the only nation in the world built not on race, religion, ethnicity, geography. We're the only nation built on an idea, literally an idea. Not hyperbole. An idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and—you know the rest.
We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it. It's the idea that created America. And, ladies and gentlemen, we're not going to walk away now.
Let me close with this: In 3 years, we're going to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the signing—excuse me—of the Declaration of Independence. It will be a moment not only about our past, celebrating what we've done, but also about our future and all we can be.
I don't believe in—I don't believe and I will not believe that, after all this time, what we've done as a nation, we're going to be—walk away. From the—from the fight for independence to the Civil War to World Wars; after being blessed with leaders like Washington and Lincoln and Roosevelt and Dr. King; after having stood as a beacon of freedom, for equality in the world—for all the world, I don't believe our 250th anniversary is going to turn to Donald Trump.
Just this weekend, Trump said, and I quote, ""Our country is not a great country anymore."" ""Our country is not a great country anymore."" I simply don't believe that, and I don't think any of you do.
Folks, imagine that moment and ask, ""What do we want to be on the 250th anniversary?"" If we do our job in 2024, we'll be able to say something few generations get to say or have done: We'll actually be able to say we saved American democracy. Because the alternative is stark. It is stark.
I'm positive—absolutely positive—we can do it. You know, all the talk about polls and all the like—well, you know, there's an awful lot of polls. But the one that just came out talking about a summary of all the polling by Simon Rosenberg, we, on average, are up by 47, 45. It shouldn't even be that close—the New York Times/Siena poll.
Eight recent polls show us winning by 2 to 6 points. But that's not—that doesn't mean a lot right now, in my view, either way, in polls. Those of you who know the business, it's awful hard. You know, you've got to call—you've got to make about 20 calls to get 1 person to answer their cell phone. Seriously.
But I've never been more optimistic about America, about our country. I know that I was—when I had—I had an emergency operation years ago for a cranial aneurysm. And the doc—when they were wheeling me down, I said, ""What are my chances, Doc?"" And he gave me his estimate.
And I—he said, ""I'm not sure whether this is congenital or—a congenital problem or it's environmental."" And I said, ""I don't care what it is, Doc, just take care of it."" [Laughter]
And he looked at me and said, ""You know what your problem is, Senator?"" And I'll never forget this. He said, ""Your problem is, you're a congenital optimist."" [Laughter]
I am a congenital optimist about America. There's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. I really mean it.
Think about it. Name me another nation in the history of the world that has come out of every crisis stronger than we went in—stronger than we went in. That's who we are, because we're the American people.
We're the United States of America. We've got to remember that. There's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity.
I promise I'll do everything in my power not to let you down. I guarantee I'll work like the devil. And I guarantee you: We make our case, we win.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for taking the time.
Folks, I used to think that traffic was a problem before I was President—[laughter]—but they tell—the Secret Service tells them when to shut down the roads. For every vote you're helping me pick up, I'll lose three. [Laughter]
We told them we'd be doing this now. If I don't, they shut down the roads, and they may come for the tent.
So thank you again. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
And by the way, your Governor is one of the best in the Nation. [Inaudible]
Thanks for the help, man. Thank you all very much.""        Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Bethesda, Maryland"

Hey, everybody. Look, as you probably already know, today 10 Americans have been released from Venezuela prison. They're in an aircraft—can you hear me?
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. They're in an aircraft on their way home to the United States. And we've secured the release of every American being held in Venezuela—on their way home. And we have no higher priority than the release of detained and/or hostage—Americans being held hostage.
In addition to that, Venezuela thus far is keeping their commitment toward the democratic election. Not over yet, but they've made detailed commitments. We'll see if they hold them. But we're going to hold them accountable. And, matter of fact, one hostage being held—sent home is one who is going to be tried. But—and—what else did I want to say to you?
In total, Venezuela has released 20 political prisoners in Venezuela, on top of the 5. They're all Venezuelans that have been let out of jail. And they have a right to a democratic future.
That's all I wanted to confirm with you.

These individuals have lost far too much precious time with their loved ones, and their families have suffered every day in their absence. I am grateful that their ordeal is finally over, and that these families are being made whole once more.

Additionally, a fugitive named Leonard Francis, who fled the United States before he could be sentenced for his lead role in a brazen bribery and corruption case, was extradited from Venezuela so that he will face justice for crimes he committed against the U.S. Government and the American people.

We are ensuring that the Venezuelan regime meets its commitments. They have announced an electoral roadmap—agreed to by opposition parties—for competitive Presidential elections in 2024. This a positive and important step forward. And today they are releasing—20 political prisoners, on top of 5 released previously. We will continue to monitor this closely and take appropriate action if needed. We stand in support of democracy in Venezuela and the aspirations of the Venezuelan people.

As we welcome home our fellow citizens, I must also remind all Americans of the longstanding warning against traveling to Venezuela. Americans should not travel there.

Reuniting wrongfully detained Americans with their loved ones has been a priority for my administration since day one. As is the return to the United States of fugitives from justice.

But even as we celebrate the return of these Americans, we also remain deeply focused on securing the release of the hostages in Gaza and wrongfully detained Americans around the world, including Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, who are being detained in Russia, and Americans in Afghanistan, Syria, and China.

A Proclamation
1. In Proclamation 9834 of December 21, 2018, the President determined that the Islamic Republic of Mauritania (Mauritania) was not making continual progress in meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ""Trade Act""), as added by section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (the ""AGOA"") (title I of Public Law 106-200, 114 Stat. 251, 257-58), 19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1). Thus, pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)), the President terminated the designation of Mauritania as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act.

2. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act authorizes the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ""beneficiary sub-Saharan African country"" if the President determines that the country meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).

3. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act, based on actions the Government of Mauritania has taken, I have determined that Mauritania meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA and the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of the Trade Act, and I have decided to designate Mauritania as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.

4. Section 112(c) of the AGOA, as amended in section 6002(a)(3) of the Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (division D, title VI, Public Law 109-432, 120 Stat. 2922, 3190-93), 19 U.S.C. 3721(c), provides special rules for certain apparel articles imported from ""lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.""

5. I have also determined that Mauritania satisfies the criterion for treatment as a ""lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country"" under section 112(c) of the AGOA.

6. In Proclamation 7350 of October 2, 2000, the President initially designated the Central African Republic, the Gabonese Republic (Gabon), Republic of Niger (Niger), and the Republic of Uganda (Uganda) as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act.

7. Section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act provides that the President shall terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A if the President determines that the country is not meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act.

8. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act, I have determined that the Central African Republic, Gabon, Niger, and Uganda do not meet the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act. Accordingly, I have decided to terminate the designations of the Central African Republic, Gabon, Niger, and Uganda as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of section 506A of the Trade Act, effective January 1, 2024.

9. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel (USIFTA), which the Congress approved in section 3 of the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the ""USIFTA Implementation Act"") (Public Law 99-47, 99 Stat. 82 (19 U.S.C. 2112 note)). Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act provides that, whenever the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out the USIFTA. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (United States-Israel Agreement Concerning Certain Aspects of Trade in Agricultural Products (the ""2004 Agreement"")).

10. In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, the President determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act and consistent with the 2004 Agreement, that, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, it was necessary to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel. Each year from 2008 through 2022, the United States and Israel entered into agreements to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement was in force for 1-year periods to allow additional time for the two governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement. To carry out the extension agreements, the President in Proclamations 8334 of December 31, 2008; 8467 of December 23, 2009; 8618 of December 21, 2010; 8770 of December 29, 2011; 8921 of December 20, 2012; 9072 of December 23, 2013; 9223 of December 23, 2014; 9383 of December 21, 2015; 9555 of December 15, 2016; 9687 of December 22, 2017; 9834 of December 21, 2018; 9974 of December 26, 2019; 10128 of December 22, 2020; 10326 of December 23, 2021; and 10509 of December 23, 2022, modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to provide duty-free access into the United States for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, each time for an additional 1-year period. On November 13, 2023, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force for an additional 1-year period, through December 31, 2024, to allow for further negotiations on an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act, I have determined that it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States for an additional 1-year period, through the close of December 31, 2024, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, as provided in Annex I of this proclamation.

11. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions taken thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.

Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 111(a) of the AGOA, sections 506A(a)(1) and 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act, section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act, and section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended, do proclaim that:

(1) Mauritania is designated as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A of the Trade Act.

(2) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 16(a) to the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries ""Islamic Republic of Mauritania"".

(3) For purposes of section 112(c) of the AGOA, Mauritania is a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.

(4) In order to provide the tariff treatment intended under section 112(c) of the AGOA, note 2(d) to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in the list of lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries ""Islamic Republic of Mauritania;"".

(5) The designations of the Central African Republic, Gabon, Niger, and Uganda as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of section 506A of the Trade Act are terminated, effective January 1, 2024.

(6) In order to reflect in the HTS that beginning January 1, 2024, the Central African Republic, Gabon, Niger, and Uganda shall no longer be designated as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, general note 16(a) to the HTS is modified by deleting ""Central African Republic"", ""Gabonese Republic"", ""Republic of Niger"", and ""Republic of Uganda"" from the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. Note 7(a) to subchapter II and note 1 to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTS are each modified by deleting ""Uganda"" from the list of beneficiary countries. Further, note 2(d) to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTS is modified by deleting ""Central African Republic;"", ""Niger;"", and ""Republic of Uganda;"" from the list of lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.

(7) The modifications to the HTS set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2024.

(8) In order to implement tariff commitments under the 2004 Agreement through December 31, 2024, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I of this proclamation.

(9) The modifications and technical rectifications to the HTS made by Annex I of this proclamation shall enter into effect on the applicable dates set forth in Annex I of this proclamation.

(10) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.

You realize, if you have a prescription drug from any major drug company in America, I can take you to Toronto, Canada, London, Rome, any major capital in the world, and buy the same exact drug for sometimes half the price that you get here.
Look, folks, when the Federal Government, through Medicare, doesn't have to pay out as much money, it means taxpayers pay less money, because you fund the Federal Government, you fund Medicare.
Go down every one of these things—it always confused me. They talk about being rational; it's just about excess profit. But any rate, I don't want to get off on that. I'll get carried away. [Laughter] I don't quite get these guys.
Thank you, Jim, for your friendship and, above all, for your fellowship. And, Bishop Green, thank you for those kind words. I mean that sincerely. And thank you, Reverend Manning, for, you know—the shepherd of this house—to allow me to stand at this podium once again. And to all the faithful of Mother Emanuel and distinguished guests.
I was talking downstairs. I've spent more time in the Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Delaware, than I have—than most people I know, Black or White—[laughter]—have spent in that church. [Laughter] Because that's where I started—no, I'm serious. It started with the civil rights movement. I used to go to 7:30 Mass, then I'd go to 10 o'clock service with the reverend who was then running the church, who's now the bishop. She's the bishop. And I'm told your bishop had been there before, in South Africa, because that's where he is right now.
The point is that I've been blessed to worship here before as well. You know, it's—at moments of joy and—great joy and moments of great pain, in moments of unbearable loss.
On June 17, 2015, the beautiful souls, five survivors—and five survivors invited a stranger into this church to pray with them. The word of God was pierced by bullets in hate and rage, propelled by not just gunpowder, but by a poison, a poison that's for too long haunted this Nation.
And what is that poison? White supremacy. Oh, it is. It's a poison. Throughout our history, it's ripped this Nation apart. This has no place in America. Not today, tomorrow, or ever.
From that day, this Nation saw this congregation, this community demonstrate one of the greatest acts of strength I have ever seen—I mean it sincerely, from the bottom of my—the act of forgiveness, the act of grace. It was, as President Obama sang from here, ""Amazing Grace.""
You changed hearts. You did something that may not have happened but for your courage. You brought down the Confederate flag in South Carolina. You brought it down. [Applause] No—you did. And you helped the Nation heal. You showed what America can overcome, what we can be when we want to be something.
I'm deeply humbled to speak from this same pulpit my friend—and he was a friend—Reverend Pinckney spoke from. We all miss him, none more than his family and this congregation. But just as all the families of the Emanuel Nine miss the pieces of their soul that they lost that day, we also have been together at moments of unbearable loss for my family.
Two days after the service of Reverend Pinckney, my son and I—my surviving son and I came back. My family worshiped with you here, Sunday service, to show our solidarity. But my family also needed to be healed. We didn't even realize how badly.
Just 22 days before, we had buried my son Beau, a veteran exposed and died because of those burn pits in Iraq for a year. We were—we were in more pain than we knew. We came here to offer comfort and received comfort from you. No, I'm serious.
As I listened in the pews, spent time with the families, visited Reverend Pinckney's office, visited the memorial for the victims outside, I grew stronger. My son, my family grew stronger.
We prayed together. We grieved together. We found hope together, for real—for real. And you know, it reminds me that, through our pain, each of us—each of us—must find purpose. For me, that purpose was to live a life worthy of my son Beau. And I mean it sincerely. For you, that purpose is for the lives worthy of loved ones lost—to make them proud.
So many of you were there for us during that loss, including my dear friend Jim and Emily Clyburn. Ms. Emily I miss. People of deep faith. Jim, a great public servant and the best friend you could ever have.
Jim, I'm thinking of Emily today, and we talked about it downstairs a little bit. I know you do every single, solitary day. She was special. And that bond you shared was something to behold.
As many of you know, Jim is a teacher and a student of history. He knows the power of history. He knows the power of truth and the power of lies. He knows what happens when people are allowed to whitewash history, erase history, bury history. He knows what the Bible teaches. We shall know the truth, and the truth shall set us free.
But the truth—the truth—is under assault in America. As a consequence, so is our freedom, our democracy, our very country because, without the truth, there is no light. Without light, there's no path from this darkness.
Audience member. If you really care about the lives lost here, then you should honor the lives lost and call for a cease-fire in Palestine!
Audience members. Cease-fire now! Cease-fire now! Cease-fire now!
The President. That's all right. That's all right. That's all right.
Audience member. Will you call for a cease-fire?
Audience members. Cease-fire now! Cease-fire now! Cease-fire now!
[At this point, security staff escorted some members of the audience out of the sanctuary.]
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Look, folks, I understand their—I understand their passion. And I've been quietly working—I've been quietly working with the Israeli Government to get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza. I've been using all that I can to do that.
But I understand the passion.
Look, folks, after the Civil——
Audience member. You're an understanding person. You're an understanding person.
The President. Thank you.
Audience member. They don't realize that. You're a good man.
The President. Well, thank you.
Look, after the Civil War, the defeated Confederates couldn't accept the verdict of the war: They had lost. So they say, they embraced what's known as the Lost Cause, a self-serving lie that the Civil War was not about slavery, but about States' rights. And they've called that the noble cause.
That was a lie, a lie that had—not just a lie but it had terrible consequences. It brought on Jim Crow. So let me be clear for those who don't seem to know: Slavery was the cause of the Civil War. There is no negotiation about that.
Now—now—we're living in an era of a second lost cause. Once again, there are some in this country trying—trying—to turn a loss into a lie, a lie, which if allowed to live, will once again bring terrible damage to this country. This time, the lie is about the 2020 election, the election in which you made your voices heard and your power known.
Just 2 days ago, we marked the third anniversary of the dark—one of the darkest days in American history: January the 6th, the day in which insurrectionists stormed the United States Capitol, trying for the first time in American history to stop the peaceful transfer of power in the country.
We all saw with our own eyes the truth of what happened. That violent mob was whipped up by lies from a defeated former President—smashing windows, smearing blood on statues, ransacking offices. Outside, insurrectionists erected gallows, chanting ""Hang Mike Pence."" Inside, they hunted for Nancy Pelosi, chanting ""Where's Nancy?""
We saw something on January 6 we'd never seen before, even during the Civil War. Insurrectionists waving Confederate flags inside the halls of Congress built by enslaved Americans. A mob attacked and called Black officers, Black veterans defending the Nation those vile of racist names.
And yet an extreme movement of America, the MAGA Republicans, led by a defeated President, is trying to steal history now. They tried to steal an election. Now they're trying to steal history, telling us that violent mob was, and I quote, ""a peaceful protest.""
That that insurrection—those insurrectionists were—these are his words—""patriots."" That there was, quote, ""a lot of love that day."" In fact, the rest of the Nation and the world saw a lot of hate and violence.
For hours, the defeated former President sat in the private dining room off of my—off of the Oval Office and did nothing, nothing—absolutely nothing. His actions were among the worst derelictions of duty by any President in American history. An attempt—[applause]. An attempt to overturn a free and fair election by force and violence.
Let me say what others cannot. We must reject political violence in America. Always—not sometimes, always. It's never appropriate.
The violence of January 6 was an extension of an old playbook from the—from the threats and violence and intimidation.
In Atlanta, Georgia, two brave Black women, mother and daughter—Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss—they had their lives upended just doing their jobs—menacing calls, death threats, forcing them to literally flee their homes.
Those pushing the ""big lie"" have a conspiracy theory among conspiracy theories that outweighs them all that there's what—and—but here is the fact. There is where we don't have facts—their whole theory has no facts, has no proof, has no evidence. That's why, time and again, they lost in every court of law that challenged the results—60 losses in courts of America.
There's one thing they don't have. They don't have respect for the 81 million people who voted the other way—voted for my candidacy—and voted to end the Presidency.
In their world, these Americans, including you, don't count. But that's not the real world. That's not democracy. That's not America. In America, we all count. In America, we witness to serve all those who, in fact, participate. And losers are taught to concede when they lose. And he's a loser.
Then we all came together to put the country before ourselves.
The lies that led to January 6 are part of a broader attack on the truth America today that we all have seen before. The same movement that, throughout the mob at the United States Capitol, isn't just trying to rewrite history of January 6, they're trying to determine to erase history and your future: banning books; denying your right to vote and have it counted; destroying diversity, equality, inclusion all across America; harboring hate and replacing hope with anger and resentment and a dangerous view of America.
That narrow view of America, a zero-sum view of America that says: ""If you win, I lose. If you succeed, it must be, I failed. If you get ahead, I fall behind."" And maybe worst of all, ""If I hold you down, I lift myself up.""
That's not new in America. Every stride forward has often been met with ferocious backlashes from those who fear the progress, from those who exploit that fear for their own personal gain, from those who traffic in lies told for profit and power.
But here in Charleston, you know the power of truth. Less than a mile from here was once a port where almost half of all enslaved Africans were trafficked to North America and forced on our shores.
And now you have a world-class museum there to tell the truth about the original sin. And it matters. And I want to thank former Mayor Jim [Joe; White House correction] Riley for his leadership, who saw to it the museum was built, and for all of you who made that happen.
And with your help, I made Juneteenth the first Federal holiday since Dr. Martin Luther King's Day.
[The President picked up a handheld microphone.]
This works?
Why? Because the truth matters. The truth matters.
With your help, we established the national monument—monument in honor of Mamie and Emmett Till because we heard Mrs. Till's call—the mother of a 14-year-old son who was lynched and whose body was mutilated, but the mother insisted on an open casket at his funeral because she said, ""Let the world see what I saw.""
The truth matters. It always matters. We can't just to learn—choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know. We should know the good, the bad, the truth of who we are.
That's what great nations do, and we're a great nation, the greatest of all nations. We're not perfect. But at our best, we learn from our past, and we look to the future. A nation continuously striving to be a more perfect Union.
I'm here to speak to another truth. It's because of this congregation and the Black community of South Carolina and—not an exaggeration—and Jim Clyburn that I stand here today as your President—because of all of you. That's a fact. [Applause] That's a fact. And I owe you.
Audience member. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. And I've done my best to honor your trust. That means rejecting the small, narrow, cramped view of America as well as lifting up a bigger and broader view of America that holds that: ""If you do well, I do well. We all do well.""
We all do well if every race and background in small towns and big cities is doing better; when our freedoms are protected and we deny hate as a safe harbor; where everyone has a fair shot at a life of dignity and opportunity; and where our democracy works for everybody.
That benefits everybody. I don't get these guys. Everybody does better, even those folks who disagree with us. And I'm keeping my commitment to you. That's the America we're building together. Instead of erasing history, we're making history.
And it starts—[applause]. And it starts with an administration I committed to—I said my administration would look like America and taps into our full talents and strengths as a nation, starting with our incredible Vice President, Kamala Harris.
When we came to office, the country was in a depth of a pandemic which we lost over a million 200,000 people, so we moved heaven and earth to get the country vaccinated, saving countless lives. With the economy on the brink, we spent—we sent $1,400 checks into the pockets of people who are hurting badly, keep them going.
I said we'd invest in all of America—all America—and we are. The results are clear: over 14 million new jobs, record economic growth, the lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the world. But we have more to do.
We see this progress for all Americans. We have the lowest Black unemployment rate recorded in a long, long time. More Blacks, Americans have health insurance than ever, bringing peace of mind and dignity to their lives.
I remember when I was a kid. We lived in a three-bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop living with us. And my headboard in my room was up against—it was a little split-level home. It was a—we weren't poor. We were—anyway, we weren't—we sure weren't worth—the wealthy.
And I remember really, one night, hearing my dad was restless, because the headboard was along my headboard, on the other side of the wall. And I asked my mom the next morning, I said, ""What's the matter with Dad?"" She said, ""Honey, his employer just told him they're dropping health insurance.""
What that does is, it deprives a man and a woman of their dignity. How do you look at your child and say: ""I can't cover you. I can't take care of you.""
And now, as Jim pointed out at one point—I won't go into it like I was going to because he said it better—instead of about an average of $400 a month for insulin for seniors with diabetes, we're now paying $35 a month. And by the way, they're still making a profit three times. It costs $10 to make it.
And I've been trying to take on—as a couple of you in the audience know from my entire career—Big Pharma. Finally beat them. Finally, finally, finally.
And we're going to go back and make sure that Medicare can negotiate prices for everybody, not just for seniors. Again, it saves the American taxpayers billions of dollars not having to pay Pharma for these things.
You know, we're growing back—Black wealth, and we have a lot more to do. The racial wealth gap is the smallest it's been in 20 years under my watch. More Black small businesses starting up than in decades in the ultimate act—opening a new business is the ultimate act of hope.
We're taking on housing discrimination in many ways. So a home owned by—today, a home owned by a Black family on one side of a highway, built by the same builder on the other side of the highway and a White guy living in it, the White guy's home is valued more than the Black guy's.
No, I know you know it. But guess what? That's how you build generational wealth, when you build your home.
Kamala and I are leading the charge of—mainly Kamala—to protect the freedom to vote and that vote—that be counted. Defending your freedom to choose. We're keeping our commitment of providing incredible opportunities, making historic investments in HBCUs: $7 billion—$7 billion.
They're just as good as other universities, just only that they don't have the billionaire contributors, so they can't put the laboratories together to get the contracts to be the ones that design new aircraft carrier decks, being the ones to design—what's changing—it's changing.
Providing people a real shot by reducing the burden of student debt—Jim went into it; I won't go into it as I was going to—$132 billion [million; White House correction], 3.6 million people—a significant percentage of those students are African American students—despite our friends on the other side of the table, the Supreme Court did [doing; White House correction] everything we [they; White House correction] can to stop me.
Replacing every lead pipe in America. You know how many—not just some. Every single lead pipe in America is going to be taken out and replaced with a—[inaudible].
Why? Because in mostly poor neighborhoods, that's where those lead pipes are. And that's why kids end up with brain damage because of the lead. There's so—I'm not going to go into it. But look, you can turn on a faucet for your child and doesn't get sick from drinking water in their—coming into the home.
Delivering high-speed internet that's affordable for everybody—everybody—so you don't have to sit in the McDonald's parking lot for your child to do their homework. Producing clean energy so you can finally breathe clean air without leaving home.
Look, I understand it. When we moved from Scranton—I was raised in Claymont, Delaware. More major refineries than any place, including Houston, Texas, and just across the border in Chester. Not a joke.
I grew up with asthma, and most of us did, because of the prevailing winds. We'd go—my mom would drive us to school in the morning when I was young—grade school—turn on—when there was a frost, turn on the windshield wipers, there would be an oil slick on the wiper. Because guess what? It's all the fenceline communities who get hurt.
Not on my watch. It's changing.
We know there's more to do: making childcare and eldercare more affordable, which would save American taxpayers billions of dollars along the way.
Early in my administration, we were out—we cut child poverty in half—child poverty—Black child poverty in half by getting families checks every month through the childcare tax credit. And the other side had—went ahead and blocked it. But we're going to get it back.
This—[applause]. Look, this fight isn't over. We're going to come back. Because no child in America should ever go to bed hungry, period, period, period, period.
After the historic movement for justice in the summer of 2020, I signed the most significant police reform Executive order in history. We didn't get the law passed, but guess what? I did it by Executive order, a significant part of it. But now Congress has to step up and ask and get it—do what I did and make it the law of the land.
Just a few days ago, the defeated former President was asked about the recent shooting in Iowa. Did you hear this one? I'm—it's hard to believe. You know what his response was, all those kids dead? We ""have to get over it,"" end of quote.
I promise you——
[The President made the sign of the cross.]
We ""have to get over it."" My response is: We have to stop it so your children, your family, your friends can leave your home, walk the streets, go to stores, go to the grocery store, and go to church, to be safe from gun violence. There's no excuse for this carnage.
We have to ban assault weapons. I did it once before, and I'm going to come back again and do it. Ban high-capacity magazines. We have to pass a—universal background checks. It doesn't violate the Second Amendment. It's common sense, and it saves lives.
I'm determined to continue to deliver on equal justice under the law. I made a commitment to you to nominate the first Black woman—and Jim has already talked about it—on the Supreme Court. And by the way, she's smarter than the rest of these guys. [Laughter] Whoa. Her name is Ketanji Brown Jackson. Well, guess what? She knows what she's doing.
And by the way, as Jim pointed out, more Black women have been appointed to the Federal Circuit Courts than every other President in American history has appointed, every single, solitary one counted. And we're going to keep going.
Look, I want to make it clear: You all made this possible because of your voice. Your voice was heard in shaping your destiny. That's democracy.
And I'm proud to have led the effort to make sure your voice, the South Carolina voice, will always be heard, because now you're first in the primary.
Look, our North Star as a nation is the very idea of an American [America; White House correction]—an idea, at once the most simple and most powerful idea in the history of the world—that's not hyperbole—a fact. The idea is this: We're all created in the image of God equally. We deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. That covet—it's a covenant we made with each other, a covenant we've never fully lived up to, but we've never fully walked away from either.
And faith and history teach us that however dark the night, joy cometh in the morning. And that joy comes with commands from scripture: ""Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, all thy mind, all thy soul,"" and ""Love your neighbor as thyself."" Not so easy. It's hard. But in those commands is the essence of the gospel and the essence of the American promise.
And in my life, I've tried to live my faith. And I've many times failed. But I've learned, as many of you might have learned in your path as well, we're all—we're all—imperfect beings. We don't know where fate will take us or when. But we can do our best to seek a life of light, hope, love, and justice and truth.
Folks, let me close with this. Denmark Vesey arrived in Charleston enslaved—one of too many—too many from a distant shores, wrenched from painful—on a painful journey, not to a promised land, but to a land that promised to deprive them of freedom.
But even though they arrived in the land where the life and rife of [a land that would be rife with; White House correction] pain and persecution, they still believed they had promise, and the Black Church kept them moving. They had faith. They found scripture. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, evidence of things not seen.
Vesey had his kind of faith. He became a carpenter and a movement leader concerned with the least among us. That's why he helped found this very church 200 years ago. Only 40 years after the Declaration of Independence, in this church, your church now, the Black Church has some to—come to symbolize the faith and this purpose, to bear witness to those who are suffering, to bring the good news of a future to come, to follow its mission to be the light in the pathway of darkness.
That's patriotism. That's patriotism: to love something so much you make it better, no matter the struggle; a patriotism that inspired generation before us to believe that in America we can do and be anything we want to be.
In our time, there's still the old ghost of new—in new garments. And we all need to rise to meet the moment, and the moment is now.
Folks, my fellow Americans, this is a time of choosing, so let us choose the truth. Let us choose America. I know—I know—we can do it together. And as the gospel song sings: ""We've come too far from where we started. Nobody told me the road would be easy."" ""I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me.""
My fellow Americans, I don't think the good Lord brought us this far to leave us behind.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you."""

A Proclamation
The constitutional right to practice our faiths peacefully and openly is a core tenet of our democracy and helps us fulfill one of our highest aspirations as a Nation: to be a citadel of liberty and a beacon of freedom. On Religious Freedom Day, we renew our pledge to protect that right by ensuring each person of any faith or belief can live out the deepest convictions of their conscience with dignity and respect.
Like so many Americans, faith has sustained me throughout my life—serving as a reminder of both our collective purpose and our responsibilities to one another. But for far too many people today, practicing their faith means facing fear and intimidation. In recent years, hate has been given too much oxygen. This year, in the wake of Hamas' brutal terrorist assault against Israel, we have seen horrific threats and attacks in this country that have both shocked our collective conscience and broken our hearts.
It is in the most challenging times that our commitment to freedom matters most. We must work harder than ever to practice the values that make us who we are. That is why my Administration is working tirelessly to protect and preserve the right to freedom of religion for everyone everywhere.
In 2022, I established a new inter-agency group to counter Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination within the United States. Last May, my Administration released the first-ever United States National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, which outlines more than 100 new actions we are taking to raise awareness of Antisemitism, protect Jewish communities, counter Antisemitic discrimination, and build solidarity across diverse communities. We are also developing the first-ever United States National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination in the United States, which will address the scourge of hate against Muslims in America. The strategy will also address hate against Sikh, South Asian, and Arab American communities, among others. Meanwhile, we continue to work with all communities to identify, prevent, and disrupt threats.
Everyone must be free to practice their faith without fear, whether they are gathering for worship, attending a religious school, participating in the activities of other faith-based organizations, or simply walking down the street wearing the symbols of their faith. That is why, working with the Congress, my Administration secured the greatest increase in funding in our history for the physical security of non-profits—including churches, gurdwaras, mosques, synagogues, temples, and other places of worship. In my 2024 Budget proposal to the Congress, I requested that this funding be raised to $360 million, and my Administration works continually to protect places of worship, including through an annual Protecting Places of Worship Week of Action. Through such initiatives, we are providing resources for faith communities and encouraging religious organizations to share their best practices in promoting security with one another.
As a world leader, we are also working to make it possible for people to practice their faith freely and peacefully around the globe. Billions of people worldwide are persecuted for or prevented from freely choosing, practicing, or teaching their faith. Repressive governments and violent extremists continue to reach across borders and target people for their beliefs. We have seen these abhorrent attacks on people of all faiths, including Christians in some countries. That is why, since the beginning of my Administration, we have provided more than $100 million to promote religious freedom and hundreds of millions more to provide humanitarian assistance to victims fleeing religious repression, including genocide. Further, we are denying the entry of goods into the United States that are made with forced labor—an abuse of human rights that is oftentimes associated with the genocide of religious minorities. We have imposed sanctions, visa restrictions, and export controls on actors and entities that are responsible for serious human rights abuses like religious persecution.
On this day, we recognize that the work of protecting religious freedom is never finished. In our quest to build a more perfect Union, may our faiths and beliefs help us heal divisions and bring us together to safeguard this fundamental freedom guaranteed by our Constitution and to ensure that people of all religions or no religion are treated with dignity and respect.
Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2024, as Religious Freedom Day.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.""	Proclamation 10697—Religious Freedom Day, 2024"
"Jan 14, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-100th-day-captivity-for-hostages-gaza-palestinian-territories,"Statement on the 100th Day of Captivity for Hostages in Gaza, Palestinian Territories","""Today we mark a devastating and tragic milestone: 100 days of captivity for the more than 100 innocent people, including as many as 6 Americans, who are still held being hostage by Hamas in Gaza. For 100 days, they have existed in fear for their lives, not knowing what tomorrow will bring. For 100 days, their families have lived in agony, praying for the safe return of their loved ones. And for each of those 100 days, the hostages and their families have been at the forefront of my mind as my national security team and I have worked nonstop to try to secure their freedom.

Since Hamas brutally attacked Israel on October 7, my administration has pursued aggressive diplomacy to bring the hostages home. We saw the first results of that effort late October, when two Americans were reunited with their loved ones. In November, working in close coordination with Qatar, Egypt, and Israel, we brokered a 7-day pause in fighting that resulted in the release of 105 hostages—including a 4-year-old American child—and allowed us to surge additional vital humanitarian aid into Gaza. I was deeply engaged to secure, sustain, and extend that deal. Sadly, Hamas walked away after just 1 week. But the United States and our partners have not given up. Secretary Blinken was back in the region this past week seeking a path forward for a deal to free all those still being held. I look forward to maintaining close contact with my counterparts in Qatar, Egypt, and Israel to return all hostages home and back to their families.

I will never forget the grief and the suffering I have heard in my meetings with the families of the American hostages. No one should have to endure even 1 day of what they have gone through, much less 100. On this terrible day, I again reaffirm my pledge to all the hostages and their families: We are with you. We will never stop working to bring Americans home."""

Q. How concerned are you with the Arab American votes during this election? And what Iowa means to you, to your reelection race?
The President. Well, I don't think Iowa means anything. The President got 50-some-thousand votes, the lowest number of votes anybody who's won got. You know, this idea that it's been a runaway, I think he can characterize it any way he wants. I'll let them make that judgment.
What was the second part of the question?
Former President Donald J. Trump/Arab American Voters/2024 Presidential Election/Situation in Gaza, Palestinian Territories
Q. The part was: Are you concerned with the Arab American votes voting for you during this election because of Gaza? Many say they will not vote for you.
The President. Well, look, the President wants to put a—the former President wants to put a ban on Arabs coming into the country. We'll make sure he—we understand who cares about the Arab population, number one.
Number two, we've got a long way to go in terms of settling the situation in Gaza.
[At this point, several reporters asked questions at once.]
March for Life in Washington, District of Columbia 
Q. The March for Life is tomorrow in Washington, DC—the March for Life is tomorrow in Washington, DC.
The President. Yes, I know that.
Q. What's your message to those attending?
The President. March.
[Several reporters asked questions at once.]
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Sir—sir, can you talk about inflation? When will prices come down?
2022 Shooting in Uvalde, Texas 
Q. Should anybody be held for—should anybody be held criminally responsible for failures after the Uvalde shooting? Should anybody be held responsible with criminal charges?
The President. I have not read the full report. The report will be out today——
Q. Today.
The President. ——number one. We're going to do what we can to implement the recommendations of the Justice Department. But I don't know if there is any criminal liability. I—I have not read the report.
Q. Were you—were you briefed by the Attorney General on this?
The President. I was briefed by my staff on it.
[Several reporters asked questions at once.]
The President. Thank you."""
"Jan 19, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-united-states-conference-mayors-and-question-and-answer-session-0,Remarks to the United States Conference of Mayors and a Question-and-Answer Session,"""The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Please—please sit down.
My dad used to have an expression: Quit while you're ahead. [Laughter]
I tell you what, I can't tell you how pleased I am to have you all here, and I mean it. For some of you, this is not your first visit. I know the new mayors, obviously it is.
But you know, Mayor Schieve—thanks for that introduction and your leadership of this conference.
A special thanks to the CEO of the Conference of Mayors, Tom Cochran—Tommy, how you doing, pal?—[applause]—who began his distinguished tenure in 1969. God bless you, pal. [Laughter] It's hell turning 50, isn't it?
U.S. Conference of Mayors Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director Tom Cochran. We're the same age. And Mike Bloomberg is the same age too. [Laughter]
The President. All right. But neither one of us have his money. [Laughter]
Well, thank you all, and welcome to the White House. I mean that sincerely.
Today we get some good news: We just signed a bill to keep the Government open. I thought about it when I signed it—[laughter]—but you know, some days, that counts as progress. [Laughter]
As many of you know, I started my career as a local official back in Delaware. And I only ran for Senate because serving locally was too hard. [Laughter] They know where you live and they think you can solve problems that are beyond your authority.
And believe me—[laughter]—all kidding aside, you have enormous respect for the—I have enormous respect for the jobs you do. I really mean it. You can't go anywhere without people knowing what you're doing. You—they know where you live. And they think you can solve every problem. [Laughter] No, I'm serious.
The fact is, you're answering key questions people ask every day: Is my neighborhood safe? Is it going to be okay? Will this bus get me to work on time? You know, my kids—will they—they going to have a good future in this town? Am I able to stay in my hometown?
It matters. It matters what you do. Mayors get the job done. And I'm not being—I'm not just being solicitous. Those of you who've known me for a long time know that's been my view from the time I got here as a United States Senator.
That's why I've filled my administration with so many former mayors, including Keisha Lance Bottoms, Steve Benjamin—Steve, good to see you—Mitch Landrieu, Marty Walsh, Secretary Buttigieg.
Pete turned 30 today. [Laughter] He got—my wife is going to—we have—she has a tradition in her family. Five and girls and one—five sisters—and at everybody's birthday, you've got to sing ""Happy Birthday."" So stand up, and let's sing happy birthday.
[At this point, the President led the audience in singing ""Happy Birthday"" to Secretary of Transportation Peter P.M. Buttigieg.]
And those of you who know my wife know I'm not kidding. [Laughter]
By the way, I tell every young man that's telling me ""I'm thinking of getting married"" or something like—I say, ""Look, I""—""You have any advice?"" I said, ""Yes, pick a family with five sisters or more."" And they look at me, ""What the hell is that all about?"" I said: ""It's really simple. That way, one of them always loves you. Not the same one."" [Laughter] You always have somebody on your side.
I want to thank Tom—Tom Perez for being the point person for so long. Where are you, Tom? There you are. Stand up, Tom. And I know he spent several days this week meeting with many of you, and I hope you—he was able to answer all your questions, because he always answers mine. [Laughter]
Folks, I made a commitment to be a President for all Americans, whether you live in a—whether you voted for me or not. And I mean it sincerely. Whether it—I made a commitment to rebuild from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down—give everybody a little bit of breathing room.
And you know, it's kind of interesting that I—a lot of folks who voted every—against everything I've done, they're announcing all these great projects. [Laughter] I tell them—and by the way, as many in blue States as red States, you know, and red States as blue, for real, because they're all Americans.
And here's the deal——
[A cell phone in the audience rang.]
I know. I know. [Laughter] Tell the former President that I'm busy right now. [Laughter]
Look, but I always say, some of the most ardent critics of me are announcing these great programs. And I say I have one comment: See you at the groundbreaking. [Laughter]
Look, I've kept those commitments, and so have you. And I—look at what we've been able to accomplish together. That's what I would like to talk a little bit about today.
I'm not going to take a lot of your time, but the things that are on top of mind for you. Look, when I came to office, the pandemic was raging. The economy was reeling. Cities nationwide faced devastating budget cuts. And together, we turned things around. You turned them around. You turned them around.
It started with the American Rescue Plan: $350 billion for State and local governments. Money to put cops back on the beat, teachers in the classroom, keep families in their homes——and train your workforces and get small businesses on their feet. Money directly to every single city in the country so you could decide how best to spend your money and meet your residents' needs without having to go through a statehouse or a Governor.
A lot of great Governors, a lot of statehouses. But you all know what you need better than anybody. I like it going directly to you. When I was a local official, I liked that a lot better. I liked the Delaware State Legislature when I was there. But guess what? They had—everybody had to get a piece of it—[laughter]—and my county wouldn't get what it needed. Any rate.
I followed that with the most significant investment in our Nation's infrastructure in generations: roads, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, public transit, clean water, high-speed internet, and so much more.
How can we have the best economy in the world if we don't have the best infrastructure in the world? Not a joke. We used to be number one in the world. You know what we rank now nationally—our infrastructure is rated worldwide? We're number 13. The United States of America is 13, from being number one. You can't lead the world unless you have the best infrastructure in the world.
Well, you're helping us change that. Now—now, we'll—we're going—on our way to leading the world again. Over four—40,000 new infrastructure projects announced to date and a hell of a lot more to come, with jobs now and jobs for the next decade.
I remember going through—remember we had Infrastructure Week? [Laughter] And then, we had Infrastructure Week. And then we had Infrastructure Week. And then we had—[laughter]. It never happened. Well, you've got an Infrastructure Decade. Because of you.
Just yesterday I was in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Audience member. Yes, sir.
The President. You've got it, man. [Laughter] Great city, by the way. [Laughter]
And we're investing $3 billion in the entire State for high-speed internet by the end of the decade. And we're doing that in all 50 States.
You know, Franklin Roosevelt brought electricity to rural America. That's what he did, because it wasn't there. And he realized that it was necessary to equalize the country and to grow the whole country.
Well, we're bringing high-speed internet to everyone in America. Rural—it's the same thing, the same necessities, critical to our economy. How do you get by in a city, a State, a town, your home without accessing internet—affordable access—we're not leaving anybody behind.
Yesterday, in North Carolina, I also highlighted a $1 billion we're investing in a new rail line from Raleigh to Richmond. And that's a billion dollars. It's going to create good-paying jobs, make travel faster, and it's going to improve the environment considerably by getting tens of thousands of cars off the road. Because every study shows, if you get a chance to go by electric rail and/or your car, you go by rail if it's the same time.
They've cut the point going from point A to point B. Look, right now is it takes about 3 hours to get that route. Cut it down to 2 hours. It changes everything.
And each of you could give examples of infrastructure projects of the one happening now in your States.
Look, with your help, we're also making the biggest investment in fighting climate change ever anywhere in the world—[applause]—in the world. We've got more to do.
Across your cities, we're working together to help small businesses install rooftop solar panels, electric buses—city fleets of all electric buses, planning—I just met with a lovely woman who knows a little bit about the environment, going to plant thousands of trees in her city, a million total—a million total. It's going to change the—protect against extreme heat and so much more.
My administration continues to work closely with you and your Governors and respond quickly to the wake of devastating floods, tornadoes, wildfires, and hurricanes.
By the way, when I started the job, I kept talking about the need for a deal with the environment. Said, ""We don't have a problem."" Anybody think climate is not a problem, raise your hand. [Laughter] Come on, man. [Laughter]
I've been around the world and on the ground with you, making sure to help strengthen the resilience and withstand the extreme weather and build back a stronger economy and bring back a stronger community. We're revitalizing fenceline communities smothered with the legacy of pollution. I grew up in one of those communities, and Delaware used to have the highest—one of the highest cancer rates in the Nation.
When we moved from Scranton—when jobs were eliminated in Scranton, we moved back to Delaware where my dad had been raised—to Claymont, Delaware, right on the border of Pennsylvania, that arc that goes up in it. More oil refineries than any place in the Nation, including Houston, at the time.
Well, guess what? Almost all my friends, including me, we had asthma. We'd go to—you know, my mom would drive us to the local school. It wasn't very far—a little Catholic school called Holy Rosary—up the Philadelphia pike. And if it was the first frost, you'd turn on the windshield wipers—this is the God's truth—and there'd be an oil slick in the window—an oil slick.
But you all come from places that have those alleys. You know—and we're promoting clean energy and industries of the future. Our workers are already drawing $640 billion in private investment at home and—from home and around the world—$640 billion. We're building factories. We're creating jobs here in America.
Let me give you one example. America invented the microchip, about as big as the tip of your little finger. Okay? We invented and—went to the Moon. We modernized it. We made it—it's necessary for everything from smartphones to dishwashers to automobiles. And over time, we went from producing 40 percent of the world's chips to producing less than 10 percent.
And that's when I signed the CHIPS and Science Act. I got on a plane—and maybe you thought I was a little nuts—and flew to South Korea. And I said, ""Why—why don't you come invest and build us those computer chips in America"" so we didn't have a supply chain problem. And went around—well, guess what? They did.
I asked the—I asked Samsung, ""Why are you investing so much money in America?"" They said, ""Because you have the best workers in the world, and it's the safest investment I can make, is in America.""
Now, semiconductors are investing literally hundreds of billions of dollars producing chips back home, here in America—your cities, your towns—so folks never have to leave home to get—excuse me—to get a good job.
And by the way, even with those historic investments that we've made over the last 3 years, we still reduced the deficit during this whole period. All those investments, we still reduced the deficit by $1 trillion.
And look, you all—a lot of you come from places like I grew up in, where there used to be that factory that employed 3,000, 2,000, 1,500 people. All of a sudden, it closed down. It was there for generations. People lost heart. People lost a sense of—literally, a sense of loss. And it's particularly those of you from the near-Midwest and the Midwest. Look at all the factories that picked up and moved.
Well, our economic agenda has ignited a manufacturing boom though: a semiconductor boom, a battery boom, an electric vehicle boom. We're making things in America, in every part of America, creating millions of good-paying jobs. By the way, 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. And if you work more than—by the way, you know, these new factories, they call them—when they're for—to build these new—these chips manufacturing facilities, they have what they call ""fabs"" factories.
They look like—and I've seen them. They look like great, big football fields in a stadium—I mean, rectangular fields. And guess what? You don't need a college degree. You know what the average salary is? A hundred and ten thousand dollars working there.
And what happens? The first one is being built outside of Columbus, Ohio, in what I call the ""Field of Dreams,"" a thousand acres there. What's happening there? Not only you build a factory, but you're going to end up having to build more filling stations, more beauty shops, more drugstores, more—everything moves when that's happening, when people have money to spend.
And it's clean, I might add. It's clean.
And when folks see shovels in the ground and people going to work on these projects, they can feel a sense of pride again.
Think what we did. Most of the major—I come from the corporate capital of the world—not a joke—Delaware. More corporations incorporated in Delaware than any—every other State in the Union combined—combined. And guess what? A lot of those corporations, they're not bad people, but they decided, ""Let's go with the cheapest labor in the world."" So they sent the jobs overseas—shut down the factories at home, sent the jobs overseas, and then imported the product.
Not anymore. We are sending product overseas, and we're importing the jobs. Pride in hometowns. I really mean it. Think about it. Think about it. What happens if you build up your—pride in America, pride in—people have pride when things start coming back—pride in knowing you can get big things done when your work together.
Look, folks, we know pride also means feeling safe in your neighborhoods. The fact that we've made enormous progress preventing and reducing crime through the American Rescue Plan. We've made one of the biggest investments in local public safety ever: over $15 billion. And much of it has gone directly to you to hire for your departments.
You've done a tremendous job. You really have. You've done a tremendous job putting these resources to work. You know how to do it. And I'm not being solicitous. Mayors are the people who get things done: hiring more officers for accountable community policing, investing in violence intervention programs proven to reduce crime.
With your support, I also signed the first gun safety law in 30 years. And we're working with you to implement it, to coordinate these efforts and create the first-ever White House Office—I—we—what we did, my staff came along and said, you know, we need a White House Office dedicated to getting guns off the street and threatening—and treating the trauma from gun violence, because there's a lot of trauma as a consequence.
So we're deploying teams to meet with communities that have been victimized to make sure they get the help they need. Working—it's working because of you, the mayors. But we've got to do a lot more.
You know, some of you may remember, a woman named Dianne Feinstein and Joe Biden passed the first assault weapons ban back when I was a Senator. And mass shootings actually went down. So I'm still committed to banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We've done it before, and we can do it again.
And we have to pass universal background checks. It doesn't violate the Second Amendment, for God's sake. I used to teach the Constitution at the University of Pennsylvania. Look, folks, the situation is simple. You know, when the—when we passed the Second Amendment, guess what? You weren't allowed to have a cannon. [Laughter] And you—no, I'm serious. Not a joke. You weren't allowed to have certain—you weren't—there were certain limitations of what you could have.
And I love—my friends and I come—the southern part of my State is very conservative, the Delmarva Peninsula. We talk at you like y'all talk sometimes. You know what I mean? [Laughter] But all kidding aside, it's just kind of amazing. They think that you could order—you could have anything. That never was the case. There's always been limitations on what you could purchase.
So, anyway, look—and I love people who say, ""The blood of liberty""—or excuse me, the—excuse me—""The tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots."" Well, guess what, man? I didn't see a whole lot of patriots that are out there walking around making sure that we have these weapons. Well—and if you really want to worry about the Government, you need an F-16. You don't need an AR-15. [Laughter]
No, I'm not—no, I'm serious. I mean, think about it. [Laughter] I'm not joking. Because that's one of the arguments made by the right, that we need to be able to protect ourselves against the Government.
Well, look——
Audience member. [Inaudible] [Laughter]
The President. If Jill were here, she'd say, ""Joe, hush up, boy."" [Laughter]
Across the country, violent crime is at—rates are falling. In some cities, it's going up, but overall—but not everywhere—overall, we are—we—they're falling, these rates—down nearly in every major category. Record declines in homicide. It matters.
And at some time, we've invested, in the last little bit, billions in improving mental health services to extend care, boost coverage, and address the causes of addiction and mental health issues. We're expanding mobile crisis services and community clinics. We're helping schools hire 1,400 new counselors. Mental health care is health care. It's health care. It's no different if you broke your arm, if you need help. We have a moral obligation to have our folks' backs.
And I want to thank you all—I mean it sincerely—I want to thank you all for what you're doing to support mental health all across the country. And that—the same is true for the fight to end homelessness and move people into supportive and permanent housing. We're your partner in this work.
We've got a lot more to do, I know. Across the country, I—a record 1 million new housing units under are—are under construction today. We're expanding our rental assistance to over 100,000 additional families, the biggest increase in 20 years, and have been working to cut red tape to make it easy for people to access Federal housing benefits.
You know, I've sent Congress an ambitious plan to do more: lowering housing costs, helping you build affordable housing, provide assistance for renters and first-time homebuyers.
And by the way, most of you come from families like mine. We weren't poor, but you know, we lived in a three-bedroom, split-level home when we moved to Delaware with four kids and a grandpop. We lived in a decent neighborhood; it was safe. But it wasn't what you'd call luxurious. And there wasn't much leftover.
My dad used to say: ""Joey, you know, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about decency. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, everything is going to be okay,' and mean it.""
Well, guess what? What we're doing is saving the Government money. Providing assistance for renters, first-time homebuyers, that's how people build equity. You build equity in your home, that's how you build wealth. So let's keep pushing, pass the plan into law.
And I want to talk about another top issue: the border. Now, I love how I turn on and: ""Biden is for a free open border. Just tear down everything. Let everybody come, no restrictions."" Well, one—I—used to be a bipartisan issue in this country, and it should be one again.
I've been clear from the very beginning: The system is broken. My first day in office, I sent Congress a comprehensive plan on immigration reform. My friends on the other side have done nothing with that.
Over and over, I've asked for resources to step up action at the border. In October, I asked Congress to fund—for funding that would add another 20 additional border—twenty—2,000 additional border agents and officers, hundreds of new immigration judges to make the judgments on the spot, a new—new detection equipment to stop fentanyl from coming into the country.
And by the way, I've worked with China and Mexico to slow the flow of fentanyl into the United States. As I speak, it's way down.
So let me be clear. My team has been at the table for weeks now on a partisan—with a bipartisan group of Senators to negotiate a deal, including border, because I believe we need significant policy changes at the border, including changes in our asylum system to ensure that we have authorities we need to control the border. And I'm ready to act.
I think—hope—""God willing and the crick not rising,"" as my grandpop would say—you know, I think next week, we ought to be able to work out something, at least in the Senate. And I'm hopeful it's going to be the bipartisan package the Senate is going to pass, God willing.
Now, the question is for the Speaker and the House Republicans: Are they ready to act as well? They have to choose whether they want to solve a problem or keep weaponizing the issue to score political points against the President. I'm ready to solve the problem. I really am. Massive changes—and I mean it sincerely.
Today, folks in America, with the incredible help of you mayors, we've created 14 million new jobs—14 million new jobs. Americans have filled 16—filed 16 new—16 million new business applications since I became President. That's a record. And every single one of them—think about it—it's an act of hope. Someone says they want to risk everything and open a new business, it's an act of hope.
Wages are rising. So is household wealth. We have the lowest inflation rate and the fastest recovery of any major economy in the world. And that's a fact.
In fact, today, costs are down on everything from a gallon of gas to a carton of milk. You know—I mean, look, I was down in Raleigh, as I said, the other day. I didn't pass by a gas station that wasn't under 3 bucks: $2.99, $2.87. I mean, come on.
And, folks—folks are starting to see it. Today I learned that consumer sentiment—and you guys saw it—surged by 29 percent in the last 2 months, the biggest 2-month jump in 30 years. We've got more to do. And that's not all though. We're lowering the costs of—for working class families across the board.
And by the way, it used to drive my dad crazy. My dad was a hard-working guy, an honest man who didn't get a chance to go to college because of the war, but he was a well-read guy. And the thing that bothered my dad more than anything else was what I call junk fees, the add-on fee by a corporation or a business just because they could do it.
For example, we're going after junk fees like banning banks and credit unions from charging fees for basic services, like checking your account balance. To check your account balance, you get a bill for 30 bucks. Come on. Or retrieving your bank records, 50 bucks. Some banks charge as much as, I said, 30 to 50 bucks for the services. But not anymore. For families like mine, that extra 30 bucks mattered when I was growing up.
And speaking of not—being not fair, without the help of a single person on the other side, we finally were able to reduce the exorbitant cost of prescription drugs. Any prescription—any one you're taking for any purpose in your town, you give me that prescription, and if I had the ability, I would take it to Ontario or Paris or Belgium and get it for anywhere from 60- to 30-percent less. Same company, same pharmacy, same pharmaceutical company, but that much less.
Look, folks, we finally allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices. I've been fighting that as a Senator for my whole 2,000-year career. [Laughter] Just like VA has been able to do for decades.
Insulin now—if you have diabetes, insulin is now cast—capped at $35 for seniors on Medicare—[applause]—after being average of $400. They're saving hundreds of dollars a month.
And by the way, starting next year, out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare is going to be capped at, total—no matter what—how many—no matter what the cost of your—you're paying, everything will be—you can't—don't have to pay more than $2,000 a year for every—and even the expensive cancer drugs, which costs $14-, $16,000 a year.
Folks, I'm going to keep fighting to lower costs for families across the board.
And by the way, guess what? I love it. They say, ""Well, you're spending all that money."" Guess what? That's money saved, billions of dollars the Federal Government does not have to pay, billions and billions of dollars. And that's a fact.
By the way, you know how much it costs to make that insulin? The guy who invented it didn't want to patent it because he wanted it available for everybody. You know how much it costs to make it? Ten dollars—t-e-n. Package it every way, add all the costs you could possibly think, another $2, maybe $3. And they're charging 400 bucks for it? Come on, man. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. I'm not joking.
But it saves the Government money. It's not the Government spending money. It saves the Federal Government billions of dollars a year—billions. And it's going to save more. We have more work to do, but we're going to keep moving forward together and, God willing, as partners.
Take student debt relief for public servants. You know, I know I wanted to forgive all student debt, and the Supreme Court said, no, I didn't have the authority to do that. Okay. But then I realized there's a public service requirement out there. If you engaged in public service for a serious amount of time—and by the way, the reason why any of you—I'm sure none—I'm not going to ask you if you have it.
Anybody had to pay for student debt for yourself and/or a kid or anyone, raise your hand. Guess what? The interest you're paying is more than, in fact, what the—the original bill was. Already, I've been able to forgive the debt for 3.7 million people who have gotten debt relief.
And by the way, when I originally got this passed, it was for everybody. And you didn't have to be a senior. For everybody. But my team was unable to get passed—I didn't have a bunch of mayors. I had a bunch of Senators and Congressmen. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, you know, I met yesterday in Raleigh with a dad, who was an impressive guy. And he was a Principal of the Year—picked as a Principal of the Year in his State. He had two young boys. He lived in a lovely small home. And—but he had a debt that—that was $124,000—student debt, much of it interest. And he never stopped paying, but he always kept his payments going—kept going up.
Well, guess what? That debt is now forgiven. And by the way, he's a former high school principal and now an executive coach for school—for a school district, teaching principals. He said this debt relief was a game changer for he and his family and his two boys I met.
One—I mean, their—I sat with them in their—in their kitchen for—and their dining room for the better part of 2 hours. Now he can stay in a town that he loves, take care of his children in a way that they're able to meet the basic needs he has.
It's not only fair, but it grows the economy. It grows the economy. So many who are being able to pay off their student debt are now able to go out and go buy a home, invest in a business, invest in other things and their families—to grow their families.
And, quite frankly, you, the mayors, are the key to all of this. I'm not blaming you if you don't want to be—take credit for it. But the point is—look, the fact is, you're the ones responsible. You're the ones people listen to. You talk to people. You speak plain English or Spanish or whatever language they're speaking, and you're able to speak to them directly, and you explain in simple language what we're doing.
Because, otherwise, people get really, really, really confused. We talk about—you know, for example, in the speech they put together for me to talk about the supplemental. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
[The President made the sign of the cross.]
[Laughter] You all know what I mean, the supplemental request I'm making to spend money. But no one knows what—I mean, people are busting their neck. Whether or not they have a college degree or not, you talk about a supplemental, ""What are you talking about?"" We've got to speak plain language to people. And that's what you do.
Look, let me close with this. Last week, I visited a small-business community owners near Allentown, Pennsylvania. Almost—almost Scranton—almost. [Laughter] Close.
Audience member. It's close.
The President. Almost Scranton. And if you notice, those of us who—everybody is from Scranton these days. [Laughter]
But you know, in my family—my mother, who was—married my dad when she was 24 years old, I guess lived in Scranton for those 20-some years and maybe another 10. My mother was in Delaware for 35 years, and then she'd be somewhere, and they'd say, ""Where are you from, ma'am?"" She'd say, ""I'm from Scranton."" [Laughter]
But look, they remind me how much our work matters. They said, back in 2020, when we were down, that they lost businesses, and they lost—this is in Allentown, all these folks I met. I met with business leaders, a bike owner, a—shop owner, et cetera. But then the laws we passed, they said, the work they'd all done together, helped them get back on their feet. They're able to support more cops, more firefighters in their community; more savings for health insurance because of the work we've done; more opportunities in manufacturing, infrastructure; new jobs, new businesses, and a new cycle of hope.
I know that sounds corny, but you're probably the only group who fully understand it. What do you want to give people who are hurting the most? Genuine hope—hope they can get something done, that there's a way out.
Places like Allentown, once left behind, are now coming back. I mean, for real. The folks I met in your cities and towns—[applause]—the folks I met in your cities and towns are a big reason why I've never been more optimistic about our Nation's future.
Like I said, I know I only look like I'm 40, but a little more than that. [Laughter] All kidding aside, I've been around a long time.
And I'm—I've never been more optimistic in my whole life about the prospects for America, relative to every other nation in the world. You know all the talk—I'm supposedly an expert on foreign policy because I've been doing it so much. Well, let me tell you, remember everybody said China is going to eat us alive? Give me a break. [Laughter]
China has got more problems than, as my dad used to say, Carter has little liver pills. [Laughter] I don't want them to do badly, but I don't—I want them to play fairly.
We're just—we're more—look where Russia is. Russia has lost 300,000 forces. I mean, we are now, if we don't lose our footing, in the most powerful position we've been since the end of World War II. We had that postwar period where we knew exactly what we were talking about.
But now—think about it—if we're able to maintain support for Ukraine so they don't fall, as Henry Kissinger—Henry Kissinger called me—asked me to call him about three weeks before he died. And I was a young Senator when he was the Secretary of State, so we had our run-ins and our agreements and disagreements. And he said, in one part of the conversation was—when I called, he said, ""You know, not since Napoleon—not since Napoleon—in France has Europe looked at Russia without fear until now.""
If we walk away—if we walk away—and Russia is able to sustain their onslaught and bring down Ukraine, what do you think is going to happen in the Balkan countries? What do you think is going to happen from Poland to Hungary and Orbán? I mean, seriously, think about it. It changes the dynamic, magnificent—I won't get on this—I'm not supposed to be talking about this, but same thing with regard to Israel.
Israel has to taper this off. There's ways to put this together. We're in a position where we're unable to—I think one of the reasons the Houthi—I can't prove this—one of the reasons the—Hamas did what they did was I was about to work out a deal with Saudi Arabia, wanting to normalize relations. I mean, fully normalize relations with Israel and bring along six other Arab nations to change the dynamic in the region.
Some of you attended the G-20 and—the 20 largest countries—the 20 heads of states from the major countries of the world. I got a resolution passed. Everybody thought I was nuts. Said that we're going to build a railroad from Riyadh all the way to England, going underwater—not with the railroad, but a pipeline through—it's going to go from Riyadh to Saudi Arabia to Jordan to Israel to so on and so forth.
Why? Because everybody understands their interest is better met when they had this interconnection economically.
Well, guess what? We have to remember—I'm going on too long. I apologize. But—[laughter]—we have to remember—I mean this from the bottom of my heart—we've got to remember who the hell we are. We are the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity—nothing, nothing, nothing—when we've been—done it together. Nothing.
We're the only nation in the world—think about this—that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in—no other nation in the world has done—because we've worked together. And the thing I love about you guys is you work together.
We're going to get this done, folks.
I want to now turn it over—[applause].
My grandfather—God bless you all. Now I'm going to turn it over to Tom, who's going—I'm going to take a few questions.
Office of Intergovernmental Affairs Director Thomas E. Perez. Thank you, Mr. President. Can we give it up for Mr. President?
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
Director Perez. The questions are over, Mr. President. [Laughter]
We're going to first turn to Mayor Holt of the great city of Oklahoma City.
Crime/Economic Stimulus Legislation/Gun Control 
Mayor David Holt of Oklahoma City, OK. Thank you, Tom.
The President. I want the record to show he didn't have to say, ""Four more years."" He's a Republican. [Laughter]
Mayor Holt. Mr. President, I know I speak for this bipartisan room of mayors when I thank you for having us here today. Thank you for the very deep participation that your administration has had in our meeting these last 3 days. And, most importantly, thank you for your obvious commitment to our urban priorities these last 3 years. We're so very grateful.
I want to ask a quick question. You alluded to this a little bit. I think I can give you an opportunity to expand on it. Obviously, as mayors, we face countless challenges and opportunities. But it seems that, at the end of the day, the most important one is always public safety. Obviously, public safety and law enforcement is often thought to fall under the jurisdiction of local government, but we have long had a partnership with the Federal Government in that.
And I think we'd all just love to hear—obviously, we're gratified, as you alluded to, that crime rates have fallen across the country this past year. But I think we'd all love to hear: What are your thoughts and plans moving forward for how the Federal Government can partner with cities to continue that momentum and to help us keep our communities safe?
The President. Well, thank you, Mr. Mayor. Look, I spent a significant portion of my career as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which did almost all the crime legislation that exists. And in the last administration—in 2020, for example, we had the largest increase in murders we've ever had in all of America. Not blaming it on the—that President, particularly.
But think about what was happening. We had a lot of crises going on. We had the whole—the beginning of the pandemic, which wasn't being acted on. We had a lot of people just very, very upset, worrying about where they were. Mental health was deteriorating.
And so, when I got elected, I acted to turn it around. And so have you. In 2023, violent crime came down significantly. It's one of the largest yearly declines of homicide ever.
And the American Rescue Plan, which was a very, very big facility for you guys to draw on, was one of the largest investments in public safety ever. More police officers were put on the beat, invested in violence prevention, and it was because you did it and you made—you had the money, and you made the investment.
And I signed—we signed the first meaningful bipartisan gun safety legislation. It still helped a lot, these phony gun—anyway. A whole—I won't go into it. But you did a whole lot.
But mainly, we were able to bring more police officers on and raise the standard—raise the standard—expected of them. I—anyway.
But you know, we're in the—it took executive action to keep illegal guns out of our cities, and that's what we're doing. And you're doing it as well. And I need—look, more is needed. A hundred thousand more community police officers on the beat, I think, is what's needed nationwide—another hundred thousand.
And we have to fund mental health counselors. You know, what we found is that if in fact—you know where most law enforcement officers are getting killed? Responding to domestic violence. You know, we expect our cops to do everything. We except them to be counselors, we expect them to be psychologists, we expect them to be tough guys and women.
But you know, the—what you want to do, you want to have someone stop—trying to stop someone from jumping off the top of the roof, you need somebody who has a background and expertise. So we're hiring into the police departments people with different skills than just being able to tote a gun and physically protect.
And so I think that, you know, one of the reasons I appointed Vivek Murthy—Admiral Murphy to become this—the Solicitor—excuse me, become the guy in charge of the whole mental health piece of this operation is because he understands it. And he talks all the time about what we can do to engage in providing for mental health facilities around the world—around your cities and communities so people can have the help they need.
And look, you know, we—and look, I know it's very controversial. I know it's a red, hot-button issue for a lot of Democrats and Republicans. I come from a State that, back when I was a Senator, had—I think it was the third highest gun ownership in America. And I don't know what it is now, but—because of a lot of duck hunting in the Delmarva Peninsula and a lot of other reasons.
And I know how unpopular it was when I started talking about banning assault weapons. Who needs an AR-15 that can hold a hundred rounds? Not a joke.
I was campaigning when I was running for reelection as the last time as a Senator, and I was down in the Delmarva Peninsula, just on the Maryland border, in where—in the swampy area, a lot of—and I'm walking through, and that's how—like you guys do. You campaign. You go where the people are.
I go through—and so I'm walking through in a pair of high boots, and a guy said, ""Biden, you SOB,""—[laughter]—and I said, ""What?"" He said, ""You want to take my gun away."" And I said, ""I don't want to take""—he was fishing. And I said, ""I don't want to take your gun away."" I said, ""You're able to have your gun."" He said, ""You want to take my AR-15."" I said, ""You must be one hell of a lousy hunter."" [Laughter]
And he looked at me, and he said, ""What do you mean?"" I said, ""You need an AR-15 that's basically a semi-automatic and can fact—fire off 20, 30, 50, 60 rounds?"" I said, ""My—the best—last time I checked, deer weren't wearing Kevlar vests."" [Laughter] And we just—got in the—and then he calmed down, got into conversation, started talking practically about what, in fact, happens—what, in fact, happens.
And you know, the other thing is background checks. There's always been a requirement of a background check. And now this 16-year-old kid who was able to buy an AR-15—anyway.
So I think we have to support community violence intervention programs as well. Many of you have those programs going in your cities, in your communities. And you're seeing they work. You get people engaged, and you get them involved.
And so there's a lot we can do—I think a lot more we can do. But two of the things are making sure there's background checks for people to purchase weapons, number one. And, number two, certain weapons you shouldn't be able to purchase because you never have—you're never—you're not able to go out and purchase a machinegun. I mean—anyway.
There's certain basic principles that are made—just make common sense. And I think—and, again, you can go back and look—if you want, I'll send you a copy of the study we did after the—the assault weapons ban lapsed, because it only could last for 10 years. I couldn't get it done again. And it's interesting. The number of mass shootings dropped precipitously—dropped precipitously—when we had that limitation. It doesn't solve every problem. It's one of the things we can do.
But any rate, there's a lot more to say. I'm probably already saying too much.
Director Perez. Our second and last question comes from Mayor Katie Rosenberg from the great city of Wausau, Wisconsin.
Lead Service Line Replacement Efforts/Drinking Water Safety 
Mayor Katie Rosenberg of Wausau, Wisconsin. Thank you so much. This is an absolute honor. Thank you for hosting us. You have a wonderful staff.
Just about a year ago, the Vice President hosted a lead pipe summit here in Washington. And I attended that, and it was like shooting me out of a cannon. I ran home, and we started working on our plan to shore up, pull out all of those lead pipes, and we made our plan—a 15-year plan down to a 5-year plan.
But I'm curious, what other progress are we seeing about these lead pipes being removed across our Nation? It's really important that we get that out of our drinking water. Thank you.
The President. Well, first of all, thank you for what you're doing. I agree with you.
Let me put this in perspective. The research by the doc shows that reducing lead exposure for children has—this is a study that was done—[inaudible]—has the same effect on test scores—just take test scores at school—on test scores as reducing class size from 22 to 15 students and less—one-tenth of the cost. Let me just give you one example of the impact it has on IQ formation and the ability to think and the like. So it's a significantly smart investment, number one.
Number two, we have enough money, and we're going to eliminate every lead pipe in America. Every one.
It's going to take us—it's going to take us about 10 years, but every single one. Because you shouldn't—think about it. You've got 400,000 schools, kids going to the water fountain and drinking water—you know, water. You got so much else that's going on. And it can just—and it makes a lot of sense.
And by the way, it creates a hell of a lot of jobs too. [Laughter]
But my point is, it just is—look, exposure to lead impacts on brain development—we know that, particularly for as it's developing—a hazard to the health of people, it can damage the brain and the kidneys and interferes with the production of blood—of red blood cells that need to carry the hydrogen. And studies show that lead exposure hurts cognitive function in children and can even knock off several points of their IQ.
Despite these dangers—the knowledge of how dangerous this is, we're in effect—where the CDC estimates that over half of American children could be exposed to lead, with the exposure often coming from their own homes with lead pipes. And it costs a hell of a lot of money to take that pipe from the watermain to the house. It costs a lot of money. A lot of people can't even remotely afford doing it.
But everybody is better off—everybody is better off—when we get the lead pipes out of the system. And look, our ambitious goal is to remove all lead pipes in America by—within 10 years. The bipartisan infrastructure law financed over 1,200 drinking water and wastewater projects, and it's going to replace hundreds of thousands of lead service lines in America beginning right away. Ongoing efforts in cities like Wausau and Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey. They create good-paying jobs as well—good-paying jobs.
And I visited the Hero Plumbing in Milwaukee, by the way, a Black-owned small business that was—replaced over 600 lead pipes in homes and daycare centers.
Well, guess what? Ten-year effort to bring these—is to bring these States, Tribes, and labor unions water utilities and private companies together to deliver clean drinking water to every community in the world—in America. And so it just seems to me that it's one of those things—who the hell can be against clean water? Except some of the people I know. But—[laughter].
But all kidding aside, if there's anything you're going to expend money on, you want to increase the prospect of growth in schools, I mean, this was a—that study, extensive study done. It makes a big difference in terms of the ability to learn and ability—and long-term impacts on cognitive capability.
But I'm convinced we can get it done. I'm convinced we can get it done.
Thank you all very much. You're very patient. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You're all welcome to spend the night. [Laughter]
By the way, have you—have you had a chance to see most of the White House yet? Not all the—well, you ought to take—I don't know, I might get myself in trouble here. [Laughter]
But you know, there's—downstairs, there's a lot of interesting rooms you can check out. And up here, the dangerous part of up here is that it's hard to know what room you're in because all of them are identified by color. [Laughter] The Red Room, the Blue Room, the Green Room—it's not—
But all kidding aside, welcome to the White House. This is your house, and I was getting in the elevator to come up, and my introducer—where is she? There she is. I said every time that I hear ""Hail to the Chief,"" I wonder, ""Where the hell is he?"" [Laughter]
Mayor Hillary L. Schieve of Reno, NV. [Inaudible]—playing your song.
The President. That's right.
Mayor Schieve. That's what my sister says about me being mayor. [Laughter]
The President. Anyway, thank you, thank you, thank you for everything you do."""

Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe!
The President. Yesterday—yesterday marked the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, which recognized a woman's constitutional right to choose, her right to make the deeply personal——
Audience member. [Inaudible]
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. We're going to have—this is going to go on for a while.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
Audience member. [Inaudible]
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. We've got a couple more of these, I think.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. And, folks, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right, and so do a majority of Americans. And they still do.
We all know what happened a year and a half ago: A new Supreme Court made an extreme decision overturning Roe v. Wade with their—with their Dobbs decision.
Audience member. [Inaudible]
Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe!
The President. I'm sorry this is taking so long.
Folks, the Supreme Court did what it never had done before: It ripped away a fundamental constitutional right that was in place for nearly 50 years and that was so important to so many Americans for so long.
As I said on that day, the health and lives of women in this Nation would be at risk and the consequences of this decision.
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. That's exactly what happened.
Today, in America, women are being turned away from—emergency rooms, forced to travel hundreds of miles to get basic health care, forced to go to court to plead to help to protect themselves and the ability for them to have children in the future. The cruelty is astounding.
And it's a direct affront to a woman's dignity to be told by extreme politicians and judges to wait, to get sicker and sicker before anything can happen, even to the point where, as you heard, your life had been determined to be in danger.
Or the idea that a woman should have to carry a fetus after she's been raped or the victim of incest—it's outrageous. It's outrageous.
Or the idea—a woman receives competent medical advice that the fetus she is carrying won't live and will impact on her ability to have children in the future, and she still can't get medical care. I think it's unconscionable.
Did anyone think—did anyone think that this is where America was going in 2024?
Audience members. No!
The President. I could go on. But look—and let there be no mistake—the person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Listen to what he says. Trump says he's ""proud"" that he overturned Roe v. Wade. He said, and I quote, there has to be ""punishment"" for the women exercising their reproductive freedom. He describes the Dobbs decision as a ""miracle."" But for American women, it's a nightmare.
So let's be absolutely clear what Trump is bragging about. The reason there are 21 States where abortion bans are in effect, may [many; White House correction] with no exception for rape or any other—or incest, is Donald Trump.
The reason women are being forced to travel out of State——
Audience member. [Inaudible]
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. This is going to go on for a while. They've got this planned.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. [Laughter] The reason women are being forced to travel across State lines for health care is Donald Trump. The reason their family members are trying to get help—them to—are threatened with—with prosecution is because of Donald Trump. And the reason their fundamental right has been stripped away is Donald Trump.
And because of Donald Trump, doctors are fleeing their home States, setting up practices in other States, because they're afraid they'll be put in prison if they exercise their responsibilities. In States like Texas, doctors can get a life sentence for providing the care they were trained to provide. It's outrageous.
Audience member. [Inaudible]—is a war crime!
The President. And frankly, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans—including the woman hollering—[laughter].
Audience member. [Inaudible]
Audience member. Keep going!
The President. And frankly, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, are hell-bent on going even further. To date, MAGA Republicans in Congress have proposed three additional national abortion bans to criminalize health care in every State.
Let me tell you what they are. First is a zero-week ban with absolutely no exceptions. The second one introduced is a 6-week ban with a penalty for violating it—jail. And the third is a 15-week ban, and the penalty is a 5-year jail sentence. You know, and they're in Congress now.
In the past year, Trump himself endorsed a Federal ban, promising to ""lead the charge,"" God love him. [Laughter] And that means even if you live in a State where extremist Republicans are not in charge of the State Government, your right to choose, your right to privacy is still at risk.
But as long as I have the power of the Presidency, know this: If Congress were to pass a national abortion ban, I will veto it. I will veto it.
Look, MAGA Republicans—MAGA Republicans are trying to limit all women in America from getting a safe and effective medication—
Audience member. [Inaudible]
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. MAGA Republicans are trying to limit all women in America from getting a safe and effective medication, approved by the FDA to—for over 20 years now. They're trying to block women from getting this medication even in States where women's health care choices are still protected.
And if you live in a State where you cannot get care that you need and you make a plan to travel to another State to get the care you need, MAGA Republicans are trying to stop you as well.
And get this. In the State of Alabama, the attorney general is threatening to prosecute family members who help their loved ones travel to another State to get healthcare they need. That can't be America——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. That can't be America in 2024. It can't be.
So let's be clear that the Dobbs decision also puts at risk the broader rights of privacy for everyone. That's because the fundamental right to privacy, which Roe v. Wade recognized, has served as a basis for so many other rights that are part of the fabric of this country: the right to make the best decisions for your health, the right to—use birth control, the right to marry someone who you love.
Justice Thomas wrote as much in his concurring opinion in Dobbs that the future cases of the Court, he said, should be considered—reconsider all substantive due process precedents from Griswold on. That's what he said.
Look——
Audience member. [Inaudible]
[At this point, the President addressed audience members in the balcony.] 
The President. Please don't jump.
Folks, the extreme laws passed by Dobbs have no place in the United States of America. But what does have a place is your voice.
The Dobbs decision practically dared women of America to be heard. In writing, they said, ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" No kidding.
I said at the time, I don't think this Court and the MAGA Republicans have any clue about the power of women in America. I don't think they have any clue. But they're about to find out.
Since the Dobbs decision, all over this country, from Ohio to Kansas, Michigan, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and right here in Virginia, Americans have showed up—women and men of all races, all backgrounds—voting to protect the freedom to choose.
And there's one other person who doesn't have a clue about the power of women in America: Donald Trump.
Audience member. [Inaudible]—genocide.
The President. But look——
Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe!
The President. What I said is, there's one other person who doesn't have a clue about the power of women in America. It's Donald Trump. But I promise you, in 2024, he's going to find out about the power of you all.
We—[applause]. Oh, he—watch. We need the protections of Roe v. Wade in every State. And we can do it. You can do it. Together, we can do it. It's within your power to do it.
So let me be crystal clear. Today isn't just a day to remember the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, today is a day to call to action. With your voice, with your power, with your vote, we can restore the protections that had been around for over 50 years under Roe v. Wade.
We can—[applause]. We can—we can once again make it the law of the land in America. And we're going to do that. Are you ready to make it happen?
Well, to do that, we need a new Congress. Are you ready to make that happen? Give me a Democratic House of Representatives, and give me a bigger—a bigger Democratic Senate, and we will pass a new law restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade, and I will sign it immediately.
And let's remember: It was Donald Trump and his Supreme Court who ripped away the rights and freedoms of women in America. And it will be Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and all of you who are going to restore those rights for the women of America.
Donald Trump is betting we won't—you won't vote on this issue. But guess what? [Laughter] He's betting we won't hold him responsible either, for taking away the rights. He's betting you're going to stop caring.
Audience members. Boo!
Audience members. We have daughters!
The President. By the way—that you'll get distracted and discouraged and stay home.
Audience members. No!
The President. Well, guess what? I'm betting he's wrong. I'm betting you're the—won't forget. I'm betting you won't stop caring, that you won't get distracted. And I'm betting, come November, we will vote in a record number.
And when we do that, we'll teach Donald Trump a valuable lesson: Don't mess with the women of America unless you want to get the benefit.
Look, let me close with this. I believe 2024 is going to be the most important election we've had since 1864. I mean it.
And the reasons are clear. Democracy is on the ballot. Freedom is on the ballot, like the freedom to choose; the freedom to vote; the freedom to love who you want; the freedom to go to work, go to school, go to your house of worship without fear of being gunned down by a weapon of war.
So my question to you is simple: Are you ready?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Are you ready to defend democracy?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Are you ready to protect our freedoms?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. And are you ready to win this election?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Let's get this done. Talk to your families and friends. Organize your community. Register to vote. Get people to the polls.
And let's remember who we are: We are the United States of America. And there's nothing—nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
All right. You heard me say this before. Every time I'd walk out of my grandfather's house, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" Guess what? My grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it.""

"Jan 26, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-international-holocaust-remembrance-day-7,Statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day,"""Tomorrow, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we join nations around the world and pause to mourn one of the darkest chapters in human history, when 6 million Jews were systematically targeted and murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators in the Holocaust during the 1930s and 1940s. We also grieve the Roma, Sinti, Slavs, people with disabilities, LGBTQI+ individuals, racial minorities, and political dissidents who were abused or killed. And we honor the courage of survivors and the heroism of people who bravely stood up to the Nazis, risking everything to save innocent lives.
This year, the charge to remember the Holocaust, the evil of the Nazis, and the scourge of anti-Semitism is more pressing than ever. On October 7 Hamas terrorists unleashed pure, unadulterated evil on the people of Israel, slaughtering approximately 1,200 innocent people and taking hundreds more hostage—including survivors of the Shoah. It was the worst atrocity committed against the Jewish people in a single day since the Holocaust.
In the aftermath of Hamas's vicious massacre, we have witnessed an alarming rise of despicable anti-Semitism at home and abroad that has surfaced painful scars from millennia of hate and genocide of Jewish people. It is unacceptable. We cannot remember all that Jewish survivors of the Holocaust experienced and then stand silently by when Jews are attacked and targeted again today. Without equivocation or exception, we must also forcefully push back against attempts to ignore, deny, distort, and revise history. This includes Holocaust denialism and efforts to minimize the horrors that Hamas perpetrated on October 7, especially its appalling and unforgiveable use of rape and sexual violence to terrorize victims.
Under my Presidency and our first-ever National Strategy To Combat Antisemitism, we are continuing to condemn and fight anti-Semitism at every turn. Because sadly, these events remind us that hate never goes away. It only hides until it is given a little oxygen. And we must each do our part to ensure that hate in all its forms has no safe harbor anywhere in the world. It is our shared moral responsibility to stand up to anti-Semitism and hate-fueled violence at home and abroad and to make real the promise of ""Never Again.""
[***APP NOTE: The statement initially distributed by the White House also included the following two paragraphs that were not included in the version published in the Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents:]
It was a promise my father first instilled in me at our family dinner table, educating my siblings and me about the horrors of the Shoah. It is a lesson I have passed down to my children and grandchildren by taking them to the Dachau concentration camp in Germany, so they could understand for themselves the depth of this antisemitic evil and the complicity of silence or indifference. And it is a message that I have strived to honor during my visits to Israel and by inviting Holocaust survivors and Jewish hostage families to the White House – so the entire nation bears witness.
On this somber International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we hold the Jewish community and the people of Israel close in our hearts. We recommit to carrying forward the lessons of the Shoah, to fighting antisemitism and all forms of hate-fueled violence, and to bringing the hostages home. And we remember the enduring strength, spirit, and resilience of the Jewish people – even in the darkest of times."""
"Feb 01, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-prayer-breakfast-36,Remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast,"""Frank, thank you for that introduction.
And, Reverend Black, I've spent a lot of time with you in the United States Senate—36 years. But you were only there 21. But I miss your sermons, because that's how I viewed your opening prayers every month—every day.
Frank, thanks for the introduction and for your service on behalf of the people of Northwest Indiana. A few years ago, I visited Frank's hometown, Hammond, Indiana, with our dear friend and great Hoosier Joe Donnelly, who is doing an incredible job as our Ambassador to the Holy See, walking his faith in service of his nation as well—as we all are called to do.
So, Frank, thank you for leading this year's prayer breakfast, and Congressman Tracey Mann of Kansas as well.
Thank you, Speaker Johnson. It's an honor to be with you today and Majority [Minority; White House correction] Leader Jeffries. And Senators Gillibrand and Blackburn, thank you both.
The chair of the National Prayer Breakfast and Foundation, Senator Heidi Heitkamp. Heidi, I hadn't seen you in a while. It's so good to see you again, kid. [Laughter] It really is.
Members of the administration—Secretary Buttigieg, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace, who helped make this event what it is today.
Members of Congress and their families, including one of the home-State Senators—my home-State Senators, Chris Coons, who, by the way—he not only got a law degree, the same time he got a law degree, he got a divinity degree at Yale University, which makes me always wonder about him. I don't know. [Laughter] But, all kidding aside, he's a great man. And his wife Annie is with him today. They're both dear friends.
Chaplain Black, we've known each other a long time. And, on my last day in the Senate Chamber, you offered a prayer: that in our labor may we illuminate the darkness of doubt, may we distinguish between truth and falsehood, and may we see possibilities that are now hidden. Your wisdom then and now, this morning, are deeply moving.
To the incredible Andrea—[laughter]. I think—by the way, I am an unadulterated fan of Bocelli. He will tell you. And you know that to be the case. He—God, he can—anyway—[laughter]. He's incredible, I think.
Jill and I had the honor to host him for Christmas at the White House in our first year in office. And you performed with your son and daughter as if you were a choir of herald angels. And, in a difficult time for our family, after we lost our son Beau, you expressed in a song what we felt in our hearts.
From your song, ""Fall on Me,"" it goes like this. It says: ""Fall on me with open arms. Fall on me from where you are. Fall on me with all your light."" Andrea, well, you're a gift. You were a gift to my family at that moment, and you continue to be.
I've attended many prayer breakfasts over the years. And Jill and I have been humbled by the prayers of so many when we needed them badly. It means everything to us.
And we're all blessed to live in a nation where we can practice our many faiths and practice them freely and where we can come together and lift up our Nation and each other—each other—in our own prayers, especially in tough times.
Our prayers continue to be with the families of the three American servicemen [servicemembers; White House correction] killed and attacked in the FOB in Jordan: Sergeant William Rivers, Specialist Breonna Moffett, and Specialist Kennedy Sanders. I spoke with each of these families separately, and Jill and I will be, tomorrow, at Dover Air Force Base to receive the dignified transfer of their bodies.
They've raised [risked; White House correction] their lives in harm's way. They risked it all. And we'll never forget the [their; White house correction] sacrifices and service to our country that the [and that of the; White House correction] dozens of servicemembers who were wounded and are recovering now.
I also see the trauma, the. And I understand that the pain and passion felt by so many here in America and around the world. We value and pray for the lives taken and for the families left behind, for all those who are living in dire circumstances: innocent men, women, and children held hostage or under bombardment or displaced, not knowing where their next meal will come from or if it will come at all.
Not only do we pray for peace, we are actively working for peace, security, dignity for the Israeli people and the Palestinian people. I'm engaged in this day and night and working—as many of you in this room are—to find the means to bring our hostages home, to ease the humanitarian crisis, and to bring peace to Gaza and Israel—an enduring peace with two States for two peoples—just as we worked for peace, security, and dignity for the Ukrainian people as they show incredible resolve and resilience against Putin's aggression. We must continue to help them.
The challenge of our times reminds us of our responsibility as a nation to help each other [deliver; White House correction] just and lasting peace—deliver it abroad and here at home. That's why we're fighting against the rise of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia here in the United States and all forms of hate, including those against Arab Americans and South Asian Americans.
This is a calling to stand against hate, to remember the very idea of America: We're all created equal. We're unique in the world—the only Nation based on an idea—""We hold these truths to be self-evident""—because we're all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.
We've never as a nation fully lived up to that, but we've never walked away from it either. It's a covenant we have with one another that holds this Nation together. And, quite frankly, I knew it before I became President because I did a lot of foreign policy under—in the previous administration with Barack. But we're the beacon to the world. The entire world looks to us. That's not hyperbole.
This is an idea. This idea was made real before the soul became flesh, before this dream became a fact. It was prayed for, it was hoped for, it was believed in. That's the story of America.
Let me close with this. It's fitting today marks the first time the National Prayer Breakfast is being held here in Statuary—Statutory [Statuary; White House correction] Hall. This is where the House of Representatives met for 50 years leading up to the Civil War. It's where a Congressman from Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, sat at desk number 191 before becoming President who served our Union and saved it.
History remembers President Lincoln's first Inaugural Address counseling us to heed, quote, ""the better angels of our nature."" ""The better angels of our nature."" We'd do well to remember what he said just a few moments before he concluded the same address. At a moment of deep division in our Nation, President Lincoln said, ""We are not enemies."" He said, ""We are not enemies, but friends."" ""We must not be enemies,"" he went on to say.
I've long believed we have to look at each other even in our most challenging times not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. Scripture tells us, ""The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness."" I believe that's our collective calling today.
Here we are in this room, among the statue of heroes who have shaped our history. And here we know faith is a living spirit that awakens our passions to come down from the pedestal and act to serve.
That's why over the door of the Rotunda is a scripture [sculpture; White House correction] depicting Clio, the muse of history. In her hands is an open book in which she records the events taking place here. In the citadel of democracy, she is a silent witness to the American story of war and peace, insurrection and stability.
As we gather this morning, what will Clio write for the future about what we did in our time? What will she write about us? My prayer, my hope is, we continue to believe our best days are ahead of us; that as a nation we continue to believe in honesty, decency, dignity, and respect. We see each other not as enemies, but as fellow human beings, each made in the image of God, each precious in his sight.
We leave no one behind. We believe everyone deserves a fair shot. We give hate no safe harbor. Together, we believe in America. That's my prayer: to remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there is nothing—and I mean this sincerely—nothing beyond our capacity if we act together.
We're the only Nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in when we act together.
My prayer for all of you—in my church, we've taken the 22d Psalm and turned it into a hymn. And it says: ""And he will raise you up on eagle's wings and bear you on the breath of dawn and make you to shine like the Sun. Until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of his hand.""
That's sincerely my prayer to all of you. We have really tough, tough differences. We really go at one another. But remember—let's remember who the hell we—hell we are. We're the United States of America. It's all about dignity and respect. So let's practice it.
Thank you for having me. It's good to be back.""	Remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast"

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 212(f) and section 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 8 U.S.C. 1185(a)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, find that the situation in the West Bank—in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction—has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region. These actions undermine the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution and ensuring Israelis and Palestinians can attain equal measures of security, prosperity, and freedom. They also undermine the security of Israel and have the potential to lead to broader regional destabilization across the Middle East, threatening United States personnel and interests. For these reasons, these actions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.
Accordingly, I hereby order:
Section 1. All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, including any foreign branch, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:
(a) any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:
(i) to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, any of the following:
(A) actions—including directing, enacting, implementing, enforcing, or failing to enforce policies—that threaten the peace, security, or stability of the West Bank; or
(B) planning, ordering, otherwise directing, or participating in any of the following actions affecting the West Bank:
(1) an act of violence or threat of violence targeting civilians;
(2) efforts to place civilians in reasonable fear of violence with the purpose or effect of necessitating a change of residence to avoid such violence;
(3) property destruction; or
(4) seizure or dispossession of property by private actors;
(ii) to be or have been a leader or official of:
(A) an entity, including any government entity, that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in, any of the activities described in subsections (a) or (b) of this section related to the leader's or official's tenure; or
(B) an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order as a result of activities relating to the leader's or official's tenure;
(iii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person blocked pursuant to this order; or
(iv) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person blocked pursuant to this order; or
(b) any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury:
(i) to have committed or have attempted to commit, to pose a significant risk of committing, or to have participated in training to commit acts of terrorism affecting the West Bank; or
(ii) to be a leader or official of an entity sanctioned pursuant to subsection (b)(i) of this section.
Sec. 2. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the date of this order.
Sec. 3. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include:
(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and
(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.
Sec. 4. (a) The unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of noncitizens determined to meet one or more of the criteria in section 1 of this order would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and the entry of such persons into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, is hereby suspended, except when the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, determines that the person's entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States, including when the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, as appropriate, so determines, based on a recommendation of the Attorney General, that the person's entry would further important United States law enforcement objectives.
(b) The Secretary of State shall implement this order as it applies to visas pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish.
(c) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this order as it applies to the entry of noncitizens pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may establish.
(d) Such persons shall be treated by this section in the same manner as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).
Sec. 5. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 6. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.
Sec. 7. For the purposes of this order:
(a) the term ""entity"" means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
(b) the term ""noncitizen"" means any person who is not a citizen or noncitizen national of the United States;
(c) the term ""person"" means an individual or entity;
(d) the term ""United States person"" means any United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and
(e) the term ""terrorism"" means an activity that:
(i) involves a violent act or an act dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; and
(ii) appears to be intended:
(A) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;
(B) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or
(C) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, kidnapping, or hostage-taking.
Sec. 8. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked or affected by this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds and other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to this order.
Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of these functions within the Department of the Treasury. All executive departments and agencies of the United States shall take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order.
Sec. 10. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government or the United Nations (including its specialized agencies, programs, funds, and related organizations) by employees, grantees, and contractors thereof.
Sec. 11. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to submit recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 12. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

"Feb 04, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-bipartisan-senate-agreement-for-national-security-legislation,Statement on the Bipartisan Senate Agreement for National Security Legislation,"""For too long, going back decades, the immigration system has been broken. It's time to fix it. That's why over 2 months ago I instructed members of my administration to work with a bipartisan group of Senators to—finally—seriously address the issue. And that's what they've done, working around the clock, through the holidays and over weekends. Now we've reached an agreement on a bipartisan national security deal that includes the toughest and fairest set of border reforms in decades. I strongly support it.
It will make our country safer, make our border more secure, treat people fairly and humanely while preserving legal immigration, consistent with our values as a nation. It would give me, as President, a new emergency authority to shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed. It will make our asylum process fairer and more efficient while protecting the most vulnerable. It will expedite work permits so that those who are here and qualify can get to work more quickly. It will create more opportunities for families to come together, through short-term visits as well as increased permanent lawful pathways. It ensures the most vulnerable, unaccompanied young children, have paid legal representation. And it will provide the resources I have repeatedly requested to secure the border by adding border patrol agents, immigration judges, asylum officers, and cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect and stop the flow of fentanyl. While this agreement doesn't address everything I would have wanted, these reforms are essential for making our border more orderly, secure, fair, and humane.
The bipartisan national security agreement would also address two other important priorities. It allows the United States to continue our vital work, together with partners all around the world, to stand up for Ukraine's freedom and support its ability to defend itself against Russia's aggression. As I have said before, if we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won't limit himself to just Ukraine and the costs for America will rise. This agreement also provides Israel what they need to protect their people and defend itself against Hamas terrorists. And it will provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people.
There is more work to be done to get it over the finish line. But I want to be clear about something: If you believe, as I do, that we must secure the border now, doing nothing is not an option. Working with my administration, the United States Senate has done the hard work it takes to reach a bipartisan agreement. Now House Republicans have to decide. Do they want to solve the problem? Or do they want to keep playing politics with the border?
I've made my decision. I'm ready to solve the problem. I'm ready to secure the border. And so are the American people. I know we have our divisions at home, but we cannot let partisan politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation. I refuse to let that happen. In moments like these, we have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.
I urge Congress to come together and swiftly pass this bipartisan agreement. Get it to my desk so I can sign it into law immediately."""
"Feb 06, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-emergency-national-security-supplemental-appropriations-and-exchange-with,Remarks on Emergency National Security Supplemental Appropriations and an Exchange With Reporters,"""The President. Good afternoon.
Q. Good afternoon, sir.
Q. Good afternoon. 
The President. For much too long, as you all know, the immigration system has been broken. And it's long past time to fix it.
That's why, months ago, I instructed my team to begin negotiations with a bipartisan group of Senators to seriously and finally fix our immigration system. For months now, that's what they've done, working around the clock, through the holidays, over the weekends. It's been an extraordinary effort by Senators Lankford, Murphy, and Sinema.
The result of all this hard work is a bipartisan agreement that represents the most fair, humane reforms in our immigration system in a long time and the toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever. Now all indications are, this bill won't even move forward to the Senate floor.
Why? A simple reason: Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump thinks it's bad for him politically. Therefore, he doesn't—even though it would help the country, he's not for it. He'd rather weaponize this issue than actually solve it.
So, for the last 24 hours, he's done nothing, I'm told, but reach out to Republicans in the House and the Senate and threaten them and try to intimidate them to vote against this proposal. And it looks like they're caving.
Frankly, they owe it to the American people to show some spine and do what they know to be right.
So I want to tell the American people what's in this bill and why everyone from the Wall Street Journal to the Border Patrol to the Chamber of Commerce—the United States Chamber of Commerce support this bill.
Because it's going to make the country safer, make the border more secure, treat people more humanely and freely—and fairly, and make legal immigration more efficient and consistent with the values of our Nation and our international treaty obligations.
It would finally provide the funding that I have repeatedly—repeatedly—requested, most recently in October, to actually secure the border. That includes an additional 1,500 border agents and officers to secure the border—to physically secure it.
In addition, 100 cutting-edge machines to detect and stop fentanyl at the southwest border. We have that capacity.
An additional—100 additional immigration judges to help reduce the year-long asylum backlog. You show up for asylum and you get told a judge is supposed to talk to you. It takes a year to get that discussion going.
This bill would also establish new, efficient, and fair process for the Government to consider an asylum claim for those arriving at the border.
Today the process can take 5 to 7 years, as you all know. They show up at the border, get a bracelet, told to be—come back when called, 5 to 7 years from now, in country. That's too long, and it's not rational.
With the new policies in this bill and the additional of 4,300 more asylum officers—who spend hours, I might add, with each immigrant to consider their claims, whether they qualify—we'll be able to reduce that process to 6 months, not 5 to 7 years.
This bipartisan bill will also expedite work permits so those who are here and who qualify can begin work more quickly. That's something that our Governors, our mayors, and our business leaders have been asking me for and asking them for. All across the country, they've been asking for this.
It will also create more opportunities for families to come together, for business to hire additional workers. And for the first time in 30 years—the first time in 30 years, this bipartisan legislation increases the number of immigrant visas for people legally—legally—able to come to this country through ports of entry.
And it ensures that—for the first time, that vulnerable, unaccompanied young children have legal representation at the border.
This bill would also give me, as President, the emergency authority to temporarily shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed—the numbers they're talking—over 5,000 people trying get in in 1 day.
The bill—if the bill were law today, it would qualify to be shut down right now while we repair it.
The bottom line is, this bipartisan bill is a win for America because it makes important fixes to our broken immigration system, and it's the toughest, fairest law that's ever been proposed relative to the border.
Now, it doesn't address everything I'd like—that I wanted.
For example, we still need a path for—of documentation for those who are already here. And we're not walking away from true immigration reform, including permanent protections and a pathway to citizenship for young ""Dreamers"" who came here when they were children and who have been good citizens and contribute so much to our country.
But the reforms in this bill are essential for making our border more orderly, more humane, and more secure.
That's why the Border Patrol union—which, by the way, endorsed Donald Trump in the 2020 election—endorses this bill. These are the people whose job it is to secure the border every single solitary day. They don't just show up for photo ops like some Members of Congress. They're there to do their job.
This is the risk—the thing they—many of them risk their lives doing every single day. And they decided—they decided—the Border Patrol decided this gives them the tools they need to do the job: more personnel across the board.
It's also why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce endorsed this bill, because they know this bill is not just good for the border, it's also good for American business and for the American economy.
And it's why the Wall Street Journal endorsed the bill with the headline this morning which reads, quote: ""A Border Security Bill Worth Passing. The Senate Has Reforms Trump Never Came Close to Getting."" That's the quote from the Journal.
This bill would also address two other important priorities. First, it provides urgent funding for Ukraine. I'm wearing my Ukraine tie and my Ukraine pin, which I've been wearing because they're in dire straits right now, defending themselves against the Russian onslaught and brutal conquest.
The clock is ticking. Every week, every month that passes without new aid to Ukraine means fewer artillery shells, fewer defense air—air defense systems, fewer tools for Ukraine to defend itself against this Russian onslaught. Just what Putin wants.
Ukrainians are fighting bravely. You know, you've—many of you—I look around the room here—have followed me in this for a long time. I pulled together a coalition of over 50 nations to support them. On the phone, talking to these leaders, I—we unified NATO. Remember when we first came into office, NATO was in—well, they're all together, and I actually increased the size of NATO.
We can't walk away now. That's what Putin is betting on. Supporting this bill is standing up to Putin. Opposing this bill is playing into his hands.
As I've said before, the stakes on this fight extend well beyond Ukraine. If we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won't limit himself to just Ukraine. And the costs for America and our allies and partners will rise.
For those Republicans in Congress who think they can oppose funding for Ukraine and not be held accountable, history is watching. History is watching. A failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten.
The position of the MAGA Republicans can be characterized by the New York Times headline: ""First""—and this is the headline. It reads: ""Trump First. Putin Second. America Third."" That cannot pertain.
This bipartisan agreement also provides Israel with what it needs to protect its people and defend itself against Hamas terrorists. And it will provide the necessary lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people. By opposing this bill, they're denying aid to the people who are really suffering and desperately need help.
You know, there's more work to get this done, over the finish line. And I want to be clear: Doing nothing is not an option.
Republicans have to decide. For years, they said they want to secure the border. Now they have the strongest border bill this country has ever seen. We're seeing statements about how many oppose the bill now.
Look, I understand the former President is desperately trying to stop this bill because it's not—he's not interested in solving the border problem; he wants a political issue to run against me on. They've all but said that, across the board. No one really denies that, that I'm aware of.
The American people want a solution that puts an end to the empty political rhetoric which has failed to do anything for so long. We have to get the resources to the border to get the job done.
So Republicans have to decide: Who do they serve, Donald Trump or the American people? Are they here to solve problems or just weaponize those problems for political purposes?
I know my answer. I serve the American people. I'm here to solve problems.
It was just months ago that Republicans were asking for this exact bill to deal with the border, to provide support for Ukraine and Israel. And now it's here, and they're saying: ""Never mind. Never mind.""
Folks, we've got to move past this toxic politics. And it's time to stop playing games with the world waiting and watching. And by the way, the world is waiting. The world is watching. They are waiting and watching what we're going to do.
We can't let—we can't continue to let petty partisan politics get in the way of our responsibility. We're a great nation that's not acting like a great nation.
So I'm calling on Congress to pass this bill and get it to my desk immediately. But if the bill fails, I want to be absolutely clear about something: The American people are going to know why it failed.
I'll be taking this issue to the country, and the voters are going to know that it's not just a moment—just at the moment we were going to secure the border and fund these other programs, Trump and the MAGA Republicans said no because they're afraid of Donald Trump—afraid of Donald Trump.
Every day between now and November, the American people are going to know that the only reason the border is not secure is Donald Trump and his MAGA Republican friends. It's time for Republicans in the Congress to show a little courage, to show a little spine, to make it clear to the American people that you work for them and not for anyone else.
I know who I work for. I work for the American people. In moments like this, we have to remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. You've heard me say it many times: There is nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. We're right on the verge of doing it together.
I hope—I hope and pray—they find reason to reconsider blowing this up.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Q. Mr.——
The President. Folks, you're going to ask me questions. Hang on a second. I'm going to be back on Thursday, and I don't want to prejudice what may be going on in negotiations now, so I'm not going to be answering any questions on this.
I'll be back Thursday to stand here with you and answer all the questions you want about this issue.
Thank you.
Q. Can we ask you about the hostage deal, sir?
Q. [Inaudible]—the cease-fire, Mr. President?
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]
Hostages Held in Gaza, Palestinian Territories/Israel/Ukraine 
Q. What needs to get done for the hostage deal to get resolved, sir?
The President. This indirectly has a lot to do with the hostage deal and what's going on in the Middle East—the decision on what we do relative to Israel, the decision what we do or in terms of American funding of whether we're going to engage with the situation in Ukraine. It all goes to the question of American power. It all goes to: Does America keep its word? Does America move forward?
There is some movement, and I don't want to—well, let me be—choose my words. There is some movement—there's been a response from the—there's been a response from the opposition, but it——
Q. Hamas?
The President. Yes, I'm sorry—from Hamas. But it seems to be a little over the top. We're not sure where it is.
There's a continuing negotiation right now.
U.S. Security Assistance 
Q. Would—Mr. President, if this bill fails, would you consider supporting something separate that just addresses Israel or Ukraine?
The President. I'm not going to concede that now. I—we need it all. The rest of the world is looking at us, and they really are.
Thank you.

Q. What reaction—[inaudible]—to the ruling that Donald Trump does not have immunity? Mr. President, your reaction to that ruling?""	Remarks on Emergency National Security Supplemental Appropriations and an Exchange With Reporters"
"Feb 08, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-department-justice-special-counsel-robert-k-hurs-report-the-presidents-handling,Remarks on Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert K. Hur's Report on the President's Handling of Classified Documents From His Tenure as Vice President and Senator and an Exchange With Reporters,"""The President. Hey, everybody.
Q. Good evening.
Q. Good evening, Mr. President.
The President. Let me say a few things before I take your questions.
As you know, the Special Counsel released its findings today about their look into my handling of classified documents. I was pleased to see he reached the firm conclusion that no charges should be brought against me in this case.
This was an exhaustive investigation going back more than 40 years, even into the 1970s, when I was still a new United States Senator.
And the Special Counsel acknowledged that I cooperated completely, I did not throw up any roadblocks, I sought no delays. In fact, I was so determined to give the Special Counsel what he needed, I went forward with a 5-hour in-person—5-hour in-person interview over 2 days on October the 8th and 9th of last year, even though Israel had just been attacked by Hamas on the 7th and I was very occupied. It was in the middle of handling an international crisis.
I was especially pleased to see Special Counsel make clear the stark distinction and difference between this case and Mr. Trump's case. The Special Counsel wrote, and I quote, ""Several material distinctions between Mr. Trump's case and Mr. Biden's are clear.""
Continuing to quote: ""Most notably, after given multiple chances to return classified documents to avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it.""
""In contrast,"" it went on to say, ""Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice; consented to the search of multiple locations, including his home; sat for a voluntary interview; and in other ways cooperated with the investigation,"" end of quote.
I've seen the headlines since the report was released about my willful retention of documents. This—these assertions are not only misleading, they're just plain wrong. On page 215, if you had a chance—I know it's a long—it's a thick document. On page 215, the report of the Special Counsel found the exact opposite. Here's what he wrote: ""There is, in fact, a shortage of evidence"" that I willfully retained classified materials related to Afghanistan.
On page 12, the Special Counsel also wrote for another documents, ""The decision to decline criminal charges was straightforward . . . the evidence suggests that Mr. Biden did not willfully retain these documents."" The evidence said I did not willfully retain these documents.
In addition, I know there's some attention paid to some language in the report about my recollection of events. There's even a reference that I don't remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that. Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself, it wasn't any of their damn business.
Let me tell you something. Some of you have commented—I wear, since the day he died, every single day, the rosary he got from our Lady of—every Memorial Day, we hold a service remembering him, attended by friends and family and the people who loved him. I don't need anyone—I don't need anyone—to remind me when he passed away or if he passed away.
The simple truth is, I sat for a 5-hour interview, over 2 days, of events going back 40 years. At the same time, I was managing an international crisis.
Their task was to make a decision about whether to move forward with charges in this case. That was their decision to make. That's the Counsel's decision to make. That's his job. And they decided not to move forward.
For any extraneous commentary, they don't know what they're talking about. It has no place in this report.
The bottom line is: The matter is now closed. And we can continue what I have always focused on: my job of being President of the United States of America.
I thank you, and I'll take some questions.
Comments on the President's Age and Memory Contained in the Special Counsel's Report 
Q. President Biden, something the Special Counsel said in his report is that one of the reasons you were not charged is because, in his description, you are a ""well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""
The President. I am well meaning, and I'm an elderly man, and I know what the hell I'm doing. I've been President. I put this country back on its feet. I don't need his recommendation. That's totally out——
Q. How bad is your memory? And can you continue as President?
The President. My memory is so bad, I let you speak. [Laughter] That's the——
Q. Do you——
The President. That's what——
The President's Memory 
Q. Do you feel your memory has gotten worse, Mr. President?
The President. No, look, my memory has not gotten—my memory is fine. My memory—take a look at what I've done since I've become President. None of you thought I could pass any of the things I got passed. How did that happen?
You know, I guess I just forgot what was going on.
Q. Mr. President—Mr. President——
The President's Age 
Q. Should voters have concerns about your age? How are you going to assuage them? And do you fear that this report is only going to fuel further concerns about your age—[inaudible]?
The President. Only by some of you.
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]
Q. Mr. President——
The President's Prior Handling of Classified Information
Q. Mr. President, you were—Mr. President, you were cleared of criminal liability today, but do you take responsibility for at least being careless with classified material?
The President. I take responsibility for not having seen exactly what my staff was doing. That—goes in and points out things that appeared in my garage, things that came out of my home, things that were moved were moved not by me, but my staff—but my staff. And——
[Several reporters asked questions at once.]
Q. Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?
Public Perception of the President's Age 
Q. Mr. President, for months when you were asked about your age, you would respond with the words ""Watch me.""
The President. Watch me.
Q. Many American people have been watching, and they have expressed concerns about your age. They——
The President. That is your judgment.
Q. They——
The President. That is your judgment.
Q. This is according to public polling.
The President. That is not the judgment——
Q. They express concerns——
The President. ——of the press.
2024 Presidential Election 
Q. They express concerns about your mental acuity. They say that you are too old.
Mr. President, in December, you told me that you believe there are many other Democrats who could defeat Donald Trump. So why does it have to be you now? Why—what is your answer to that question?
The President. Because I'm the most qualified person in this country to be President of the United States and finish the job I started.
[Several reporters asked questions at once.]
Q. Do you believe that——
Q. Mr. President, why are you confusing the names of world leaders?
The President's Prior Handling of Classified Information 
Q. Mr. President, why did you share classified information with your ghostwriter?
The President. I did not share classified information. I did not share it.
Q. With your ghostwriter?
The President. With my ghostwriter, I did not. Guarantee you, I did not. What the——
Q. But the Special Counsel said that——
The President. Well, no, they did not say that.
Q. Okay, okay.
The President. He did not say that.
Q. But, Mr. President——
The President. No, let—let me answer your question. The fact of the matter is, what I didn't want repeated—I didn't want him to know, and I didn't read it to him—was I had written a long memorandum to President Obama why we should not be in this—in Afghanistan. And I was of the—multiple pages.
And so what I was referring to—I said ""classified""—I should have said it was—should be private because it was a contact between the President and the Vice President as to what was going on. That's what he was referring to. It was not classified information in that document. That was not classified.
[Several reporters asked questions at once.]
Q. Mr. President——
The President's Prior Handling of Classified Information 
Q. I—okay, all right. He called on me.
When you look back at this incident, is there anything you would do differently now? And do you think that a Special Prosecutor should have been appointed in the first place in both of these cases?
The President. First of all, what I would have done is oversee the transfer of the material that was in my office—in my offices. I should have done that. If I had to go back—and I didn't have the responsibility to do that. That was—my staff was supposed to do that, and they referenced that in the report.
And my staff did not do it in the way that—for example, I didn't know how half the boxes got in my garage until I found out staff gathered them up, put them together, and took them to the garage in my home. And all the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked. It was in my house. It wasn't out in—like in Mar-a-Lago, in a public place where—and none of it was high classified. Didn't have any of that red stuff on it—you know what I mean?—around the corners. None of that.
And so I wish I had paid more attention to how the documents were being moved and where. I thought they were being moved to the Archives. I thought all of it was being moved. That's what I thought.
Now, what was the last part of your question?
Appointment of a Special Counsel To Investigate the President's Prior Handling of Classified Information 
Q. Whether a Special Counselor should have been appointed in this case and in the case of your rival, President—former President Trump.
The President. I think a Special Counsel should have been appointed. And the reason I think a Special Counsel should have been appointed is because I did not want to be in a position that they looked at Trump and weren't going to look at me, just like they looked at the Vice President.
And the fact is they made a firm conclusion: I did not break the law. Period.
Thank you all very, very much. Thank you. Thank you.
[The President left the podium and began to exit the room as several reporters shouted questions at once.]
Hostages Held by Hamas in Gaza, Palestinian Territories/Status of Hostage Release Negotiations/Israeli Military Operations in Gaza/International Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. A question on Israel, sir——
Q. Can you provide an update on the hostage negotiations?
Q. On Israel, sir——
Q. The hostage negotiations—can you provide an update of the hostage negotiations in Israel?
Q. ——Netanyahu says that he has ordered an IDF——
The President. The hostage negotiation, look——
[The President returned to the podium and spoke as follows.]
I'm of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in Gaza—in the Gaza Strip has been over the top. I think that—as you know, initially, the President of Mexico [Egypt; White House correction], Elsisi, did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in. I talked to him. I convinced him to open the gate.
I talked to Bibi to open the gate on the Israeli side. I've been pushing really hard—really hard—to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza. There are a lot of innocent people who are starving, a lot of innocent people who are in trouble and dying, and it's got to stop, number one.
Number two, I was also in the position that I'm the guy that made the case that we have to do much more to increase the amount of material going in, including fuel, including other items. I've been on the phone with the Qataris, I've been on the phone with the Egyptians, I've been on the phone with the Saudis to get as much aid as we possibly can into Gaza.
There are innocent people—and innocent women and children—who are also in bad—badly in need of help. And so that's what we're pushing right now.
And I'm pushing very hard now to deal with this hostage cease-fire. Because, as I—you know, I've been working tirelessly in this deal—how can I say this without revealing?—to lead to a sustained pause in the fighting in—the actions taking place in the Gaza Strip.
And—because I think if we can get the delay for that—the initial delay, I think that we would be able to extend that so that we can increase the prospect that this fighting in Gaza changes.
There's also negotiations—you may recall, in the very beginning, right after—right before Hamas attacked, I was in contact with the Saudis and others to work out a deal where they would recognize Israel's right to exist, let them—make them part of the Middle East, recognize them fully, in return for certain things that the United States would commit to do.
And the commitment to—that we were proposing to do related to two items. I'm not going to go in detail. But one of them was to deal with the protection against their archenemy to the northwest—northeast, I should say. The second one, by providing ammunition and materiel for them to defend themselves.
Coincidentally, that's the timeframe when this broke out. I have no proof for what I'm about to say, but it's not unreasonable to suspect that the—Hamas understood what was about to take place and wanted to break it up before it happened.
Thank you.

Let me say a few things before I get started with our discussion.
Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert K. Hur's Report on the President's Handling of Classified Documents From His Tenure as Vice President and Senator 
First—I'm not going to be very long, I promise. First, the Special Counsel released their findings today about their look into my handling of classified documents. I was pleased to see they reached a conclusion I believed and knew all along they would: that there are—no charges should be brought in this case.
As many of you know, this was an exhaustive investigation going back literally more than 40 years—40 years—when I became a United States Senator when I was a kid. [Laughter] I was a kid, 29 years old. [Laughter]
Special Counsel acknowledged I cooperated completely, I did not throw up any roadblocks, I sought no delays. In fact, I was so determined to give Special Counsel what they needed, I went forward with a 5-hour in-person interview over the 2 days of October the 9th—8th and 9th last year, even though Israel had just been attacked by Hamas on the 7th. I was in the middle of handling an international crisis.
But I was especially pleased to see the Special Counsel make clear the stark differences between this case and Donald Trump. As the Special Counsel wrote, and I quote, ""Several material distinctions between Mr. Trump's case and Mr. Biden's are clear."" And by the way, this is a Republican Counsel. ""Most notably, after given multiple chances""—this is a continuation of the quote—""he returned classified documents and avoided—to avoid—and avoided prosecution. Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite.""
This is to—continuing to quote: ""According to the indictment, he has not only refused to return documents for many months, he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then lie about it. In contrast, Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives, the Department of Justice; consented to a search of multiple locations, including his homes; and sat for a voluntary interview; and in other ways cooperated with the investigation."" That's the distinction, among others.
The bottom line is, the Special Counsel, in my case, decided against moving forward with any charges, and this matter is now closed. I'll continue to do what I've always done: stay focused on my job, like you do—of my job of being President.
House Democratic Issues Conference 
That means going to work with all of you every single day I can. Thank you for being great partners. Just this week, House Democrats showed how united you are. You defeated Mayorkas impeachment resolution. You—and I had no doubt he'd get out of his hospital bed and come in and vote. No, I'm not joking. I talked to him a little bit. Not—I mean after, not before. [Laughter]
You defeated the Israel-only—the Israeli-only supplemental. They weren't easy votes for you, but all of you all came through in a big way. All of this just shows that when we're united, we can beat House Republicans and their cynical political games.
And you've been incredible partners that have delivered historic results for the American people. I've traveled to many of your districts. I see the results on how you came through one of the toughest periods in our Nation's history. Hakeem just mentioned many of those accomplishments: vaccinating America, rebuilding America, bringing prices down, and delivering every day for everyday Americans.
A recent Washington Post headline—never thought I'd see this for a Democrat—says, ""Falling Inflation and Rising Growth Give United States the World's Best Recovery,"" end of quote. Because of you. No, I mean it. I may have some good ideas, but you got it done.
But I'd like to use my time to talk about the future—you know, what it means to finish the job in my perspective—from my perspective.
We've made progress making the biggest corporations begin to pay—only begin to pay their fair share. We got—we were able to keep everything in place when the Republicans kept changing the deals we made about spending and the like, right? Remember those days?
Well, with a minimum—remember those 50 corporations that didn't pay a penny in taxes, made $40 billion? Well, guess what? They're paying a corporate tax of 15 percent. And we're able to keep everything paid for, and we still cut the deficit. We helped pay for historic investments and reduced the Federal deficit. But we're not done.
Trump's $2 trillion tax cut overwhelming benefited the superwealthy and biggest corporations and exploded the deficit. And it's coming up pretty soon for a decision of what we're going to do. He's already said he wants to not only keep it, but increase it.
Finishing the job means getting the Trump tax cut closed—gutting the Trump tax cuts, closing the loophole for billionaire minimum tax. You know, we went from 750 billionaires in America before the pandemic to 1,000 now. You know what the average tax they pay is—in Federal tax? Eight-point-three percent. Billionaire—those thousand—8.3 percent. That's less than a teacher or a firefighter, and I could go down the list.
I promised a billionaire minimum tax of 25 percent. If we did that, it would raise $440 billion. Twenty five percent. Four hundred and forty billion dollars to pay for childcare, eldercare, and so much more, and reduce the deficit.
You know, we're also planning for a long-term effort to—I think we have to deal with the tax structure in a way. I mean, I—no matter where I go, whether I was speaking at the Business Roundtable—whoever I'm speaking to, I say, ""Raise your hand if you think the present tax system is fair."" No, I'm not joking—think about in—in practical terms. Is it fair? Is it remotely fair?
""Finish the job"" means beating Big Pharma again to lower prescription costs for everybody. And by the way, you know, when my Republican friends were taking us on on that, what—it not only lowers—you talked about dealing with insulin: 35 bucks a month. Saved the individual a lot of money. But guess what? It saves the taxpayers $160 billion, reduced the debt by $160 billion, what we did—what you all did to Pharma. I mean it.
I mean, we—the things we're doing not only help people, but they're reducing the deficit and good economic policy because Medicare doesn't have to pay those exorbitant prices.
We've got to finish the job, meaning it's $35 insulin not just for the—on Medicare, but like we originally had and they wouldn't continue it: $35 insulin for everybody—everybody, all Americans.
Lower drug prices for dozens of other prescriptions—we got that into the law. It's coming up. And getting even more Americans health insurance by protecting and expanding the Affordable Health Care Act. You guys have done this.
We've got to—""finish the job"" means making housing more affordable, more accessible. It means protecting and strengthening the Social Security system and Medicare.
Republicans want to put it on the chopping block. Remember the last State of the Union, when I—we talked about what their——
Participant. Yes.
The President. Bless me, Father. [Laughter]
And ""finishing the job"" means protecting fundamental freedoms: passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act finally and making Roe v. Ward [Wade; White House correction] the law of the land—the law of the land.
It means beating the NRA again, banning assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, which we did before.
""Finish the job"" means continuing our fight to save the planet with the most aggressive action on climate ever in the history of the America—of the world.
With every new bridge, every new factory, every new high-speed rail, internet, with every poisonous lead pipe removed, I see something else happening now and in the future: Pride is returning.
When I said—when I—we pushed all these programs, I said I'm going to be a President for everybody, whether you live in a red State or a green [blue; White House correction] State. I know it drives some of you crazy that we—a lot of these things are happening in red States, but the Americans need help.
You know, some of your more interesting colleagues go out and hold press conferences of the things they said was a ""disaster"" and was ""almost immoral."" What's that blonde-haired woman's name? Anyway. [Laughter] She's talking about all that's going in her district. [Laughter] Oh, God. Anyway. [Laughter]
Look, what happened with a lot of people—and particularly in the near-Midwest, in the Midwest, in the Northwest—is that, you know, for years and years you could go by the factory that employed 800, 1,000, 1,200 people—Mom had worked there, Dad had worked there, Grandpop, Grandma—and they had pride in what they did.
And, all of a sudden, corporate America decided—and it really did over the last 10 years— decided, ""You know, I'd rather take my factory, move it overseas because the labor is cheaper, and then import the product."" Well, not anymore. Not anymore.
Guess what, folks? There's a provision in the law that says—that I didn't even know it existed until I—about 8 years ago—and that is when—they had legislation in the thirties dealing with the issue of whether or not labor unions had a right to organize, what protections they had, et cetera.
There was a provision in the law that even Democratic Presidents didn't either know about or pay much attention to. It said any money you appropriate—that Congress appropriates and it goes to the President of the United States for a public purpose, that President should hire an American worker and American companies to do it. [Applause] Really.
Well, we're investing in America. That's what you're doing. We're investing in America. We're bringing back pride to communities, pride in our country.
And so I want to thank you for doing the job you were elected to do. It matters to the American people, and it's—we're in a position to win in 2024, I think.
That brings me to the second point. We have to make the contrast, the choice crystal clear— through [though; White House correction] our friends on the other side make it easy for us. Time and again, Republicans show they're a party of chaos and disunion. This is not your father's Republican Party. They shout about a problem, but then do nothing to solve the problem.
The bottom line is, Republicans have to decide: Who do they serve? This is—I'm not—this is not hyperbole. Who do they serve: Donald Trump or the American people?
You have worked so hard—a bipartisan group—so hard for so long to deal with the border and all the other issues we have in that appropriation. And guess what? Donald Trump allegedly—I can't prove this; I'm told—called people and said, ""If you support that, I'm coming after you."" Not his—not—I don't know what the exact words were, but ""I'm coming after you.""
Are they here to solve a problem or just to weaponize for political attacks those problems?
I know our answer. We're here to serve the American people. That's not—it's not like we— we're here, we're Democrats, we all—that's the job: serve the American people. We have to make that clear. If we do, we win.
Just look at 2020. We weren't supposed to do well. Remember? We won in spite of a lot— [inaudible]—2022: The red wave was coming. And guess what? It crashed up on a rock. [Laughter] In 2023, every close race, we won.
When voters have a choice between what we stand for and what Trump and the MAGA Republicans stand for, we win. Which makes Trump and his MAGA friends losers. [Laughter]
When we win, we have to do it the old-fashioned politics way. We have to get out the vote— an aggressive grassroot operation to get folks registered and get out the vote.
And here's the final point I want to make. I can't take anything for granted—we can't. In 2020, we ran—I ran because I thought everything this country stood for, everything we believed in, everything that made America ""America"" was at risk. And I believed that, and I spoke to that.
And I was—I think people thought I was being hyperbolic at the time. ""Joe, what do you mean our democracy is at risk?"" Seriously. Remember, I made that—you may not, but I made a speech at Independence Hall in the beginning. [Laughter] ""What do you mean we're in a battle for the soul of America?""
Well, people don't say that anymore. They know the stakes are higher than ever.
We've made more progress in 3 years, because of you, than most Presidents have in 8 years. But it can all be wiped out in this election. So we have to stay focused on what we have to do.
We must—we must—keep the White House. We must keep the Senate. And we must take back the House—with all of you sworn in again and Hakeem Jeffries your Speaker of the House. And when we do that, we'll be able to look back and say something few generations can say: The American democracy was at risk, and you saved it.
Look, we just have to remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America. I mean it. There is nothing beyond our capacity when we work together.
So God bless you all. And thank you for all you do.
Thank you, thank you, thank you."""

And you know, it was about 2 years ago, you and I met here, and you said the United States and Germany have to act together and do what's necessary together. And we've been doing that. We've got to continue to do it.
And you know, Congress—we have to pass a national security spending package now. Our House Members are being somewhat reluctant—and hopefully, it's more politics than real, but—including funding for Ukraine and to help them continue to be able to defend themselves against the brutal aggression of Russia.
But I want to thank you, Olaf, for your leadership from the very beginning. And you've done something no one thought could get done: You've doubled Germany's military aid to Ukraine this year. And it's really important. We've got to step up and do our part now.
Today we'll also discuss the work to—just that we're going to be doing together to strengthen NATO ahead of the 75th NATO summit this summer here. So you've got to come back.
And also, the latest developments in the Middle East, including hostage release—we have negotiations going on; increase in lifesaving humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza—in the Gaza Strip; and preserve the space for an enduring peace for a two-state solution down the road. I think it's possible. It's going to take a lot of work, but I think we can do it.
So, Olaf, thank you very, very much for being here. We've got a lot to talk about.
And the floor is yours, man.
Chancellor Scholz. Yes, thank you for having me and for having the chance to continue our conversations we have continuously all the time.
And yes, Germany and the United States have to play a role to keep peace in the world. This is especially so looking at the Russian aggression against Ukraine, which is still ongoing. And when we saw this ridiculous interview Putin gave shortly, we understand that he is always telling a lot of lies about the history of this war, because it's so easy to understand why he's doing it. He wants to get the part of the territory of its neighbors.
Just imperialist—imperialism. And I think it is necessary that we do all our best to support Ukraine and to give them the chance to defend their country. And so I'm very happy that in Europe we've made, now, decisions to give the necessary financial support to the budget, also that Germany was ready to increase its support with weapon delivery.
And hopefully, the——
[At this point, President Biden crossed his fingers.]
——Congress will—the House will follow you and make a decision on giving the necessary support, because without the support of United States and without the support of the European states, Ukraine will have not a chance to defend its own country.
I really think that it's very good that we are working together looking at the situation in the Middle East and especially working on the two-state solution, which is necessary for a lasting peace. And I'm sure that the United States and Germany are aligned intensely.
President Biden. We are. We are.
But I—especially want to—I'd like to add another point: The failure of the United States Congress, if it occurs, not to support Ukraine is close to criminal neglect. It is outrageous.
Kissinger was right when he said: Not since Napoleon has Europe not looked over its shoulder and worried about Russia—until now.
You and I helped put NATO together in a way it hadn't been a long time. So much is at stake, so they'd better step up.
Thank you all very much.

"Feb 12, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-meeting-with-king-abdullah-ii-jordan-1,Remarks Following a Meeting With King Abdullah II of Jordan,"""President Biden. Good afternoon.
Q. Good afternoon.
President Biden. Let me start by welcoming His Majesty, the King of Jordan. He's been a good friend. Abdullah, welcome back to the White House, man. Welcome back. And by the way, Barack is looking at you in the corner over there. [Laughter]
And along with Queen Riana [Rania; White House correction], who is meeting with Jill now, and the Queen—and the Crown Prince Hussein. Where—is the Prince out here? I thought he was coming out. Any rate.
We've known each other for many years. And His Majesty has been a good friend all those years, a steadfast partner alongside the Queen, and a beloved leader to their people. The partnership between the United States and our ally Jordan is strong, and it is enduring.
Today the King and I discussed with our senior foreign policy staffs what—the issue that's front and center in the Middle East and well beyond: the war between Israel and the terrorist organization Hamas. Over 4 months ago, on October the 7th, Hamas attacked Israel in an act of sheer evil, massacring more than 1,200 innocent women, men, and children, the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.
More than 250 hostages were taken. A hundred and thirty-four are still being held hostage by Hamas. We don't know how many are still alive. The anguish that their families are enduring week after week, month after month is unimaginable. And it's a top priority for the United States to bring them home.
I've made clear the United States shares the goal of seeing Hamas defeated and ensuring long-term security for Israel and its people.
After October 7 attacks, Hamas retreated back into Gaza, where its leaders live in underground tunnels, stretching for over a hundred miles beneath civilian infrastructure, including—including—schools, playgrounds, and neighborhoods.
The past 4 months, as the war has raged, the Palestinian people have also suffered unimaginable pain and loss. Too many—too many—of the over 27,000 Palestinians killed in this conflict have been innocent civilians and children, including thousands of children. And hundreds of thousands have no access to food, water, or other basic services.
Many families have lost not just one, but many relatives and cannot mourn for them or even bury them because it's not safe to do so. It's heartbreaking. Every innocent life [lost; White House correction] in Gaza is a tragedy, just as every innocent life lost in Israel is a tragedy as well. We pray for those lives taken—both Israeli and Palestinian—and for the grieving families left behind.
Not only do we pray for peace, we are actively working for peace, security, and dignity for both the Palestinian people and the Israeli people. And I'm working on this day and night with the King and others in the region to find the means to bring all these hostages home, to ease the humanitarian crisis, and to end the terror threat and to bring peace to Gaza and Israel, an enduring peace with a two-state solution for two peoples.
As the King and I discussed today, the United States is working on a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, which would bring immediate and sustained period of calm into Gaza for at least 6 weeks, which we could then take the time to build something more enduring.
Over the past month, I've had calls with Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as the leaders of Egypt and Qatar, to push this forward. The key element of the deals are on the table. There are gaps that remain, but I've encouraged Israeli leaders to keep working to achieve the deal. The United States will do everything possible to make it happen.
The King and I also discussed the situation in Rafah. As I said yesterday, our military operation in Rafah—their—the major military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible plan—a credible plan—for ensuring the safety and support of more than 1 million people sheltering there. Many people there have been displaced—displaced multiple times—fleeing the violence to the north, and now they're packed into Rafah, exposed and vulnerable. They need to be protected.
And we have also been clear from the start: We oppose any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.
Today the King and I also discussed in detail how to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza. From the very beginning, my team and I have relentlessly worked to get more aid in. I urged Congress for months to make sure that our Nation's support for Israel and—also includes urgently needed aid for Palestinians. And I've spoken repeatedly with partners across the region, including the King, to help facilitate the flow of such aid into Gaza as much as possible and that will actually get to the people that there—that are—need it.
We worked to get the Rafah crossing open. We worked to get Kerem Shalom open. And we insist that we remain—it remain open—both remain open. We're working to open other routes as well. And we're also working relentlessly to make sure aid workers can get the aid where it's needed once it gets through.
I want to recognize Jordan and the King specifically for all he has done to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza, including just a few days ago. He personally got in a plane and helped conduct an air drop of urgently needed medical supplies into Gaza.
I understand that two of his children have also joined those air drops. They helped fly humanitarian supplies in. And for years, the Queen has been passionate—a passionate advocate for the Palestinian people, particularly women and children. Your family's leadership, Your Majesty, and humanitarian commitment are commendable.
And at the same time, we're working to create the conditions for a lasting peace, as we talked a lot about upstairs, with the Israeli security guaranteed and Palestinian aspirations for their own state fulfilled. I say this as a long—lifelong supporter of Israel. That's the only path that guarantees Israel's security for the long term. To achieve it, the Palestinians must also seize the opportunity.
As I discussed with the King today, the Palestinian Authority must urgently reform so it can effectively deliver for the Palestinian people in both the West Bank and Gaza. Once Hamas's control of Gaza is over, they must prepare to build a state that accepts peace, does not harbor terrorist groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
And together, we will keep working to complete what has—what we started: to integrate the region, to bring about peace between Israel and all its Arab neighbors, including a Palestinian state. That effort was already underway before the October 7 attacks. It's even more urgent today.
No one—no one—understands better than our allies and partners in the region, including the King, what we need. I'm grateful to him for his friendship, including his and Jordan's unique role—unique role: custodian of the holy sites in Jerusalem.
We're grateful for this friendship. We saw that again just 2 weeks ago when three brave American servicemembers were killed in an attack at a military outpost in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, by radical militant groups backed by Iran, operating in Syria and Iraq. Since then, U.S. military forces have struck targets in Iraq and Syria, and our response will continue.
We're grateful for our partners and allies like the King who work with us every single day to advance security and stability across the region and beyond. It's difficult times like these when the bonds between nations are more important than ever.
And Jill and I are pleased to welcome him and the Queen and the Crown Prince to the White House today.
Your Majesty, over to you.
King Abdullah. Thank you, sir.
[At this point, President Biden moved from one side of the podium to the other.]
Mr.——
President Biden. I switched sides on you.
King Abdullah. Sorry. [Laughter]
Mr. President, thank you for your gracious hospitality accorded to me and my delegation today. My visit today carries an added meaning as our countries this year mark 75 years of exemplary strategic partnership. However, we had hoped we would be marking this major milestone during better circumstances in my region and the world.
Unfortunately, one of the most devastating wars in recent history continues to unfold in Gaza as we speak. Nearly 100,000 people have been killed, injured, or are missing. The majority are women and children.
We cannot afford an Israeli attack on Rafah. It is certain to produce another humanitarian catastrophe. The situation is already unbearable for over a million people who have been pushed into Rafah since the war started.
We cannot stand by and let this continue. We need a lasting cease-fire now. This war must end. We must urgently and immediately work to ensure the sustainable delivery of sufficient aid to Gaza through all possible entry points and mechanisms. And I thank you, Mr. President, for your support on this.
Restrictions on vital relief aid and medical items are leading to inhumane conditions. No other U.N. agency can do what UNRWA is doing in helping the people of Gaza through this humanitarian catastrophe.
Its work in other areas of operation—especially in Jordan, where 2.3 million are registered—is also vital. It is imperative that UNRWA continues to receive the support it needs to carry out its mandate.
The potential threat of Palestinian displacement beyond the borders of Gaza and the West Bank is something we view with extreme concern and cannot be allowed.
At the same time, we must ignore—we must not ignore the situation in the West Bank and in the holy sites in Jerusalem. Nearly 400 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October 7, including almost 100 children, and over 4,000 injured.
Continued escalations by extremist settlers in the West Bank and Jerusalem's holy sites and the expansion of illegal settlements will unleash chaos on the entire region.
The vast majority of Muslim worshippers are not being allowed to enter Al-Aqsa Mosque. Christian churches have also voiced concerns about increasing and unprecedented restrictions and threats.
It is also important to stress that the separation of the West Bank and Gaza cannot be accepted. Seven decades of occupation, death, and destruction have proven beyond any doubt that there can be no peace without a political horizon.
Military and security solutions are not the answer. They can never bring peace. Civilians on both sides continue to pay for this protracted conflict with their lives.
All attacks against innocent civilians—women and children—including those of October 7, cannot be accepted by any Muslim, as I have previously stressed. We must make sure the horrors of the past few months since October 7 are never repeated nor accepted by any human being.
We must together, along with Arab partners and the international community, step up efforts to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and immediately start working to create a political horizon that leads to a just and comprehensive peace on the basis of the two-state solution: an independent, sovereign, and viable Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital but living side by side with Israel in peace and security. This is the only solution that will guarantee peace and security for the Palestinians and the Israelis, as well as the entire region.
Your leadership, my dear friend, Mr. President, is key to addressing this conflict. And Jordan is ready to work, as always, with you towards peace.
Thank you.
President Biden. Thank you.

"Feb 13, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-senate-passage-emergency-national-security-supplemental-appropriations,Statement on Senate Passage of Emergency National Security Supplemental Appropriations Legislation,"""This bipartisan supplemental agreement is critical to advancing America's national security interests. It will allow the United States to continue our vital work, together with our allies and partners all around the world, to stand up for Ukraine's freedom and support its ability to defend itself against Russia's aggression. It will provide Israel with what it needs to protect its people against Hamas terrorists. Significantly, this agreement will provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people, the vast majority of whom have nothing to do with Hamas.
I applaud the bipartisan coalition of Senators who came together to advance this agreement, and I urge the House to move on this with urgency. We cannot afford to wait any longer. The costs of inaction are rising every day, especially in Ukraine. Already, we are seeing reports of Ukrainian troops running out of ammunition on the front lines as Russian forces continue to attack and Putin continues to dream of subjugating the Ukrainian people. There are those who say American leadership and our alliances and partnerships with countries around the world do not matter. They do. If we do not stand against tyrants who seek to conquer or carve up their neighbors' territory, the consequences for America's national security will be significant. Our allies and adversaries alike will take note. It is time for the House to take action and send this bipartisan legislation to my desk immediately so that I can sign it into law.""

Q. Good afternoon.
The President. Before we begin, I'm going to make this statement and let it stand on its own. I'm not going to take any questions, but I'll be taking questions tomorrow or the next day. But I don't want anything to get in the way of this statement, to be very blunt about it. Not that you wouldn't just focus on the statement.
Earlier this morning, the United States Senate, as you all know, voted overwhelmingly, by a margin of 70 to 29, to move forward with a bipartisan national security bill.
Now—now it moves to the House, and I urge Speaker Johnson to bring it to the floor immediately—immediately.
There is no question that if the Senate bill was put on the floor in the House of Representatives, it would pass. It would pass. And the Speaker knows that.
So I call on the Speaker to let the full House speak its mind and not allow a minority of the most extreme voices in the House to block this bill even from being voted on—even from being voted on. This is a critical act for the House to move. It needs to move.
And the bill provides urgent funding for Ukraine so it can keep defending itself against Putin's vicious, vicious onslaught. We've all seen the terrible stories in recent weeks: Ukrainian soldiers out of artillery shells, Ukrainian units rationing rounds of ammunition to defend themselves, Ukrainian families worried that the next Russian strike will permanently plunge them into darkness or worse.
This bipartisan bill sends a clear message to Ukrainians and to our partners and to our allies around the world: America can be trusted, America can be relied upon, and America stands up for freedom. We stand strong for our allies. We never bow down to anyone, and certainly not to Vladimir Putin. So let's get on with this.
Remember, the United States pulled together a coalition of nearly 50 nations to support Ukraine. We unified NATO; we expanded it. We can't walk away now. That's what Putin is betting on. He's—he just flatly said that.
Supporting this bill is standing up to Putin. Opposing it is playing into Putin's hands.
As I have said before, the stakes in this fight extend far beyond Ukraine. If we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won't limit himself just to Ukraine and the costs for America and our allies and partners is going to rise.
For Republicans in Congress who think they can oppose funding for Ukraine and not be held accountable: History is watching. History is watching. History is watching. Failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten.
I want to be clear about something, because I know it's important to the American people: While this bill sends military equipment to Ukraine, it spends the money right here in the United States of America in places like Arizona, where the Patriot missiles are built; and Alabama, where the Javelin missiles are built; and Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas, where artillery shells are made.
And the way it works is, we supply Ukraine with military equipment from our stockpiles, and then we spend our money replenishing those stockpiles so our military has access to them, stockpiles that are made right here in America by American workers. That not only supports American jobs and American communities, it allows us to invest in maintaining and strengthening our own defense manufacturing capacity.
Look, this bill meets our national security priorities in the Middle East as well. It includes greater support for our troops serving in the region who continue to defend against militia attacks backed by Iran.
It also provides Israel with the—what it needs to protect its people against a terrorist group like Hamas and Hizballah and others. And it will provide lifesaving humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people, who desperately need food, water, and shelter. They need help.
And finally, this bill includes critical funding for our national security priorities in Asia, because even as we focus on the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, we must not take our eye off our national security challenges in the Pacific.
It's the responsibility of a great nation. And we are a great nation that the rest of the world looks to. And I mean that: The rest of the world looks to us.
The stakes were already high for American security before this bill was passed in the Senate last night. But in recent days, those stakes have risen. And that's because the former President has set a dangerous and shockingly, frankly, un-American signal to the world.
Just a few days ago, Trump gave an invitation to Putin to invade some of our ally—NATO allies. He said if an ally didn't spend enough money on defense, he would encourage Russia to, quote, ""do whatever the hell they want,"" end of quote.
Can you imagine a former President of the United States saying that? The whole world heard it. And the worst thing is, he means it.
No other President in our history has ever bowed down to a Russian dictator. Well, let me say this as clearly as I can: I never will.
For God's sake, it's dumb, it's shameful, it's dangerous, it's un-American.
When America gives its word, it means something. When we make a commitment, we keep it. And NATO is a sacred commitment.
Donald Trump looks at this as if it's a burden. When he looks at NATO, he doesn't see the alliance that protects America and the world. He sees a protection racket.
He doesn't understand that NATO is built on the fundamental principles of freedom, security, and national sovereignty, because, for Trump, principles never matter. Everything is transactional. He doesn't understand that the sacred commitment we have given works for us as well.
In fact, I would remind Trump and all those who would walk away from NATO: Article 5 has only been invoked once—just once in our NATO history—and it was done to stand with America after we were attacked on 9/11. We should never forget it.
You know, our adversaries have long sought to create cracks in the alliance. The greatest hope of all those who wish America harm is for NATO to fall apart. And you can be sure that they all cheered when they heard Donald Trump—when they heard what he said.
I know this: I will not walk away. I can't imagine any other President walking away. For as long as I'm President, if Putin attacks a NATO ally, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory.
Let me close with this. You've heard me say this before. Our Nation stands at an inflection point—an inflection point in history—where the decisions we make now are going to determine the course of our future for decades to come. This is one of those moments.
And I say to the House Members, House Republicans: You've got to decide. Are you going to stand up for freedom, or are you going to side with terror and tyranny? Are you going to stand with Ukraine, or are you going to stand with Putin? Will you stand with America or—or with Trump?
Republicans and Democrats in the Senate came together to send a message of unity to the world. It's time for the House Republicans to do the same thing: to pass this bill immediately, to stand for decency, stand for democracy, to stand up to a so-called leader hell-bent on weakening the American security.
And I mean this sincerely: History is watching. History is watching.
In moments like this, we have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. The world is looking to us. There is nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. In this case, acting together includes acting with our NATO allies.
God bless you all. May God protect our Speaker.
And I promise I'll come back and answer questions later.
Thank you.

Subject: Deferred Enforced Departure for Certain Palestinians
Following the horrific October 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas against Israel, and Israel's ensuing military response, humanitarian conditions in the Palestinian territories, and primarily Gaza, have significantly deteriorated. While I remain focused on improving the humanitarian situation, many civilians remain in danger; therefore, I am directing the deferral of removal of certain Palestinians who are present in the United States.
Pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interest of the United States to defer for 18 months the removal of any Palestinian subject to the conditions and exceptions provided below.
Accordingly, I hereby direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate measures to defer for 18 months the removal of any Palestinian who is present in the United States on the date of this memorandum, except for those:
(1) who have voluntarily returned to the Palestinian territories after the date of this memorandum;
(2) who have not continuously resided in the United States since the date of this memorandum;
(3) who are inadmissible under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) or deportable under section 237(a)(4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4));
(4) who have been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors committed in the United States, or who meet any of the criteria set forth in section 208(b)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A));
(5) who are subject to extradition;
(6) whose presence in the United States the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined is not in the interest of the United States or presents a danger to public safety; or
(7) whose presence in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.
I further direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate measures to authorize employment for noncitizens whose removal has been deferred, as provided by this memorandum, for the duration of such deferral, and to consider suspending regulatory requirements with respect to F-1 nonimmigrant students who are Palestinians as the Secretary of Homeland Security determines to be appropriate.
The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

I'm heading off to East Palestine in a moment, but I wanted to say a few things this morning about Alexei Navalny.
You know, like millions of people around the world, I am literally both not surprised and outraged by the news, the reported death of Alexei Navalny.
He bravely stood up to the corruption, the violence, and the—all the—all the bad things that the Putin government was doing.
In response, Putin had him poisoned. He had him arrested. He had him prosecuted for fabricated crimes. He sentenced him to prison. He was held in isolation. Even all that didn't stop him from calling out Putin's lies. Even in prison, he was a powerful voice of the truth, which is kind of amazing when you think about it.
And he could have lived safely in exile after the assassination attempt on him in 2020—which nearly killed him, I might add. And—but he was traveling outside the country at the time. Instead, he returned to Russia. He returned to Russia knowing he'd likely be imprisoned or even killed if he continued his work. But he did it anyway, because he believed so deeply in his country—in Russia.
Reports of his death, if they're true—and I have no reason to believe they're not—Russian authorities are going to tell their own story. But make no mistake—make no mistake—Putin is responsible for Navalny's death. Putin is responsible.
What has happened to Navalny is yet more proof of Putin's brutality. No one should be fooled—not in Russia, not at home, not anywhere in the world. Putin does not only target his [the; White House correction] citizens of other countries, as we've seen what's going on in Ukraine right now, he also inflicts terrible crimes on his own people.
And as people across Russia and around the world are mourning Navalny today because he was so many things that Putin was not: He was brave. He was principled. He was dedicated to building a Russia where the rule of law existed and of—where it applied to everybody. Navalny believed in that Russia—that Russia. He knew it was a cause worth fighting for and, obviously, even dying for.
This tragedy reminds us of the stakes of this moment. We have to provide the funding so Ukraine can keep defending itself against Putin's vicious onslaughts and war crimes. You know, there was a bipartisan Senate vote that passed overwhelmingly in the United States Senate to fund Ukraine.
Now, as I've said before, and I mean this in the literal sense: History is watching. History is watching the House of Representatives. The failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten. It's going to go down in the pages of history. It really is. It's consequential.
And the clock is ticking. And this has to happen. We have to help now. You know, we have to realize what we're dealing with with Putin.
All of us should reject the dangerous statements made by the previous President that invited Russia to invade our NATO allies if they weren't paying up. He said if an ally did not pay their dues, he'd encourage Russia to, quote, ""do whatever the hell they want.""
Let me—I guess I should clear my mind here a little bit and not say what I'm really thinking. But let me be clear: This is an outrageous thing for a President to say. I can't fathom. I can't fathom. From Truman on, they're rolling over in their graves hearing this.
As long as I'm President, America stands by our sacred commitment to our NATO allies as they have stood by their commitments to us repeatedly.
Putin and the whole world should know: If any adversary were to attack us, our NATO allies would back us. And if Putin were to attack a NATO ally, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory. Now is the time for even greater unity among our NATO allies to stand up to the threat that Putin's Russia poses.
You know, I send my deepest condolences to Alexei's staff and supporters who are going to continue his work despite this loss, despite all of Putin's desperate attempts to stamp out the opposition.
And most of all, to his family, especially to his wife, his daughter, and his son, who have already sacrificed so much for their family and a shared dream for a better future for Russia.
So I just want to say God bless Alexei Navalny. His courage will not be forgotten. And I'm sure it will not be the only courage we see coming out of Russia in the near term.
Thank you. I'll be happy to take a couple questions.
Circumstances of the Reported Death of Russian Opposition Leader Alexei Navalny 
Q. Sir, first, was this an assassination?
The President. The answer is, I—we don't know exactly what happened, but there is no doubt that the death of Navalny was a consequence of something that Putin and his thugs did.
Russia/Ukraine/U.S. and International Sanctions Against Russia 
Q. And to be clear, you warned Vladimir Putin when you were in Geneva of ""devastating"" consequences if Navalny died in Russian custody. What consequences should he and Russia face?
The President. That was 3 years ago. In the meantime, they faced a hell of a lot of consequences. They've lost and/or had wounded over 350,000 Russian soldiers. They've made it into a position where they've been subjected to great sanctions across the board. And we're contemplating what else could be done.
But the—what we were talking about at the time: There were no actions being taken against Russia. And that—look at all that's transpired since then.
Russia-U.S. Relations 
Q. Can you say whether you're——
Q. How do you think this——
Q. ——whether you're looking at increasing sanctions on Russia right now?
The President. We're looking at a whole number of options. That's all I'll say right now.
U.S. Assistance to Ukraine 
Q. Is there anything you can do to get ammunition to the Ukrainians without the supplemental from Congress?
The President. No, but it's about time they step up—don't you think?—instead of going on a 2-week vacation. Two weeks they're walking away. Two weeks. What are they thinking? My God, this is bizarre.
And it's just reinforcing all the concern and—almost—I won't say ""panic,"" but real concern about the United States being a reliable ally. This is outrageous.
U.S. Assistance to Ukraine 
Q. Are you more confident now that you'll get the Ukraine aid given what's happened today?
The President. Well, I hope to God it helps. But I mean, the idea we need anything more to get the Ukraine aid—I mean, just—this is—in light of a former President's statement that—saying Russia, if—they haven't paid their dues to us, go get them.
Come on. What are these guys doing? What are they doing?
Russian Technological Capabilities in Space 
Q. Sir, how concerned are you about the antisatellite capability that Russia is developing? And what is your administration planning to do in response?
The President. First of all, there is no nuclear threat to the people of America or anywhere else in the world with what Russia is doing at the moment. Number one.
Number two, anything that they're doing and/or they will do relates to satellites and space and damaging those satellites, potentially.
Number three, I—there is no evidence that they have made a decision to go forward with doing anything in space either. So what we found out: There was a capacity to launch a system into space that could theoretically do something that was damaging. Hasn't happened yet. And my expectation—I—my hope is, it will not.
Q. Mr. President, just quickly——
White House staffer. Thank you all. Thank you, pool.
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]
Q. Quickly, Mr. President, have——
The President. I'll—take one more.
Situation in Gaza, Palestinian Territories/Israeli Military Operations/Hostages Held by Hamas 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Switching gears for a moment. Have the Israelis presented a credible evacuation plan for the nearly 1.5 million displaced Palestinians sheltering in Rafah? And what would the consequences be for Israel if they move ahead with a full-scale ground invasion without clear measures to protect civilians there?
The President. Well, first of all, I've had extensive conversations with the Prime Minister of Israel over the last several days, almost an hour each. And I've made the case—and I feel very strongly about it—that there has to be a temporary cease-fire to get the prisoners out, to get the hostages out. And that is underway. I'm still hopeful that that can be done.
And in the meantime, I don't anticipate—I'm hoping that that you—that the Israelis will not make any massive land invasion in the meantime. So it's my expectation that's not going to happen.
There has to be a cease-fire temporarily to get those hostages—and by the way, there are—we're in a situation where there are American hostages, American citizens that are being held hostage. It's not just—not just Israelis; it's American hostages as well.
And you know, my hope and expectation is that we'll get this hostage deal. We'll bring the Americans home. And the deal is being negotiated now, and we're going to see where it takes us.
[Several reporters began speaking at once.]
House of Representatives Impeachment Inquiry Into the President's Finances 
Q. An FBI—an FBI informant—an FBI informant at the center of the impeachment inquiry into you has been indicted for allegedly lying. Your reaction to that, and should the inquiry be dropped?
The President. He is lying, and it should be dropped. And it's just been a—it's been an outrageous effort from the beginning. What he did——
[Several reporters began speaking at once.]
The President. No, I'm serious.
[Several reporters spoke at once.]
The President. Thank you. Thank you, all.
See you in Ohio.""	Remarks on the Reported Death of Russian Opposition Leader Alexei Navalny and an Exchange With Reporters"
"Feb 16, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-supporting-response-efforts-the-train-derailment-and-chemical-spill-east-palestine,"Remarks on Supporting Response Efforts to the Train Derailment and Chemical Spill in East Palestine, Ohio","""The President. Good afternoon, folks. Mayor Conaway, thank you for the welcome and, more importantly, for your leadership. I really mean it. We talked outside there.
Mayor Trent Conaway of East Palestine, OH. Thank you, sir.
The President. You've been through hell.
And I also want to thank the EPA Administrator here with me, EPA Administrator Regan, as well.
We just concluded a briefing about the herculean efforts—and that's not a hyperbole—the herculean efforts that were made in the year since this tragedy. But what's happening in the morning, the evening of, and the next day and the weeks in following is amazing. It's absolutely amazing what this community rose to.
You know, I want to thank the folks of East Palestine to know—I want them to understand that we're not going home, no matter what, till this job is done. And it's not done yet. There's a lot more to do. The vast majority has been done, but we're going to stay until the very end, every need is met.
And I want to—we continue to hold Norfolk Southern accountable and make sure they make your community whole now and in the future. And what they do not make whole, what they cannot make whole, what isn't made—the Government will make whole. We have an obligation. We have an obligation.
I can already see this derailment won't define you. It just—it defines you in a different way: your courage, the resilience of this community, and the compassion that you've shown for all your fellow citizens.
Let me be clear: While there are acts of God, this was an act of greed that was 100-percent preventable. Let me say it again: An act of greed that was 100-percent preventable. We were pushing railroads to take more precautions, to deal with braking, to deal with a whole range of things that were not dealt with. Norfolk Southern failed its responsibility.
You know, multimillion-dollar railroad companies transporting toxic chemicals have responsibility to do it safely. And, again, Norfolk Southern failed.
My administration was on the ground within hours, working closely with the Governor, the mayor, the Senators, the House Members, community leaders to make sure you have everything you need.
My administration ordered Norfolk Southern to clean up the mess it created and ensure it was done right. That includes an Executive order I signed to continue our priority to hold Norfolk Southern fully accountable for this disaster and any long-term effects that are able to be identified as time goes on, not just here but also in Darlington, Pennsylvania, where I just visited a few hours ago—an hour or so ago.
Working with the State, we've tested the air, the water, the soil quality; deployed teams of health experts; provided emergency loans for local businesses. But it's not done yet. There's more to do.
Today I'm announcing the award of six National Institutes of Health grants to some of America's best research universities to study the short- and long-term impacts of what happened here. That includes just north of here at Case Western University, so you'll have a top researcher with you as long as you need, as long as has to go on.
I also want to restate my support for the bipartisan rail safety—bill—Senator Brown, Senator Vance, and the Congressman from Pennsylvania and others—that require stronger protective measures when trains are carrying hazardous waste.
Storage tank cars—we argued about this for years—they should be stronger. They should be able to survive crashes without exploding. Undated [updated; White House correction] brakes that meet higher safety standards. The fact of the matter is, there was a lot of discussion ahead of time, before this occurred, about the safety of the braking systems of many of these railroads—trains.
More staffing on trains so that there are more people to respond immediately to a crash and to do so much more—[inaudible]—safety of transportation.
And it's important that the Senate follow the House and pass the tax reform bill, which makes sure that folks who don't get hit with a tax—a surprise tax bill for compensation owed them by the railroad, that's not taxable income to them. We've got to make sure that that occur, that no one is taxed for anything that is reimbursed or received from Norfolk Southern.
It's not right. I support the tax—this tax reform bill, and we've got to get it done.
All told, we've done in 1 year what would typically take many years, and we're going to keep going.
Like I said, your compassion and resilience of the leadership of this community and the people of this community—the courage of your firefighters, law enforcement officers, first responders who run into danger to save others—they deserve the care and resources we owe them to be followed and their health needs followed as well. Because that's what we do.
It doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican or Independent. What matters is we're all Americans—everyone, everyone. We look out for one another. We leave no one behind. And we come back stronger than before.
That's what you're doing here. That's what's happening right here in this community. That's what's going on downtown, in your parks as well. You're now—your downtown is reopened, and the parks are reopened. Students were frustrated: Opposing schools wouldn't travel here for sports events, but now you're playing home games again, finally.
That's pride. That's also progress. But we have other obligation, and that's here—to stay here as long as it takes to get everything done and be sure no one is left behind.
In moments like this, let's remember who we are. We're the United States of America, for God's sake. We have obligations to one another. There's nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. And we're going to stay here and do it together as long as it takes.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
We have a lot to do.
Now, let me turn this over to EPA Administrator, Michael Regan, and he'll have a few things to say as well.
Michael.

"Feb 20, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-reception-beverly-hills-california,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Beverly Hills, California","""The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Please sit down. I'm sure you're standing up because you're so bored of sitting down all this time. [Laughter]

Leslie, thank you for that introduction.

And a special thanks to Haim and Cheryl and opening their home to us. And to Casey for cohosting. I wish them the quickest recovery.

And thanks to all of you for your support and—including Congressman Brad Sherman. Where are you, Brad? There you are. You've come through one of the toughest periods in recent American history.

Look, folks, you know, I wouldn't wait this long for anybody except possibly—can you—what's—what's her name? Jane Fonda. [Laughter] I wouldn't do this for anybody else, Jane—wait this long.

But thank you. Thank you all very, very much.

Look, folks, I'm going to try to—I'm going to shorten what I was going to say in the interest of your sanity and a little bit of time. I'd like to talk about the future and what it means to finish the job.

Folks, ""finish the job"" means beating Big Pharma again to keep lowering drug prices across the entire country. We made insulin drop from about $40—$400 a month to about $35—not—you can't charge more than $35 for seniors on Medicare. We wanted to make it for everyone, but Republicans blocked it.

""Finishing the job"" means $35 insulin for everyone with diabetes, lowering drug prices for dozens of other prescriptions, and by the way, saving—saving the Federal Government—reducing the debt over 10 years by $260 billion. It reduces the debt. It means that the—Medicare is not paying those prices.

Trump and his MAGA friends have promised again to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, the law that provides millions—millions—of Americans with preexisting condition the opportunity to have insurance. They wouldn't have it without that.

""Finish the job"" means protecting and expanding the Affordable Care Act. It means protecting and strengthening Social Security and Medicare that our MAGA Republicans—not all—this—by the way, let me—I should say at the outset: This is not your father's Republican Party. This a different party. And I mean that sincerely. There's a lot of really, really fine Members of Congress that are Republicans that I disagree with, but we're friends and they play it straight.

But look, they want to put Medicare and they want to put Social Security on the chopping block. Trump wants to do away with the most historic action ever on climate.

""Finishing the job"" means implementing the Inflation Reduction Act at every—every—level and building a clean energy future here in America. That's what it's all about. And by the way, you all know in California there's no global warming. [Laughter] This is like it—this is what it's like every year, right?

Look, folks, finish the job means making housing more affordable and accessible.

We've made progress—[applause]. We've made progress on tax fairness, making sure the biggest corporations pay their fair share with a minimum corporate tax of 15 percent, and that's not even enough.

By the way, I—in case you wonder, I know a little about corporations. I come from a State that has more corporations incorporated than every other State in America combined, and I represented it for 36 years. I think they should be able to function to make money but not—they should pay their taxes.

They also helped pay for our historic investments to help reduce the Federal deficit. We've—but we're—but we're not done.

Trump's $2 trillion tax cut, which is about to expire, overwhelmingly helped the very, very wealthiest of us, but not the vast majority of the American people.

""Finishing the job"" means getting rid of Trump's tax cut, closing loopholes. You know, we have a thousand billionaires now in America after—since the—a thousand. You know what the average Federal tax they pay: 8.3 percent. Who want—raise your hand if you only want to pay 8.3 percent. [Laughter]

But all—but all kidding aside, if we just charge them 28 percent, which is not even getting into the highest category, it's $400 billion over 10 years in additional revenue.

But, folks, look—look, we have to plan for the long term: paying for our priorities like childcare, long-term health care, and so much more. It's good for families, and it's also good for the economy. The economy grows when more women are able to work because there's someone able to take care of their children.

Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away your fundamental freedoms. They attack the right to vote you—have your vote counted. ""Finish the job"" means the John Lewis Voting Rights Act should be passed—should be passed.

Donald Trump continues to amaze me. He brags about overturning Roe v. Wade, taking away a woman's freedom to choose. Now reports show he supports a national ban on the right to choose across the board, every State—not leave it to the States—every State.

I'm determined to restore Roe v. Wade. Let me make it clear. And if MAGA Republicans pass a national ban on the right to choose, I will veto it. And if reelected—me and Kamala—and we take back the House and a bigger majority in the Senate, we're going to finish the job. We're going to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again. We can do that.

And I keep my promise—I kept it to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I've appointed more Black women to the Federal courts of appeals than every other President combined in all of American history. ""Finish the job"" means getting more judges on the bench across the board.

All the progress matters from the American people in the positions—to put us in a position to win in 2024. And that brings me to my second point: I have to make a constant—and we have to contrast the choices between Trump and me. We've got to make them crystal clear.

Time and again, Republicans show they're a party of chaos and disunion. They'll shout about the problems, but there's nothing they—they offer about them. Think about it. They have no platform. I'm—not a joke. They have no platform.

Look at what they're doing with the bipartisan immigration and border bill. We worked—I put together—we put together a group of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and the House. And we worked on this for 5 months—4 months, and we came up with an answer.

The first bill I ever introduced in the United States Senate—in the Congress as President was an immigration bill to provide them the means to be able to have enough judges, enough—enough Border Patrol, enough—down the line, they don't have it—enough technology to be able to determine whether fentanyl is being hidden, et cetera.

We get a bill, and—and guess what? It passes. It passes—I mean, it gets a consensus in the Senate. And guess what happens? After making this issue for years, the House Republicans and the new leader took a 2-week vacation instead of actually getting it done.

Why? Because Donald Trump literally was on the phone telling them: If you vote for this legislation, giving the authority to really make progress at the border and give all the means necessary to control the border, then you're my—I don't know what he exactly said—you're going to be my retribution. But that's the kind of language he uses.

Look at what they're doing with the national security supplemental bill that provides assistance to Ukraine, Israel, and the Palestinian people: nothing. Not a single thing. Why? Because that's what Donald Trump tells them to do.

The same guy who said if an ally didn't pay their dues, he would encourage Russia to, quote, ""do whatever the hell they want."" A former American President—can you imagine him saying that—the President of the United States?

But you see it all on television. I don't even have to tell you about it anymore. It's constantly on television, the things he's saying.

When Putin—this fierce opposition to—anyway, I shouldn't get going. [Laughter] But look, when Navalny died last week and the world holds Putin responsible, Trump fails to even condemn him. It's outrageous.

Bottom line is Republicans have to decide: Who do they serve, Donald Trump or the American people? Because that's where it is right now. Are they here to solve problems or just weaponize them for political attacks?

I know my answer. I'm here—I'm here to serve the American people. And let me make it very clear, we—if we make that clear to all the American people, we're going to win. Just look at 2020. They told us we weren't going to win when I talked about democracy was at stake; 2020, we won, notwithstanding the fact we only did it by 7 million votes—[laughter]—2022 was going to be the red wave, remember?

For the best year for an off year for an incumbent President ever, 2023: We won every contested major race in the country.

So, folks, when voters have a choice between what we stand for, what Trump and his MAGA Republicans stand for, we win.

And that gets me to my final point. We can't take anything for granted. In 2020, I ran because I thought everything this country stood for, everything we believed in, everything that made America ""America"" was at risk.

I'd made a speech in Independence Hall—I made several of them saying democracy was at stake. The press said, ""What's he talking about democracy for?"" Well, guess what? Sixty-five percent of the American people thought I was right, because they worry about it being at risk.

I think people thought I was being hyperbolic at the time. ""Joe, what do you mean, 'Democracy is at risk'? What do you mean, 'We're in the battle for the soul of America'?"" Well, people don't say that anymore.

Trump and his MAGA friends are driving us not—and dividing us every step of the way, not uniting us; dragging us back to the past, not leading us to the future; refusing to accept the results of a legitimate election; seeking, as Trump says, to ""terminate""—his word—""terminate"" elements of the United States Constitution; embracing political violence; calling January 6 insurrectionists ""patriots."" He called these guys ""patriots,"" and he says he's going to pardon them if he wins. Calling immigrants ""vermin"" who ""poison the blood of our country,"" threatening our very democracy.

Well, folks, we have to make clear that we stand with the truth, and we're going to defeat him and his lies. We must make clear in America that we still believe in honesty, decency, respect. We believe that we're all created equal and deserve to be treated equal. We haven't lived up to that. We've never walked away from it, though.

Look, folks, we leave nobody behind. We believe everyone deserves a—just a fair shot. And we give hate no safe harbor. We believe in America.

Folks, the stakes couldn't be higher. They're the highest they've ever been. We've made more progress in 3 years than most Presidents have made in 8 years, because of the help of all of you. I wouldn't be standing here without you.

But it can all be wiped out in this election. So we have to stay focused on what we have to do to win. We have to get out the vote. We have to keep the White House. We have to increase the numbers in the Senate. And we have to take back the House.

And when we do that, we'll look back and say something few generations are able to say: We saved American democracy when it was at risk. I think it really is literally that—that consequential.

Look, folks, we've got to remember who the hell we are. We are the United States of America. There's nothing, nothing, nothing we've ever failed to do when we set our mind to it and did it together. So—well—[laughter]. So we've got to move again. We've got to move in a way that—and I think the American people are ready for it.

And by the way, I know I'm only 40 years old—[laughter]—times two. And—but you know, the only thing I do know is that I may not run as fast as I used to, I may not be able to play flanker back for Delaware again but—[inaudible]. But I tell you what—I tell you what: I've been around long enough to know what's going on. I've been around long enough to, hopefully, with age, have a little bit of wisdom about how we can get things done.

And so far, with your help, we've gotten a lot done. The vast majority of Presidential historians—Democrat, Republican, conservative, and liberal—have pointed to the success you've allowed this administration to have. It's real.

We have the finest economy in the world. We've got a lot more work to do—a lot more work to do. But things are beginning to move. We can't slow down now.

As I said, I've been doing this a long time. And the fact of the matter is—and I say this from the bottom of my heart: I've never been more optimistic about America's chances. Never.

Every single world leader that I've known, and I've known all of them—literally all of them the last 40 years—every single one, when I attend international meetings now—not a joke—grabs my arm and says: ""You've got to win. You've got to win because my democracy is at stake.""

And it's not about me. It's about America keeping its commitments. It's about America keeping its commitments. And we're going to—we're going to do it.

Again, I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long. And I'm sorry to speak as long as I did. But there's a lot we can do together. A lot. And I really mean it: I am truly optimistic.

You know, my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it—and mean it.""

Just give them a chance. The vast majority of people are just looking for a chance. And I think that's what the economy we put together is doing: giving them a chance. We have the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years.

And so I won't go through the—but the point is—Madeleine Albright wrote a book about America before she passed away. She said America is the essential country. Many of you travel the world. We are the essential country. Name me another country that has the potential capacity to keep the free world free, to hold the nations together as we've done.

This is the United States of America. There's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity.

Thanks for your patience. [Inaudible] Thank you. And God bless our troops. Thank you."""

Jerry, for the longest time after being elected, I'd hear ""Hail to the Chief"" played, and I'd turn around and wonder: Where the hell was he? [Laughter]
Look, I want to thank Gordon and I want to thank George for that introduction and cohosting us tonight.
And a special thanks to—and it was said twice tonight, but she can tell you I've been saying this for the last 4 years: the single best Speaker of the House of Representatives in American history. Nancy and Paul, your entire family are some of our dearest friends to Jill, me, and my family. And, Nance, thank you for everything.
Thank you for—and, Jerry, I—it's so good to see you. Of all I was asked about—I guess about 8 months ago, I was doing an interview and asked who was the most talented person I've ever dealt with. And I think the most talented person at the moment I ever dealt with was you. No, I mean that sincerely. Because you had—you always had a vision that was clear and precise. And any rate, and thanks for what you continue to do on the environment. [Inaudible]
And Mike and Anna, thank you for all the legislation I'm getting credit for. [Laughter] Well, you know, I may have introduced it, but you got it done. You got it done for us.
And—look, and thanks to all of you for your support.
Folks, please continue to eat. I'm used to not being taken seriously. [Laughter] No, really, don't—let's keep this as informal as can be.
The fact is that I'm getting pretty old, but I did not know Aristotle. I was only kidding. [Laughter]
Look, folks, I think it's fair to say we've been through one of the toughest periods in our Nation's history. And I like to think about the future that it's going to take to finish the job we started. I think we got off to a pretty good start, but there's a long way to go.
And ""finish the job"" means beating Big Pharma again. You know, if any of you have a prescription and you get in Air Force One—I can fly anywhere in the world. And I can fly you to Toronto, to Paris, to London, to—and you're going to pay 40- to 60-percent less for that same exact drug made by the same exact company.
And so it's just—we've been fighting Big Pharma for a long, long time. Any of you—all know somebody who needs insulin for—diabetes or other purposes. And you know, they're paying up to 400 to 500 bucks a month. Now they're not going to pay more than $35 a month.
It's all about giving people an even chance.

The President. No, I—no, I mean it. I'm not looking for applause. I'm looking for making the case that what we—there's so much we can do.
You know, and we—originally when I got it passed with the help of the people in this room, it affected everybody. But then the Republicans turned it back, and we had to reauthorize it and only for the elderly.
But I want to make a point. You know, not only does it lower prices for the elderly, those on Medicare and Medicaid, but it does something else. It saves the United States of America $260 billion [$160 billion; White House correction] over the next 10 years—$260 billion [$160 billion] in the legislation we passed, including limiting—the price that any senior has to pay to $2,000 a year for all the drugs they consume.
And you—many of you know, because you're philanthropists who work on cancer: Some of these drugs are $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year. But it not only saves the patient and access to the patient, but it saves the deficit—it reduces the deficit. It doesn't increase it.
Lower drug prices for dozens of other—prescriptions are coming up in the bill we passed. But it also saves taxpayers these exorbitant amounts they have to pay in taxes as well.
Today, our MAGA friends are again promising to get rid of the Affordable Care Act that lowered—that—it's the only thing that protects a lot of low-income people with a preexisting condition. There's no other way they can get insurance. And we're going to ""finish the job,"" meaning protecting and expanding the Affordable Care Act.
It means protecting and strengthening Social Security and Medicare. Republicans want to put it on a chopping block. You may remember the last State of the Union I gave with that encounter with our friends on the—the Republicans on the floor, who I—one of the thing I got them to do spontaneously was get them to commit they weren't going to try to lower it last—remember? Remember that? [Laughter] They were all booing.
Well, guess what? Trump wants to do away with most of the historic action we've taken on climate. I've been out here, met with a climate group and some of the—in California overall, but around the country, and many of you are involved in philanthropies that deal with global warming. It is the only truly existential threat to humanity. We have to gain control of it.
And ""finish the job"" means that the Inflation Reduction Act get every—every single—every single element of it has to work for clean energy here in America. And that's what we're doing. We're investing more in climate change than any country ever has in the history of the world and ever been introduced—ever had occurred.
So ""finish the job"" means making housing affordable—more affordable and more accessible. And it's made programs on tax fairness by making sure the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.
You know, all the stuff we passed, as you recall, we're give—we're given credit by the Presidential historians now. Guess what? We did it and still reduced the deficit by over a trillion—$7 trillion [$1 trillion; White House correction]. Because guess what? The fact of the matter is, it saved money. It didn't cost money.
But they're at it again. And the way we paid for it—we did a terrible thing: We raised the corporate tax to 15 percent. [Laughter] Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. [Laughter] And by the way, that helped pay for the historic investments and reduced the deficit.
But we're not done. The Trump tax cut that was not paid—not a penny of which was paid for of $2 trillion overwhelmingly benefited those in the top quarter-percent, overwhelmingly—and super wealthy and the biggest corporations. It exploded the deficit.
You know, ""finishing the job"" means to get to—let the trust—the Trump tax cut, which expires this year, let it expire and provide a minimum tax for corporations. Not—[inaudible]—I'm not talking about the old 60-percent stuff. Twenty-eight percent—twenty-eight percent would mean a gigantic change and give middle class, hard-working folks a big effort—a big advantage.
In addition to that, we're in a situation where—you know, we now have—which is not a bad—I'm a capitalist, although I—for 36 years, I was listed as the poorest man in Congress. [Laughter] Not a joke. I got a phone call, Jer, when I was campaigning for Pat Leahy in the mid-nineties.
And I got a call—I called every night, as you all when you're away and your kid is at home. I called Jill, who was teaching school—my wife. And I said, ""How are you doing?"" And she said, ""Fine."" [Laughter] Okay, well, I'm in trouble. I said, ""What's the matter?"" ""Nothing.""
I said, ""Jill, what's the matter?"" She said, ""Did you read today's paper?""—meaning the Wilmington News Journal. And I said, ""They don't have it up here, honey."" And she said: ""Well, top of the fold, 'Biden, Poorest Man in Congress.' Is that true?"" [Laughter] I swear to God, true story.
But any rate, the point is that we now have—which—I'm a capitalist. I'm all for people making as much money as they can fairly. But just—just pay your fair share.
Closing loophole—right now, there are a thousand billionaires in America. It was 780 before the—before the recession. It was a recession, but before the—we got in the—in the problem of the——
Audience member. The pandemic?
The President. ——dealing with the pandemic. And—but there are now a thousand of them. They pay—you know what the average Federal rate they pay? Eight-point-two percent tax—Federal taxes. If they just paid at 28 percent, it would generate another $400 billion in tax revenue over the next 10 years—$400 billion, 28 percent.
Most of you would trade that—wouldn't you?—28 percent.
And guess what? We'd be able to lift up long-term priorities like childcare, long-term care for the elderly at home—keeping them home, which I might add also generates economic growth and income. It's good for families, but it's also really good for the economy.
Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away our fundamental freedoms. ""Finish the job"" means passing the John Lewis Voting Right Act. I did what I could by Executive order, but we need a national legislation to be passed.
Trump brags about having overturned Roe v. Wade, taking away a woman's freedom to choose. Now reports show him supporting a national ban. He doesn't—not just the Supreme Court and let the States choose. He wants to pass national legislation out of the Congress, which he has—would have the right to do if he could get the votes, to eliminate the right to choose. I think he's now said up to 16 weeks. He keeps changing it.
Well, I made it clear: If MAGA Republicans tried a national ban on the right to choose, I'm going to veto it. And if you reelect Kamala and me and we take back the House, we're going to change the law so we have Roe v. Wade reinstalled in every single State in America. We have the power to do that.
No, no, I'm serious. We can do that if we—so not only thank you for helping me, but help the local officials, help Congresspersons, help Senators.
Look, I kept my promises, you know, to—I said I'd appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. Well, I did. And by the way, Ketanji Brown Jackson, she's smarter than the rest of these guys. [Laughter] She—and by the way, she is truly impressive. Mark my words. She's going to go down in history not just as the first Black woman, but one of the brightest and most informed.
And by the way, I didn't realize this. I kept appointing women to the appellate courts of the—of the circuit courts of appeal Federally. I've appointed more women to the Federal appeals court and minorities than every other President in history combined—combined.
And we—""finish the job"" means getting more judges on the bench—more judges. We're up—we're providing—we're up to 174 [177; White House correction]. And because one of the things we have to focus on is these local issues. We've got to focus on making sure we have the judges on those—on the—on the circuit courts, on the—on the appellate courts, on—judges that we can appoint nationally and locally.
Now, look, folks, all this progress matters to American people and positions us to win in 2024.
And that brings me to my second point. I'm not going to go much longer. You know, we have a choice to make. And to make a contrast, which I think is crystal clear: I'm often quoted as saying, ""Don't compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative."" Well, this alternative is a different breed of cat.
Representative Nancy Pelosi. Don't say that about cats. [Laughter]
The President. No, I'm—I know you know I'm—serious.
Look, folks, all kidding aside. You know, Jerry is a lot younger than me, but you know—[laughter]—but the truth is, I've been a Senator since 1972. I got elected in '72. And the prospect of—here—here's what's going on: I've served with real racists. I served with Strom Thurmond. I served with all these guys that—that have set terrible records on race.
But guess what? These guys are worse. These guys are worse. These guys do not believe in basic democratic principles.
You know, at least in the old days, you'd have Ted Kennedy in Judiciary Committee going at—at Jim Eastland. And then, he'd go down in the Senate dining room, and they'd have—they'd have—have lunch together.
So I got a phone call from Strom Thurmond's wife when he was a hundred years old, dying at Walter Reed Hospital, saying ""Joe""—I said, ""How's Leader—how—how's Strom?"" And she said, ""Well, he's on God's time now, Joe.""
And I [she; White House correction] said, ""I'm standing here at the nurse's station with a doctor—his doctor."" And she named the doctor. I don't remember the name. ""And he said he asked us to come out and call you. Will you do his eulogy?"" And I thought, ""Holy God."" I did his eulogy. I started off by saying to my grandfather, Grandpa Finnegan, ""Forgive me for what I'm about to do."" [Laughter]
But I told the truth. Because by the time Strom left—he did terrible things. But by the time he left, he had more African Americans on his staff than any other member of the United States Congress. He voted to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. He finally—a lot of it broke through—a lot of it broke though.
I'm not making it more than it was, but my point is, at least you could work with some of these guys.
Time and again, Republicans show what the party of chaos and a party of division. I don't think any of you in this room—and you're all sophisticated as hell about American politics. Look at what they're doing.
The bipartisan immigration and border bill gets passed after far—almost 5 weeks of negotiation—Democrat and Republican. It was a tough, tough deal. And I said I would support the outcome. Didn't have all that I wanted in it, but it makes—there were some real problems. They're short about two—about 3,000 workers down there, from Border Patrol to a whole range—the judges and the rest.
Well, you know, we—so we—get a bill. And we—Democrats and Republicans pass it. And then Trump gets on the phone, I'm told. I didn't hear any of it. He gets on the phone, and he says—he tells the House Members that if you vote for this, I'm coming after you. I don't know that he actually used the word ""retribution,"" but you're going to be a problem.
They changed their mind. Why? Because he said, ""It will help Biden—it will help Biden if you do this. If you help him solve the border problem, it's going to cause me—so don't do it.""
I don't remember that happening before. I don't remember that happening before.
And look at what they're doing on national security. The so-called supplemental bill, the one that has money for Israel, for Taiwan, for the—not for—dealing with what's going on in Ukraine, et cetera—and Israel.
Well, guess what? You saw Trump. You know, he is—he is incredible. He stands there and he tells them—what he says is outrageous.
He says that NATO—first of all, he doesn't like NATO. He wanted to pull out of it completely. He has no notion of its importance. It's—kept the world safe, in terms of world war, since—for 70 years.
And he says to—he said: If, in fact, NATO members don't pay their dues exactly what they say they're going to pay when they pay it, he welcomed—you saw it on television—he welcomed Putin to invade that country, and we would do nothing.
Bottom line: The Republican Party—and I never thought I'd say this before, because I've tried to work across the aisle—the Republican Party has to decide: Who do they serve? Do they serve Donald Trump or do they serve the American people? Are they here to solve problems or just weaponize these things into political attacks?
I know the answer. I'm here to serve the American people with what I do, just like all of you do when you serve. When we make clear—when we make that clear, we win.
Look at 2020, 2022, and 2023. I was told when I made that speech running in 2020 at— the Independence Hall about democracy being at stake—the press looked and said: ""Well, what the hell is he talking about? What—making this up."" Well, 63 percent of the American people thought I was—it was true. They got it. We were supposed to get our rear-end kicked. We won by 7 million votes—and we won.
Well, guess what? We're in a same situation now. The American people know our democracy is literally at stake—not hyperbole.
I have spent a lot of time in foreign policy—my whole career. I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And one of the reasons why Barack asked me to be Vice President because of my background in foreign policy and knowing these world leaders. I know them all, and I've known them—that doesn't make me—I just meant I've been around a while. I know them all.
Well, guess what we did? Before Kissinger died, I got a phone call—about 10 days before he passed away: Would I call? And I called him. And here's what he said, Jer. He said, ""Not since Napoleon has Europe not looked over its shoulder at Russia and worried about its prospects until you guys came along. You united NATO. You expanded NATO. And it's changed the world. It's changed the world.""
Imagine what happens if this guy gets elected and steps out of NATO. Imagine what that does.
My first meeting with Putin after getting elected, he told me what he wanted to do and he made a lot of demands. Anyway, I said, ""You want to""—he kept asking. I said: ""You want the Findalization [Finlandization; White House correction] of NATO. I'm telling you, you're going get the NATOization of Finland if you keep this up."" We expanded NATO with Finland and Sweden. No, I don't need—but—my point is—my point is that we have a—we're at one of those inflection points, as I said, where what we do in the next year or two is going to determine the fate of this country for the better part of the next four or five decades, just like the postwar era determined what the decade—next—the decades would be.
And so, look, let me get to the final point. We can't take anything for granted. Trump and his MAGA friends are dividing us, not uniting us. If you notice, they have no platform. You ever see a party that doesn't have any platform going—no platform going into an election? None.
They're dragging us back to the past, not leading us to the future; refusing to accept the results of a legitimate election; seeking, as Trump says, to ""terminate"" elements of the Constitution. He talks about eliminating elements of the Constitution because of his Presidential power to do so.
He's—embraces political violence. When was the last President since—the Civil War that's embraced violence? He talks about it. This is the guy who calls the January 6 insurrectionists ""patriots"" and says he's going to for—he's going to pardon them. Pardon them.
The first meeting I was in Europe as—the G-7, after I got elected. And I sat down, and we were talking about—I was with Macron, and I said, ""America is back."" There were six other heads of state. And he said, ""For how long?""
And with that, the chair—the Chancellor of Germany looked at me and said, ""Mr. President, what would you do if you picked up the paper tomorrow and the headline in the London Times was 'A thousand people crash into Parliament, break down the doors to the House, and, in fact, stopped the—recognition of a new Prime Minister'?""
Imagine what we'd think. Well, the rest of the world looks at us, wondering, ""What the hell is going on?""
Every major meeting I go to internationally—and I've gone—I've got go to fewer now because I got to spend more time home here. But every one—Anna, I'm not exaggerating—as I walk out of the meetings, a head of state will find an excuse to come up close to me and grab my arm and say, ""You've got to win."" Not because I'm so special. ""You've got to win because my democracy is at stake if the other guy wins."" Nine heads of state have done that with me. Nine.
And this guy calls—immigrants—we have a problem with immigration. We need an orderly process. It's out of control. We can fix it. The first bill I ever introduced was a bill on immigration—on—the border, calling for more agents, more rational ways to deal with this issue.
But what's he call—he calls them ""vermin"" who are ""poisoning the blood of our country""—his terms. They're threatening our democracy, according to him.
A Muslim ban—can't come to the United States.
We have to make it clear to America: We still believe, in America, in honesty, decency, some respect for one another. We believe everybody deserves—the vast majority of Americans still believes everybody deserves a fair shot. It leaves nobody behind. Just gives—you give them a shot.
My dad, who never got to go to college because of the war, but he got into Johns Hopkins and never was able to go. My dad used to always say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about decency. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it—and mean it.""
Well, folks, we're all been trained to give hate no harbor in America. We made progress in 3 years than most Presidents have taken 8 years to do because of the help I've had in the Congress, but it all can be wiped out in this election.
So we have to stay focused on what we have to do to win. We have to get out the vote. We must keep the White House, we must keep the Senate, and we have to get back the House.
And when we do that, we're going to be able to do something few generations have be able to do, and historians will write it—I won't be around to see it, but you—you guys will see it—that this generation of Americans saved democracy—saved democracy.
That's what this is—all at stake. I don't think that's hyperbole. I don't think it's exaggeration: save democracy.
We just have to—we just have to remind ourselves who we are, for God's sake. We're the United States of America—the United States of America. There's not a damn thing we can't do if we do it together.
Think about it. We're the only nation in the history of the world that has come out of every crisis stronger than we went in. That's who we are. That's who we've been, for damn sake. I really mean it.
And it angers me so much the way these guys are working these days. So, with the grace of God, the good will of the neighbors, and the crick not rising, as my grandfather would say, we got a shot.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.""	Remarks at a Campaign Reception in San Francisco, California"
"Feb 22, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-reception-los-altos-hills-california,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Los Altos Hills, California","""Hello, hello, hello. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. I think I should go home now. [Laughter]
Well, first of all, Bob and Danielle, thank you for hosting us today. It matters a lot to me, and I want to especially thank you for your philanthropy advancing medical research, including for cancer.
You know, the same goes for so many of you around this country, including our great Vice President, Kamala Harris. She's an incredible partner, and I'm not sure what I'd be able to do without her.
You know, we've made clear from day one of our administration that we believe in science, which the other guy is not quite sure exists. [Laughter] But you know, think of, if he had moved on the pandemic earlier, how many people—how many chairs would not be empty at kitchen tables these days.
It got us through the pandemic and, on behalf of everyone else, a belief that we can do just about anything we set our minds to.
You know, I truly believe we can end cancer as we know it. I've believed that for a long time. No—[applause].
I had the opportunity when I was Vice President and subsequent to that to visit every major cancer research facility in the world—in the world. And there's so much—so much—going on and so much more we can do if we fund it and provide the effort to make it a priority.
Some of you may remember, I got in a little bit of trouble when I was asked—no one ever doubts in me when I say I sometimes say all that I mean though. [Laughter] But when I—I said—they asked me when I first got elected, if I can do any one thing, what would I do. I said I'd end cancer. And they looked at me like there are other things—ending nuclear war, a whole range of other things that would be consequential.
And I said for two reasons: First of all, America used to believe we could do anything—anything we set our mind to. And that fade—that—that image began to fade; people began to wonder what we can do. We started to downplay America's capacity.
And I said if we were able to take one thing and end cancer, it would communicate to all of America that there is nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. I believe that.
That's why, when I was Vice President, I asked Barack to let me start a Cancer Moonshot. Because, you know, as President, I reinvigorated that, what we call ARPA-H. I got that from, you know, a way to fundamentally change the way we approach cancer.
And you know, one of the things is that it's a—a cure for cancer isn't going to come based on a timetable. One day, a scientist—one of you is going to walk into the lab, and you're going to find it. I said it doesn't happen, like, on a schedule. But it happens with constant, unrelenting work.
And, you know, I designed this ARPA-H with billions of dollars at the Department of Health after my work in the area of foreign and defense policy. There's an outfit at the Department of Defense called DARPA. And DARPA is the ones that came up with—transformed our Nation by creating the early GPS warning systems so far—that we've invested.
And I said if you had one thing that just focuses on what the most essential need at the moment is within the Defense Department, you'd get enormous results. And it just gets funded almost separately. But it's a focus.
And I wanted the same thing to happen at NIH. And that's why I came up with ARPA-H. Now, we've only gotten $3 billion there so far, but it's $3 billion that wasn't there before. And it matters.
Look, folks, you know, we've come through one of the toughest periods in modern American history. And I'd like to talk about the future and how we finish the job we started.
You know, ""finishing the job"" means beating Big Pharma again. When I was a Senator for 270 years—[laughter]—you know, I was at an event yesterday, and they said, ""And I want to read from""—someone said: ""I want to read from Aristotle. Now, here's Joe."" And I said, ""I knew him well."" [Laughter] ""I knew him well.""
But all kidding aside, you know, from when I was a Senator all those years, we tried to take on Big Pharma. You all know this. You're an incredibly sophisticated audience. If I put you on Air Force One with me, and you have a prescription—no matter what it's for, minor or major—and I flew you to Toronto or flew to London or flew you to Brazil or flew you anywhere in the world, I can get you that prescription filled for somewhere between 40- to 60-percent less than it costs here.
I think everybody should make a—be able to make a buck for what they do. But it's ridiculous what's going on.
And so we wanted to make sure we changed the law. We finally got it changed as President.
So—and it was a simple proposition. You know, we had a circumstance where if you want to—want to supply veterans the—in the Department of Veteran Affairs and the hospitals, they're able to negotiate the prices they're going to pay. Well, guess what? Why in the hell can't—the—why can't that be done now, in terms of dealing with what we're talking about? And so we started this effort.
And some of you know—and you certainly know; my host knows—about diabetes and other issues that require insulin. Well, you know, it was costing people—the average person—somewhere between 4- and 500 bucks a month. Now, they cannot charge more than $35 a month.
And, folks, they're still making 350-percent profit. The guy who came up with that insulin said he didn't want to patent it because he wanted it available to everyone. It costs 10 bucks to make and 13 bucks to package, maximum—35 bucks.
And we also changed the law—we changed the law for the future, beginning in 2024 [2025; White House correction], every—no senior is going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year for their combined prescription costs, even if—and some of these cancer drugs, as you all unfortunately know too well, are $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year.
And—but it's not just it saves the patients money. And saves—but it saves the—it reduces the deficit. You know, the one thing we've done so far—you know how much they're going to cut the deficit by?—$160 billion—160—because Medicare doesn't have to pay out. They have to pay out 35 bucks instead of—38 bucks or 40, instead of paying out 400 bucks for one prescription.
So anyway. We wanted everyone to make it. We wanted to make it for everybody. And we did get that passed initially, but as we went through the renegotiation process for the next budget, my MAGA friends in the Republican Party cut it out. So, to finish the job, I want to make sure 35-bucks insulin is for everybody—not just Medicare, everybody.
And the deal we were able to put into law: We're—every year, we're going to be able to get dozens of other prescription drugs. Six—six a year—new drugs can be picked. Six a year. And it also serves [saves; White House correction] taxpayers billions of dollars.
Look, Trump and his MAGA friends are promising again to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. As our host has told you, that law protects millions of Americans with preexisting conditions who are not well off. They cannot afford to get insurance.
This will be—Trump has announced they're going to do it again. This will be the 51st time that the MAGA Republicans have tried to eliminate this.
""Finish the job"" means protecting and expanding the Affordable Care Act and doing it now. You know, look, it means protecting and strengthening Social Security and Medicare. The fact is, Republicans want to put it on the chopping block.
You may remember the last State of the Union message. I was able to spontaneously embarrass them into saying they wouldn't try it last year. You remember that? They were booing me. And I said, ""How many of you out there are for cutting""—[laughter]. And I said, ""Well, raise your hand if you're going to commit to you're not going to do anything to Medicare""—[laughter].
Well, they're back at it. Medicare has to be dealt with, but not the way they're proposing it.
Trump wants to do away with the most historic action ever on climate. We're going to finish the job with the Inflation Reduction Act. We should have called it the ""Climate Act."" But you know, it calls for $368 billion—more money than ever, in all of history—to be spent on climate. And it's beginning to work. Some of you are deeply involved in the climate fight, and you know we're on the cusp of a lot of breakthroughs—a lot of breakthroughs.
And we're going to build clean energy here—here in America—invest here in America. It's on its way.
""Finish the job"" means making housing more affordable and more accessible. You know, we made progress with tax fairness. The—I come from the corporate capital of the world: Delaware. More of you are incorporated in Delaware than—[laughter]—and I got elected six times in Delaware, so—[laughter]. I'm not anticorporation, but you've got to pay your taxes. [Laughter]
And so, folks, look, making tax fairness is the big—and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share. Right now we have—I was able to increase the tax to a minimum tax of 15 percent. That paid for every one of the programs I got passed through and, plus, cut the deficit by $7 billion.
But look, here—here's what we've got to do: Trump's $2 trillion dollar tax cut—not a penny of which is paid for—some of you were able to benefit from that. I'm sure it wasn't what you asked for, but some of you. But the vast, vast majority of American people, including—by the way, I've not increased taxes for anybody over 400—4—under $400,000 a year, period.
But the point is, we're in a situation where it's gotten out of hand, and the deficit increased—it ballooned under Trump, overwhelmingly benefiting—and—but look, to finish the job, in my view, means getting rid of Trump's tax cut, which expires next year, and closing the loopholes.
Now, I hope some of you in here are billionaires. I'm a capitalist. [Laughter] No, I mean it. But paying an average of 8.2 percent ain't enough. I don't know anybody in America wouldn't trade—say, ""Want to trade for 8.2 percent for whatever you're paying?"" I don't know anybody.
But if we just had a billionaire minimum tax of 25 percent, guess what? That would raise $440 billion over the next 10 years—$440 billion—allow us to pay for everything from—it would grow the economy, from childcare, to long-term care, and so much more.
And it's not confiscatory to anybody. It's just being a little bit fair.
You know, it's good for families, but it's also good for the economy. I asked the Treasury Department to do a study on whether or not there was—what would happen if we did this. It grows the economy. It grows the economy because you've got—women are able to go out and work because they have childcare. You've got—I won't go through it all because I'm supposed to make this short. [Laughter]
But look, Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away your fundamental freedoms.
""Finish the job"" means passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, finally.
Trump brags about having taken away Roe v. Wade by the Court he appointed—a woman's freedom to choose. Well, now a new report is out there. He's saying that he wants to limit what any State can—what any State—number they can set—limit the—the right to choose across the board.
Well, guess what? I made it real clear. If our MAGA Republican friends do that, I will veto it. I will veto it.
And if you elect Kamala and me and we take back the House and a little bigger majority in the Senate, I promise you: We will fully restore Roe v. Wade——fully restore Roe v. Wade.
I kept my promise to appoint the first Black [woman; White House correction] Supreme Court Justice. And then, what I didn't realize is—I said I wanted an administration that looked like the American people. One of you said—I will—I will not use the exact phrase she used in the—in the line—but I should pay more attention to women's issues. I pointed out I wanted an administration that looked like America. I have more women in my Cabinet then men. [Laughter] There's more women in my administration than men—in my administration—across the board.
In addition to that—in addition to appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, I have appointed more women to the appellate courts than every other President in American history combined. They're part of the 177 Federal judge we've appointed so far. And ""finish the job"" means getting more judges on the bench while we can, now.
All this progress matters to the American people and positions us to win in 2024, in my view.
And that brings me to my second point: We have to make—we have to make constant and crystal clear the choice here. I am often quoted as saying what my dad would say: ""Don't compare me to the Almighty; compare me to the alternative."" Well——
[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.]
[Laughter] But look, time and again, Republicans show they're part of a party of chaos and division. Think about this. The Republican party this year has no platform. No, I'm not—I'm not—I'm not joking. There is no place you can go and get the Republican platform.
Look what they're doing with the bipartisan immigration border law. We worked for 5 months to get that. The border is in chaos. The border—and the first bill I ever introduced as a—as President of the United States was on the border, on immigration. We need somewhere in an order—in excess of 2,000 additional personnel at the border—from judges to ICE to just the Border Patrol. They don't have the personnel.
And by the way, the idea the Border Patrol endorsed me this time out, if I'm so—so much of chaos. [Laughter] Well, look—and so we came up with a proposal. It did everything I wanted, and I promised I'd come back for it. It didn't deal with the issue—which I think we should be dealing with—which has to do with minors who have come here. Anyway. I won't go into it.
But there's—we can all—we can pick that all up. But in the meantime, we've got to get the personnel at the border. They won't even give us the money for the technology to identify the fentanyl that's coming through. We have machines that can determine and find it.
Look, you know, and it looked like it was going to pass—pass through the Senate. You know what Trump did? I'm told he was on the telephone calling House Members, threatening with retribution if they voted for it. Why? Because, quote, ""It would help Biden.""
Like I said, I've been around a long time, but I don't ever remember a time when the opposition was driven by the prospect, even if it's a good proposal, that ""Don't do it because it would help the incumbent President.""
Look what they're doing to the national security supplemental. That's that—I used the Senate terms; I shouldn't—some of the money for Ukraine, Israel, and the Palestinian people. The Palestinian people need more help. And they're doing nothing. Won't even let it come up for a vote. Why? Because Donald Trump tells them not to do it.
It's outrageous. He's even gone further. And I—when I—I knew this, but when I said it before, people looked at me like I was crazy until it got all over television. He invites Putin to invade NATO countries—to invade NATO—do whatever the hell you want, take them down if you're not paying your dues.
He has no notion of history. Imagine, had we had—not had NATO the last seven decades, what would be—what would be the situation in Europe now. We need it as badly as Europe needs it. It's crazy.
The bottom line is, Republicans have to decide who they serve. Do they serve Donald Trump, or do they serve the American people? Are they here to solve problems or just to weaponize them as political issues? Because that's literally what it's come to. I'm not—not a joke. Not a joke.
There's still a lot of good Republicans. This is not your father's Republican Party, though. There's a lot of good Republicans in the Senate—House and Senate. I've had seven—I will not name them; I promised I never would, and I won't. Over the last 3 years, seven Senators I worked with when I was a Senator have come in saying, ""Joe""—individually—""Joe, I agree with you, but I can't—I can't do it because they'll primary me, and I'll be lost."" It does not say much about political courage, but it says about what the state of the party is right now.
Look, I'm here and you're here helping out to serve the American people. It sounds ridiculous to have to say that. When we make it clear—we're going to make that actually clear to the American people, we're going to win.
Just look at 2020. In 2020, we were supposed to get shellacked. Remember? And I made that speech that became very famous at the Independence Hall about democracy being at stake. And the press, who's in the room here, a lot of them asked, ""What's he talking about democracy for?"" Well, 66 percent of the American people agree with me: It's at stake. It's at stake.
Twenty-twenty-two, we were supposed to get blistered. Remember? In the off year, the only—we were the only—of all the Presidents who, in an off year for them, didn't lose. Remember the red wave was coming? Well, guess what? The lowest amount of wins for the party that's out of office in—I think, ever, but I don't want to—I can't guarantee that—but than anybody ever thought.
Twenty-twenty-three, we were supposed to clobbered. We won every critical race out there but one—every one: Governors, Senators, as well as off-year elections that occurred.
Look, this gets me to my final point. We can't take anything for granted. Trump and his friends are doing one thing: deliberately trying to divide us. It's about dividing the country.
When I ran the first time, I said I was running for 3 years—for three reasons in my first term out. I said I was running because I wanted to restore the soul of the Nation. That wasn't hyperbole. I meant the sense of decency and honor, being able to know what your leaders are telling you are truthful.
I said, secondly, I want to do—I want to run for a second reason: because I want to change the dynamic of how we build the middle class. Because when you build the middle class, everybody does well. I was tired of trickle-down economics.
A lot of you are economists and run multibillion-dollar companies. Name me a time when you thought we were going to be as well off in terms of economics as we are today. Raise your hand if you thought, like I thought from the beginning, we would not have a recession, that we would be, in fact—I won't go through it all.
But the fact of the matter is, when you build from the middle out and the bottom up, the poor have a shot, the middle class do well, and the wealthy still very, very well.
You know, these guys want to drag us back to the future. I'm trying to pull us into—I mean, excuse me—drive us back to the past. I want to pull us into the future.
Refusing to accept the results of the last election, still; seeking, as Trump says, to, quote, ""terminate"" elements of the Constitution. He is saying it out loud—terminate elements—he thinks he has the right to terminate elements of the Constitution.
He embraces political violence. No president since the Civil War has done that: embracing it, encouraging it. You saw what he did, he—with the January 6 insurrectionists. He calls them ""patriots"" and saying, if he gets elected, he's going to pardon them all. These guys killed cops. They killed people.
I was at the first meeting of the G-7 with the European leaders when—in February after I got elected. And I sat down, and I was sitting next to Macron. And I said, ""Well, America is back."" He looked at me and said, ""For how long, Joe?"" Not a joke.
The German Chancellor spoke up and said: ""Joe, what would you say if tomorrow we picked up the London Times and you read in London that they broke down the doors of the Parliament to stop the election of a Prime Minister, and three bobbies were killed? What would you think?"" What would we think? I mean, just put yourself—what would we think?
We are the leader of the free world, God darn it. We are looked to. [Applause] No, I mean it. We are. The rest of the world looks to us. They look to us.
Doesn't mean we have the responsibility of doing everything, but we have a responsibility of doing what we can, and we can do more than any other country can.
When he calls immigrants the ""vermin"" who poison the blood of the country, threatening our very democracy, as he says. Folks, no wonder the survey of 150 Presidential scholars done a couple of weeks ago rates him as the worst President in American history. These are Presidential scholars, Presidential historians.
Look, folks, we have to make it clear that the America we believe in still believes in honesty, still believes in decency and dignity, respect. We believe everyone deserves just a fair shot—no guarantees, just a fair shot—an even opportunity. We leave nobody behind.
My dad, who was a really well read man—he got into Johns Hopkins when he was out—getting out of school, but the war came along so he never went. My dad used to have an expression. I mean this; I give you my word as a Biden. He'd say: ""Joey, remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and believe he has a shot.""
Where's the dignity and respect shown to working people in this country until recently? Where is it?
You know, in America, we've never before given hate to safe harbor. This guy gives safe—safe harbor.
And as I said earlier, I believe in science. You believe in science. This guy—we've made more progress in 3 years than most Presidents have made in 8, so far, with your help and with the help of a lot of smart people in my administration. But it can all be wiped out. Not hyperbole. It can all be wiped out in this election.
So we have to stay focused on what we do—have to do to win. We have to get out the vote. We have to keep the White House, we have to keep the Senate, and we have—must bring—win back the House.
If we do that, we can say something that few generations of electors have ever been able to say: We will have saved democracy.
I'm tempted to go on, but I won't.
Here's the deal. Think about it. Think about what happens if Donald Trump wins this election. Think about all the things you've worked for. Not a joke. Just ask any of the MAGA Republicans who are out there.
And by the way, not all Republicans—a lot of decent Republicans—Republican Senators and Congressmen, Governors. But these guys, they control the party. About 32 percent of them control it. If they win, it's a different world.
Katie, there's two of your former colleagues—not at the same network—who have told me personally that, if he wins, they have to leave the country because he has threatened to put them in jail for things they've—he's—they've said about him. This is the United States of America.
So, folks, we just remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America—the United States of America. There is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity, not a damn thing in—when we all work together—not a damn thing. And that's not hyperbole.
As I said earlier, name me a country that's come out of every crisis stronger than it went in, other than the United States. Name me one. Name me one.
So, folks, we have enormous opportunities—enormous, enormous opportunities. And I'm not the gift of all Presidents, but I'm sure in hell better than the last guy. [Laughter]
Thank you very much."""

"Feb 26, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-seth-meyers-nbcs-late-night,"Interview with Seth Meyers on NBC's ""Late Night""","""THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody.
MEYERS: Welcome back, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: It's good to be back. Why haven't you invited me earlier?
MEYERS: Well, you know, you're a busy guy. Did you think when you were here in 2014, this show would make it 10 years?
THE PRESIDENT: No.
MEYERS: Yeah. We appreciate -- we appreciate the honesty, you know. Now, you guys actually -- you've been colleagues before. You worked together. You did an episode of Parks and Recreation. We talked about it back in 2000.
THE PRESIDENT: Are you kidding me? I bragged about that all for a long, long time.
AMY POEHLER: That was really fun.
MEYERS: That was -- before president, this was the best gig you ever had.
THE PRESIDENT: And maybe the best gig I ever had, period.
MEYERS: Yeah. How was -- Amy, how was -- how was the president as a scene partner?
POEHLER: Well, it was an awesome time to go to DC because we met with the then Mr. Vice President -- Mr. President Vice President President.
MEYERS: That is right.
POEHLER: I don't want to get it wrong.
THE PRESIDENT: No. No.
POEHLER: I don't want to get it wrong. But we met people from both sides of the aisle. And then if you remember, we did that scene together, and then you said to me, how should I act? And I said, just act like what is this lady doing here? And you nailed it.
MEYERS: There's something that I've been very -- it just speaks to the air we live in now. There's a Dark Brandon conspiracy meme, and this is something that you seem to have a lot of fun with. You've co-opted. You've co-opted Dark Brandon. This is a yard sign. And do you enjoy playing around with the Dark Brandon meme?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I resent the hell out of it.
MEYERS: OK. Now, I want -- my favorite one recently is there are 18% of Americans, according to recent polling, have believe that you and Taylor Swift are actually working in cahoots. And after the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl, you -- you posted this on social media and wrote -- you wrote ""Just like we drew it up."" Now, can you -- I have you on the hotspot here. Can you confirm or deny that there is an active conspiracy between you and Ms. Swift?
THE PRESIDENT: Where are you getting this information? It's classified.
MEYERS: It's classified information?
THE PRESIDENT: That's classified information.
MEYERS: You won't share it with us.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to. But I will tell you, she did endorse me in 2020.
MEYERS: She did. You might be wondering -- might be wondering, you think it might come around again?
THE PRESIDENT: I told you, it's classified.
MEYERS: I'm going to -- I'm going to ask you another question because we mentioned Parks and Rec, and Parks and Rec was a show that was about how government could actually help people. And it was a really optimistic show. Real quick, though. Well, do you believe any conspiracy theories, Amy?
POEHLER: Oh, yeah. I do have one conspiracy. I think that octopus -- an octopus is an alien.
MEYERS: OK.
POEHLER: And the bottom of the sea floor is actually the top of the Earth.
MEYERS: He's leaving. He's got to go.
POEHLER: Wait. Wait. Hey.
MEYERS: I told you to stop telling people that.
POEHLER: So, if that's wrong, don't spoil it for me.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not. I'm not.
MEYERS: All right. So, Parks and Rec was about optimism. You, I believe, are more optimistic about this country than certainly I am, than a lot of people are. Why do you continue to be optimistic about this nation despite everything that's happened in recent years?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, I tell every world leader, and I mean this sincerely, never underestimate the ability of the American people. There's nothing beyond our capacity. Nothing. Think about it. Every single crisis we've ever, ever, ever been in, we've come out stronger than we went in. Everyone. And folks, it's because of you, not because of your leaders. Because of you, really and truly. The American people are incredible. And we're the -- you know, I've told -- I asked -- I was asked by Xi Jinping about -- when I was in the Tibetan mountains with him, and he said can you define America for me? I said, yeah, one word, possibilities. America believes anything is possible. And by the way, people step up -- people here step up. And look what's happening. We've got the best economy in the world. Now, we've got a long way to go, but the best in the world now, and we're going to get it better.
MEYERS: Well, I have a lot more to ask you about what's coming up next. You, guys, that's President Joe Biden. That's Amy Poehler. We'll be right back with more from President Biden.
[commercial break]
MEYERS: Welcome back to Late Night. We're here with President Joe Biden. You mentioned some classified materials, some documents recently leaked, some classified documents. And this isn't a gotcha show, but I do want to ask about it that says you are currently 81 years old.
THE PRESIDENT: Who the hell told you that?
MEYERS: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: That's classified.
MEYERS: That's classified. All jokes aside, according to recent polling, this is a real concern for American voters. How do you address that concern going forward as you come up to the 2024 election?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, a couple of things. Number one, you got to take a look at the other guy. He's about as old as I am, but he can't even remember his wife's name.
MEYERS: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: And -- number one. Number two, it's about how old your ideas are. Look, I mean, this is a guy who wants to take us back. He wants to take us back in Roe v. Wade. He wants to take us back on a whole range of issues that are 50, 60 years. They've been solid American positions. And -- and I really mean this sincerely. The -- I think it's about -- about the future. And everything -- every single thing we've done, I think we've gotten some good things done. Everything -- and they told us we couldn't get them done because things were so divided. And -- but I think everything -- everything we've gotten done, he's just frontally stated he wants to do away with if he gets elected. And I really think his views on where to take America are older than -- anyway, I don't want to get called.
MEYERS: You talked about bipartisanship and that you could actually work across the aisle when you ran in 2020. I was one of the people who thought that was maybe a foolish proposition. But you have gotten things done: Infrastructure, CHIPS, Inflation Reduction Act, some gun safety. You even got an immigration bill that passed in the Senate but never got taken up in the House.
THE PRESIDENT: It will be.
MEYERS: And what do you would you want to do? What's your 2024 agenda? Because I feel like we live in such crazy times that that is one of the things I feel we hear less about.
THE PRESIDENT: Look, the 2020 agenda is to finish the job. For example, we're now in a position where we have the strongest economy of any major nation in the world, number one. We've got a way to go yet. Inflation is down, 880,000 manufacturing jobs. You know, we have some 14 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been for the longest time. We're building wealth for people. But it really -- we have to do more. The first thing I have to do is stop it from being turned around. For example, you -- you talked about the border, it didn't pass. Well, guess what? We're going to pass that border. It's overwhelmingly -- overwhelmingly supported by Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate. But because, I don't know this for a fact, but I was told that Trump was picking up the phone, calling the speaker of the House, saying don't let it pass. Why? Not because he doesn't think it's good. Because it will benefit Biden. That's no way to run a country. That's no way to deal. We didn't even -- when we had real divisions back when I was a young senator among Democrats and Republicans, that -- that -- that wasn't the way it worked. And look, I think -- let me put this, it's not your father's Republican Party. This is -- they got about 30% of the Republican Party controlling it all. And -- and I think it's -- we're going to break it.
MEYERS: One of the things about this is not your father's Republican Party, it must be for somebody who's been doing this as long as you have. You can't get aid for Ukraine passed. And it seemed like for a long time, the American people agreed that Russia was a threat. And all of a sudden, now, you see a Republican Party that is basically refusing to aid Ukraine in their fight. Again, it seems like Donald Trump is saying Russia can do whatever they want to NATO countries. Are you shocked?
THE PRESIDENT: Not seems like, that's what he is saying. He's been saying it all along. He'd been saying it when he ran the last time. Look, the idea that any American -- think about this, if I told you all there was going to be an American president who said to Putin, Putin, come do whatever you want and -- to -- to NATO if they don't -- if the other guys on our team don't pay up every single cent they promised to pay for. I mean, what are we talking about here? What in God's name? How -- the idea that the president of the United States is inviting Vladimir Putin to invade Eastern or Western countries is bizarre. Absolutely bizarre. And it's totally against our interests. And by the way, I've known every major foreign leader for the longest time, and I know all these guys extremely well. They're scared to death of what it means for them -- for them, what it means if we walk away. Madeleine Albright was right, the former secretary of state. She said we are the essential nation. We are the essential nation. We don't have people fighting in those areas, but we're providing the wherewithal for them to be able to protect themselves. And it's just outrageous what he's talking about.
MEYERS: He talked about how he wants to be a dictator on day one, but only on day one. You were someone who has dealt with dictators over the years. It does seem as though democracy in vague terms somehow is not easy for us to grasp. Having dealt with dictators, what do you see in a world where democracy is actually at risk in a way it might be in this election?
THE PRESIDENT: The first thing they do -- dictators do is they disregard whatever the rule of law is. They just disregard it. Here's the guy who says he wants to -- he thinks he can change the Constitution and ignore it. Just ignore portions of the Constitution. Here's the guy who talks about retribution. Here's the guy -- look, you have the guys -- the thousands of people who stormed the Capitol -- stormed the Capitol.
MEYERS: They're insurrectionists. Two cops died. Other people were badly hurt. And what did he say? They got convicted and/or they pled guilty, and he said they're patriots. God. Patriots? And he says he's going to forgive them all. He's going to -- and he's going to -- every one of them is going to be released.
THE PRESIDENT: What is -- I mean, that -- that's what happens in Eastern European countries. That's not what happens in America. We're -- and the idea that he thinks he can do that. The idea -- he talks about things like, for example, the idea that he said the Congress wants to pass an overwhelmingly a border provision that would allow us to control the border. The first bill I've ever introduced called for that. And here, they're saying, he's saying, no, don't do that because that'll help Biden. Help Biden? It's about -- not about Biden. It's about the United States of America. And look, it just -- I don't want to get started. I really don't.
MEYERS: Yeah. I get it. I get it.
THE PRESIDENT: Our Democracy is at stake. It literally is.
MEYERS: I want to ask about the situation right now in the Middle East. You have forcefully spoken about the horrible events of October 7th and how Hamas is continuing threat to the safety of the people who live in Israel. You've been negotiating -- trying to negotiate the release of the hostages. At the same time, you've said that the response in Gaza is too much and that the loss of an innocent life in Gaza is just as horrible as the loss of an innocent life in Israel. And yet, there have been calls for an immediate cease-fire. You have not supported those calls. Again, you seem like an optimistic person. You believe maybe there's a future for a two-state solution. But from where I'm sitting, it does seem like there doesn't seem to be any appetite for that right now. Do you see -- what is -- because again, we see this horrible -- every day, we see these horrible images out of Gaza. And is there a path forward? Is there a safe future for the people who live there?
THE PRESIDENT: There is a path forward with difficulty. But here's the path forward. Look, first of all, there are -- the hostages being held must be released. And then we've got -- and it's an in-principle agreement, there will be a cease-fire while that takes place. Ramadan is coming up, and there's been an agreement by the Israelis that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan as well in order to give us time to get all the hostages out. That gives us time to begin to move in directions that a lot of Arab countries are prepared to move in. For example, Saudi Arabia is ready to recognize Israel. Jordan is -- Egypt. There are six other states I've been working with. Qatar. And the bottom line is that I'm not -- I think the only way Israel ultimately survives, and I make no bones about it, I get criticized for having said a long time ago, you need not be a Jew to be a Zionist. I'm a Zionist. Where there's no Israel, there's not a Jew in the world who'll be safe. But here's the deal. They also have to make up -- take advantage of an opportunity to have peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians who are being used as pawns by -- by the -- by Hamas. And so, there's a process underway that I think if we get that -- that temporary cease-fire, we're going to be able to move in a direction where we can change the dynamic and not have a two-state solution immediately, but a process to get to a two-state solution. A process to guarantee Israel's security and the independence of the Palestinians, but without them being able to, for example, invite in a, you know, another country to provide their defenses. There's ways to do this, and I don't have time to go into it now. But -- and in the meantime, there are too many innocent people that are being killed. And Israel has slowed down the attacks in Rafah. They have to -- and they've made a commitment to me they're going to see to it that there's an ability to evacuate significant portions of Rafah before they go and take out the remainder of Hamas. But -- but it's a process. And look, Israel has had the overwhelming support of the vast majority of nations. If it keeps this up without this incredibly conservative government they have, and Ben-Gvir and others, most -- I've known every major foreign policy leader in Israel since Golda Meir. They're going to lose support from around the world, and that is not in Israel's interest.
MEYERS: Well, I wish you the best of luck with that because they are really horrifying scenes, and I'm happy to hear you agree with that as well. I do want to close by thanking you for something. When you were here in 2014, you gave me two gifts. First, you gave me an Amtrak whistle. And -- and it was 10 years ago. I didn't have kids yet. And I have kids now, and it's their favorite thing and they blow it all the time, and it's really irritating. So, I want to give it back. And --
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to take it back. We're going to give it to your kids.
MEYERS: It's covered with germs. I'll say you gave me this -- this conductor's hat and this meant the world to me because when I put it on, I realized that you didn't just buy this at a store. You obviously went out of your way. You got my hat size, because when I put it on, it was such a perfect fit. And --
THE PRESIDENT: Let's get moving.
MEYERS: Let's get moving. I really want to thank you so much for being here, Mr. President. It means the world to celebrate the anniversary with you. That's President Joe Biden, everybody. We'll be right back with more Late Night."""
"Feb 27, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-congressional-leaders-13,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders,"""The President. All right. Well, thank you all for being here.
Look, I want to thank the leaders for being here today. We've got a lot of work to do. We've got to figure out how we're going to keep funding the Government, which is an important problem, an important solution we need to find. And I think we can do that.
And—Ukraine—I think the need is urgent. I hope we get to speak to that a little bit. And I think the consequence of inaction every day in Ukraine are dire. I've been speaking to some of our—G-7 partners. And you just got back, Chuck.
Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer. I did. I did. Yes.
The President. They're very concerned.
And—also, we need to—in terms of the supplemental, we need to deal with the Israeli portion. But that also contains a significant portion having to do with humanitarian assistance into the Palestinian area, which I think is important.
And we have to replenish the air defenses for Israel, and we have to work on making sure they don't face the threat from—they can face the threat from the—from what's going on in the Middle East, not just from Hamas, but from Iran.
And so—and Government funding, I'm sure you guys had all—that all taken care of. But all kidding aside, I think that it's Congress's responsibility to fund the Government. We've got to get about doing it. A shutdown would damage the economy significantly, and I think we all agree to that. And we need bipartisan solutions.
So I want to hear from the group. And I want to hear from all of you here. So thank you all for coming. And that's what we're going to be talking about. Thank you.

That's good news for the American people. But I want to be clear: This is a short-term fix, not a long-term solution.
In the days ahead, Congress must do its job and pass full-year funding bills that deliver for the American people. And House Republicans must act on the bipartisan national security supplemental, which already passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support and would pass the House if it was brought to a vote.
During my meeting with congressional leaders this week, we all agreed on the vital importance of supporting Ukraine. That understanding must now be backed with action. Every day that House Republicans refuse to hold a vote on the bipartisan national security supplemental, the consequences for Ukraine grow more severe.
In addition to arming Ukraine as they defend against Russian attacks every single day, this bill will help ensure that Israel can defend itself against Hamas and other threats. And it will provide critical humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people and those impacted by conflicts around the world. Because the truth is, the aid flowing into Gaza is nowhere near enough and nowhere fast enough. Innocent lives are on the line.

"Mar 01, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-meeting-with-prime-minister-giorgia-meloni-italy-0,Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy,"""President Biden. Well, Prime Minister Meloni, thank you for being here again. And I have to admit to you, as she walked in the door—we're good friends—and I played Ray Charles's ""Georgia"" as she walked in the door. Now, most of you don't know Ray Charles's ""Georgia,"" but anyway.
Look, Italy and the United States are strong allies and really close friends. And as you said when we first met here in the Oval, Giorgia, that we have each other's backs. And we do. And you've demonstrated that from the moment you took office.
And we also have Ukraine's back. That's why I'm urging the House of Representatives to pass the legislation that allows us to, in a bipartisan way, continue to support Ukraine now. They need the security bill now. And the bill includes funding for Ukraine so we can help keep Putin from—his onslaught from succeeding in Ukraine.
And I want to thank you, Giorgia, for Italy's unwavering support for Ukraine and your leadership of the G-7 this year.
Today, also, we're going to discuss the Middle East and yesterday's tragic and alarming event in North Gaza trying to get humanitarian assistance in there. And the loss of life is heartbreaking. People are so desperate that innocent people got caught in a terrible war, unable to feed their families. And you saw the response when they tried to get aid in.
And we need to do more, and the United States will do more. In the coming days, we're going to join with our friends in Jordan and others in providing airdrops of additional food and supplies into Ukraine [Gaza; White House correction] and seek to continue to open up other avenues into Ukraine [Gaza; White House correction], including the possibility of a marine corridor to deliver large amounts of humanitarian assistance.
In addition to expanding deliveries by land, as I said, we're going to insist that Israel facilitate more trucks and more routes to get more and more people the help they need. No excuses. Because the truth is, aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough now. It's nowhere nearly enough.
Innocent lives are on the line, and children's lives are on the line, and we won't stand by and let—until they—until we get more aid in there. Because we should be getting hundreds of trucks in, not just several.
And I won't stand by, we won't let up, and we're not going to pull out—trying to pull out every stop we can to get more assistance in.
So—and here's the deal: We've been working, and hopefully, we'll know shortly. And I know you've been informed: We're trying to work out a deal between Israel and Hamas on the hostages being returned and the immediate cease-fire in Gaza for at least the next 6 weeks and to allow the surge of aid through the entire Gaza Strip—not just the south, but the entire Gaza Strip.
And so, Giorgia, we have a lot to discuss today. Not—and then we'll talk about everything from China on. But I'm happy you're here and delighted to—that you came back. I know you're on your way to Canada, right?
Prime Minister Meloni. Yes.
President Biden. Well, good. The floor is yours, Madam.
Prime Minister Meloni. Well, I'm delighted to be here today in my capacity as the G-7 chair, and I look forward, Joe, to hosting you in Puglia next June for the leaders summit. I'm working on a concrete and substantial G-7 summit.
We intend, first and foremost, to reaffirm the rules-based international order, defending freedom and building peace for Ukraine. And, in doing this, I think we need to tackle the narrative that wants the West against the rest. So the dialogue—our dialogue within the G-7, within the Global South is essential.
The crisis in Middle East is of the utmost concern. We need to coordinate our actions in order to avoid an escalation. And, in this regard, we do fully support the U.S. mediation efforts.
The humanitarian crisis is our number-one priority. Italy is concentrating its contribution on this. Meanwhile, we are cooperating with all regional actors that must be part of any future outcome.
We should work together on concrete steps to guarantee the two-state perspective, which is the only long-term, sustainable solution.
And then the Houthis' attack on commercial vessels that endanger freedom of navigation in the Red Sea are unacceptable. EU naval Operation Aspides, this—as you know, is under Italian tactical command, is an important response to the disruption of transit through the Red Sea.
Then, building on Italy's role in the Mediterranean, the G-7 will pay special attention also to the African Continent. We've been discussing it for—many times. But I think we have to remember that Africa is not a poor continent; it is, at the contrary, incredibly rich in human and material resources. But it has been neglected and exploited with a predatory approach for a long time. And I want to reverse this approach, together with you, which is also a root cause of the migration crisis.
We need to support Africa's development on an equal basis and put an end to illegal migration while fighting human trafficking. Human trafficking has become the most financially rewarding crime globally, and we cannot accept it no—any longer. For this reason, I came here today also with a proposal to launch a global alliance against human traffickers.
The G-7 will discuss artificial intelligence as well. AI is a means. It can be a good or a bad one; it depends on our capacity to govern it, to tackle the risks and the impact it can have, for example, on the labor market. We want to develop AI, but, also, we want to be certain that it remains human centered.
And then, last but not least, I came here to boost our strategic cooperation. And our relations are enriched by the presence of more than 20 million Italian Americans.
During our last meeting here in Washington, we said we wanted to improve our bilateral cooperation and our trade, and we did it. For, in 2023, our bilateral trade reached the highest amount ever with $102 billion of exchange.
So I think we did a good job, but I also think that we can do even better. And I hope this will be our mutual goal for this year.
Thank you, Joe.
President Biden. Well, it is. And I tried to help; I married an Italian American. [Laughter]
So thank you all very much."""

The President. Your bedtime reading.
Tony! Thank you. Looking for Jill.
Good evening. Good evening. If I were smart, I'd go home now. [Laughter]
Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: In January 1941, Franklin Roosevelt came to this Chamber to speak to the Nation. And he said, ""I address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union."" Hitler was on the march. War was raging in Europe. President Roosevelt's purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time. Freedom and democracy were under assault in the world.
Tonight I come to the same Chamber to address the Nation. Now it's we who face an unprecedented moment in the history of the Union. And yes, my purpose tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either. Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault at home as they are today.
What makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack at—both at home and overseas at the very same time. Overseas, Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond. If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you: He will not.
But Ukraine—[applause]. Ukraine can stop Putin. Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself. That is all—that is all—Ukraine is asking. They're not asking for American soldiers. In fact, there are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine, and I'm determined to keep it that way.
But now assistance to Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership. It wasn't long ago when a Republican President named Ronald Reagan thundered, ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."" Now—[applause]. Now my predecessor, a former Republican President, tells Putin, quote, ""Do whatever the hell you want.""
Audience members. Boo!
The President. That's a quote. A former President actually said that, bowing down to a Russian leader. I think it's outrageous, it's dangerous, and it's unacceptable.
America is a founding member of NATO, the military alliance of democratic nations created after World War II prevent—to prevent war and keep the peace. And today we've made NATO stronger than ever. We welcomed Finland to the alliance last year. And just this morning Sweden officially joined, and their Minister is here tonight. Come here, stand up. Welcome. Welcome, welcome, welcome. And they know how to fight.
Mr. Prime Minister, welcome to NATO, the strongest military alliance the world has ever seen.
I say this to Congress: We have to stand up to Putin. Send me a bipartisan national security bill. History is literally watching. History is watching. If the United States walks away, it will put Ukraine at risk. Europe is at risk. The free world will be at risk, emboldening others to do what they wish to do us harm.
My message to President Putin, who I've known for a long time, is simple: We will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down.
In a literal sense, history is watching. History is watching, just like history watched 3 years ago on January 6, when insurrectionists stormed this very Capitol and placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy.
Many of you were here on that darkest of days. We all saw with our own eyes, the insurrectionists were not patriots. They had come to stop the peaceful transfer of power, to overturn the will of the people.
January 6 lies about the 2020 election and the plots to steal the election posed a great—gravest threat to U.S. democracy since the Civil War. But they failed. America stood—[applause]. America stood strong, and democracy prevailed. We must be honest: The threat to democracy must be defended [defeated; White House correction].
My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6. I will not do that. This is a moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. Here's the simple truth: You can't love your country only when you win.
As I've done ever since being elected to office, I ask all of you, without regard to party, to join together and defend democracy. Remember your oath of office to defend against all threats foreign and domestic. Respect—respect—free and fair elections, restore trust in our institutions, and make clear political violence has absolutely no place—no place—in America. Zero place.
Again, it's not hyperbole to suggest history is watching. They're watching. Your children and grandchildren will read about this day and what we do.
History is watching another assault on freedom. Joining us tonight is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama.
Fourteen months ago—fourteen months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF. She scheduled treatments to have that second child, but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the State, unleashed by a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. She was told her dream would have to wait.
What her family had gone through should never have happened. Unless Congress acts, it could happen again. So tonight let's stand up for families like hers. To my friends across the aisle, don't keep this waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF. Guarantee it nationwide.
Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right.
I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader defending reproductive freedom and so much more. [Applause] Thank you.
My predecessor came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. He's the reason it was overturned, and he brags about it. Look at the chaos that has resulted.
Joining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother from Dallas. She'd become pregnant again and had a fetus with a fatal condition. Her doctor told Kate that her own life and her ability to have future in the—children in the future were at risk if she didn't act. Because Texas law banned her ability to act, Kate and her husband had to leave the State to get what she needed.
What her family had gone through should have never happened as well. But it's happening to too many others. There are State laws banning the freedom to choose, criminalizing doctors, forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their States to get the treatment they need.
Many of you in this Chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. My God, what freedom else would you take away?
Look, its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote the following—and with all due respect, Justices—""Women are not without electoral power""—excuse me—""electoral or political power."" You're about to realize just how much you were right about that.
Clearly—[applause]. Clearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women. But they found out. When reproductive freedom was on the ballot, we won in 2022 and 2023. And we'll win again in 2024.
If you—if you, the American people—send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again.
Folks, America cannot go back.
I am here tonight to show what I believe is the way forward, because I know how far we've come. Four years ago next week, before I came to office, the country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century. Remember the fear, record losses?
Remember the spikes in crime and the murder rate? A raging virus that took more than 1 million American lives of loved ones, millions left behind. A mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness.
A President, my predecessor, failed in the most basic Presidential duty that he owes to American people: the duty to care.
Representative Derrick Van Orden. Lies!
The President. I think that's unforgivable.
I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in the Nation's history. We have. It doesn't make new, but in a—news—in a thousand cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.
So let's tell the story here—tell it here and now. America's comeback is building a future of American possibilities; building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down; investing in all of America, in all Americans to make every—sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one—no one—behind.
The pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccine that saved us from COVID is—are now being used to beat cancer. Turning setback into comeback—that's what America does. That's what America does.
Folks, I inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now, our economy is literally the envy of the world: 15 million new jobs in just 3 years—a record, a record; unemployment at 50-year lows.
A record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses, and each one is a literal act of hope, with historic job growth and small-business growth for Black and Hispanics and Asian Americans. Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs in America and counting. Where is it written we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world? We are, and we will.
More people have health insurance today—[applause]. More people have health insurance today than ever before. The racial wealth gap is the smallest it's been in 20 years. Wages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent, the lowest in the world and tending [trending; White House correction] lower.
The landing is and will be soft. And now, instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we're exporting American products and creating American jobs, right here in America, where they belong.
And it takes time, but the American people are beginning to feel it. Consumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.
""Buy America"" has been the law of the land since the 1930s. Past administrations, including my predecessor—including some Democrats, as well, in the past—failed to buy American. Not anymore.
On my watch, Federal projects that you fund—like helping build American roads, bridges, and highways—will be made with American products and built by American workers, creating good-paying American jobs.
And thanks to our CHIPS and Science Act, the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before. During the pandemic, a shortage of semiconductors, chips that drove up the price of everything from cell phones to automobiles—and by the way, we invented those chips right here in America.
Well, instead of having to import them, instead of—private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America, creating tens of thousands of jobs, many of those jobs paying $100,000 a year and don't require a college degree.
In fact, my policies have attracted $650 billion in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America. And thanks—[applause]. And thanks to our bipartisan infrastructure law, 46,000 new projects have been announced all across your communities.
And by the way, I noticed some of you who've strongly voted against it are there cheering on that money coming in. [Laughter] And I like it. I'm with you. I'm with you. And if any of you don't want that money in your district, just let me know. [Laughter]
Modernizing our roads and bridges, ports and airports, public transit systems; removing poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of brain damage; providing affordable—affordable—high-speed internet for every American, no matter where you live—urban, suburban, or rural communities in red States and blue States; record investments in Tribal communities.
Because of my investment in family farms—[applause]—because I invested in family farms—led by my Secretary of Agriculture, who knows more about this than anybody I know—we're better able to stay in the family for the—those farms so their—and their children and grandchildren won't have to leave home to make a living. It's transformative.
The great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois. Home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years. Before I came to office, the plant was on its way to shutting down. Thousands of workers feared for their livelihoods. Hope was fading.
Then, I was elected to office, and we raised the Belvidere repeatedly with auto companies, knowing unions would make all the difference. The UAW worked like hell to keep the plant open and get these jobs back. And together, we succeeded.
Instead of auto factories shutting down, auto factories are reopening, and a new state-of-the-art battery factory is being built to power those cars there at the same—[applause]. Folks—[applause]. To the folks of Belvidere, I say: Instead of your town being left behind, your community is moving forward again. Because instead of watching auto jobs of the future go overseas, 4,000 union jobs with higher wages are building a future in Belvidere right here in America.
Here tonight is UAW President Shawn Fain, a great friend and a great labor leader. Shawn, where are you? Stand up. And Dawn—and Dawn Simms, a third-generation worker—UAW worker at Belvidere. Shawn, I was proud to be the first President to stand in the picket line. And today, Dawn has a good job in her hometown, providing stability for her family and pride and dignity as well.
Showing once again, Wall Street didn't build America. They're not bad guys. They didn't build it, though. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.
I say to the American people: When America gets knocked down, we get back up. We keep going. That's America. That's you, the American people. It's because of you America is coming back. It's because of you our future is brighter. It's because of you that tonight we can proudly say the state of our Union is strong and getting stronger.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Tonight—tonight, I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together, a future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations no longer get the—all the tax breaks.
And by the way, I understand corporations. I come from a State that has more corporations invested—[laughter]—than every one of your States in the State—the United States combined. And I represented it for 36 years. I'm not anticorporation.
But I grew up in a home where trickle-down economics didn't put much on my dad's kitchen table. That's why I determined to turn things around so the middle class does well. When they do well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.
And there's more to do to make sure you're feeling the benefits of all we're doing.
Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world. It's wrong, and I'm ending it. With a law that I proposed and signed—and not one of your Republican buddies work—voted for it—we finally beat Big Pharma. Instead of paying $400 a month or thereabouts for insulin with diabetes—and it only costs 10 bucks to make—they only get paid $35 a month now and still make a healthy profit.
And I want to—and what to do next, I want to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it—everyone.
For years, people have talked about it. But finally, we got it done and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices on prescription drugs, just like the VA is able to do for veterans.
That's not just saving seniors money. It's saving taxpayers money. We cut the Federal deficit by $160 billion, because Medicare will no longer have to pay those exorbitant prices to Big Pharma.
This year, Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis. It's now time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.
They're making a lot of money, guys. And they'll still be extremely profitable. It will not only save lives, it will save taxpayers another $200 billion.
Starting next year, the same law caps total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $200—at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $15,000. Now I want to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone.
Folks, I'm going to get in trouble for saying that, but any of you want to get in Air Force One with me and fly to Toronto, Berlin, Moscow—I mean, excuse me. [Laughter] Well, even Moscow, probably. [Laughter] And bring your prescription with you, and I promise you, I'll get it for you for 40-percent the cost you're paying now. Same company, same drug, same place.
Folks, the Affordable Care Act—the old ""Obamacare""—is still a very big deal. [Laughter] Over 100 million of you can no longer be denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition. But my predecessor and many in this Chamber want to take the—that prescription drug away by repealing Affordable Care Act.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. I'm not going to let that happen. We stopped you 50 times before, and we'll stop you again.
In fact, I'm not only protecting it, I'm expanding it. The—we enacted tax credits of $800 per person per year [to; White House correction] reduce health care costs for millions of working families. That tax credit expires next year. I want to make that savings permanent.
To state the obvious: Women are more than half of our population, but research on women's health has always been underfunded. That's why we're launching the first ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research, led by Jill—doing an incredible job as First Lady—to pass my plan for $12 billion to transform women's health research and benefit millions of lives all across America.
I know the cost of housing is so important to you. If inflation keeps coming down, mortgage rates will come down as well, and the Fed acknowledges that.
But I'm not waiting. I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next 2 years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgages when they buy their first home or trade up for a little more space. Just for 2 years.
And my administration is also eliminating title insurance [fees; White House correction] on federally backed mortgages. When you refinance your home, you can save $1,000 or more as a consequence.
For millions of renters, we're cracking down on big landlords who use antitrust law—using antitrust—who break antitrust laws—by price-fixing and driving up rents. We've cut redtape so builders can get federally financing, which is already helping build a record 1.7 million new house—housing units nationwide.
Now pass—[applause]—now pass [my plan; White House correction] and build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring those rents down.
To remain the strongest economy in the world, we need to have the best education system in the world. And I, like I suspect all of you, want to give a child—every child a good start by providing access to preschool for 3- and 4-years-old.
You know, I think I pointed out last year—[applause]. I think I pointed out last year that children coming from broken homes where there's no books, they're not read to, not spoken to very often start school—kindergarten or first grade hearing—having heard a million fewer words spoken.
Well, studies show that children who go to preschool are nearly 50-percent more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- and 4-year degree no matter what their background is.
I met a year and a half ago with the leaders of the Business Roundtable. They were mad that I was ever—angry—I—well, they were discussing—[laughter]—why I wanted to spend money on education.
I pointed out to them: As Vice President, I met with over eight—I think it was 182 of those folks—don't hold me to the exact number—and I asked them what they need most—the CEOs. And you've had the same experience on both sides of the aisle. They say, ""A better educated workforce,"" right?
So I looked at them. And I say: ""I come from Delaware. DuPont used to be the eighth largest corporation in the world. And every new enterprise they bought, they educated the workforce to that enterprise. But none of you do that anymore. Why are you angry with me providing you the opportunity for the best educated workforce in the world?""
And they all looked at me and said, ""I think you're right.""
I want to expand high-quality tutoring and summer learning to see that every child learns to read by third grade. I'm also connecting local businesses and high schools so students get hands-on experience and a path to a good-paying job whether or not they go to college.
And I want to make sure that college is more affordable. Let's continue increasing the Pell grants to working and middle class families and increase record investments in HBCUs and minority-serving institutions, including Hispanic institutions.
When I was told I couldn't universally just change the way in which we did—dealt with student loans, I fixed two student loan programs that already existed to reduce the burden of student debt for nearly 4 million Americans, including nurses, firefighters, and others in public service.
Like Keenan Jones, a public educator in Minnesota, who's here with us tonight. Keenan, where are you? Keenan, thank you. He's educated hundreds of students so they can go to college. Now he's able to help, after debt forgiveness, get his own daughter to college.
And, folks, look, such relief is good for the economy because folks are now able to buy a home, start a business, start a family.
And while we're at it, I want to give public school teachers a raise.
And by the way, the first couple of years, we cut the deficit.
Now let me speak to the question of fundamental fairness for all Americans. I've been delivering real results in fiscally responsible ways. We've already cut the Federal deficit—[laughter]. We've already cut the Federal deficit over $1 trillion.
I signed a bipartisan deal to cut another trillion dollars in the next decade. It's my goal to cut the Federal deficit another $3 trillion by making big corporations and the very wealthy finally beginning to pay their fair share.
Look, I'm a capitalist. If you want to make or can make a million or millions of bucks, that's great. Just pay your fair share in taxes.
A fair Tax Code is how we invest in things that make this country great: health care, education, defense, and so much more.
But here's the deal. The last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefit the top 1 percent—the very wealthy——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. ——and the biggest corporations—and exploded the Federal deficit.
They added more to the national debt than any Presidential term in American history. Check the numbers.
Folks at home, does anybody really think the Tax Code is fair?
Audience members. No!
The President. Do you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion tax break?
Audience members. No!
The President. I sure don't. I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in Federal taxes—nobody—not one penny. And they haven't yet.
In fact, the child tax credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in half. Restore that child tax credit. No child should go hungry in this country.
The way to make the Tax Code fair is to make big corporations and the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Remember in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion and paid zero in Federal income tax. Zero.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Not anymore.
Thanks to the law I wrote and we signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. But that's still less than working people pay in Federal taxes. It's time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every big corporation finally begins to pay their fair share.
I also want to end tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, private jets, massive executive pay when it was only supposed to be a million—a million dollars that could be deducted. They can pay them $20 million if they want, but deduct a million. End it now.
You know, there are 1,000 billionaires in America. You know what the average Federal tax is for those billionaires?
Audience member. Zero!
The President. No. [Laughter] They're making great sacrifices—8.2 percent.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. That's far less than the vast majority of Americans pay. No billionaire should pay a lower Federal tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, or a nurse.
I proposed a minimum tax for billionaires of 25 percent—just 25 percent. You know what that would raise? That would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years.
And imagine what that could do for America. Imagine a future with affordable childcare, millions of families can get what they need to go to work to help grow the economy. Imagine a future with paid leave, because no one should have to choose between working and taking care of their sick family member. Imagine—imagine—a future with home care and eldercare, and people's living with disabilities so they can stay in their homes and family caregivers can finally get the pay they deserve.
Tonight let's all agree once again to stand up for seniors. Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle want to put Social Security on the chopping block. If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age, I will stop you.
The working people—[applause]. The working people who built this country pay more into Social Security than millionaires and billionaires do. It's not fair.
We have two ways to go. Republicans can cut Social Security and give more tax breaks to the wealthy. I will——
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. That's the proposal. Oh, no? You guys don't want another $2 trillion tax cut?
Audience member. Liar!
The President. I kind of thought that's what your plan was. [Laughter] Well, that's good to hear. You're not going to cut another $2 trillion for the superwealthy? That's good to hear.
I'll protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share.
Look——
Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe!
The President. ——too many corporations raise prices to pad their profits, charging more and more for less and less. That's why we're cracking down on corporations that engage in price gouging and deceptive pricing, from food to health care to housing.
In fact, the snack companies think you won't notice if they change the size of the bag and put a hell of a lot fewer—[laughter]—same size bag—put fewer chips in it. No, I'm not joking. It's called ""shrink-flation."" Pass Bobby Casey's bill, and stop this. I really mean it.
You probably all saw that commercial on Snickers bars. [Laughter] And you get—you get charged the same amount, and you've got about, I don't know, 10-percent fewer Snickers in it. [Laughter]
Look, I'm also getting rid of junk fees, those hidden fees at the end of your bill that are there without your knowledge. My administration announced we're cutting credit card late fees from $32 to $8.
Banks and credit card companies are allowed to charge what it costs them to instigate the collection. And that's more—a hell of a lot like $8 than 30-some dollars.
But they don't like it. The credit card companies don't like it, but I'm saving American families $20 billion a year with all of the junk fees I'm eliminating. Folks at home, that's why the banks are so mad. It's $20 billion in profit.
I'm not stopping there. My administration has proposed rules to make cable, travel, utilities, and online ticket sellers tell you the total price up front so there are no surprises. It matters. It matters.
And so does this. In November, my team began serious negotiations with a bipartisan group of Senators. The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we've ever seen.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Oh, you don't think so?
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Oh, you don't like that bill—huh?—that conservatives got together and said was a good bill? I'll be darned. That's amazing.
That bipartisan bill would hire 1,500 more security agents and officers, 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backload of 2 million cases, 4,300 more asylum officers, and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years now. What are you against?
One hundred more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles smuggling fentanyl into America that's killing thousands of children.
This bill would save lives and bring order to the border. It would also give me and any new President new emergency authority to temporarily shut down the border when the number of migrants at the border is overwhelming.
The Border Patrol union has endorsed this bill.
[At this point, members of the audience spoke over the President.]
The Federal Chamber of Commerce has—yes, yes. You're saying ""no."" Look at the facts. [Laughter] I know—[applause]. I know you know how to read.
I believe that given the opportunity—for—a majority in the House and Senate would endorse the bill as well—a majority right now.
Audience member. Yes!
The President. But unfortunately, politics has derailed this bill so far.
I'm told my predecessor called Members of Congress in the Senate to demand they block the bill. He feels political win—he viewed it as a—it would be a political win for me and a political loser for him. It's not about him. It's not about me. I'd be a winner—not really. I——
Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. What about Laken Riley?
[Members of the audience spoke over the President.]
Audience members. Boo!
Rep. Greene. Say her name!
[The President held up a pin reading: ""Say Her Name, Laken Riley.""]
The President. Lanken—Lanken [Laken; White House correction] Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed.
Rep. Greene. By an illegal!
The President. By an illegal. That's right. But how many of thousands of people are being killed by legals?
[Members of the audience spoke over the President.]
To her parents, I say: My heart goes out to you. Having lost children myself, I understand.
But look, if we change the dynamic at the border—people pay people—people pay these smugglers 8,000 bucks to get across the border because they know if they get by—if they get by and let into the country, it's 6 to 8 years before they have a hearing. And it's worth the—taking the chance of the $8,000.
[Members of the audience spoke over the President.]
But—but—if it's only 6 months—6 weeks, the idea is it's highly unlikely that people will pay that money and come all that way knowing that they'll be—able to be kicked out quickly.
Folks, I would respectfully suggest to my friend in—my Republican friends owe it to the American people. Get this bill done. We need to act now.
Audience members. Get it done! Get it done! Get it done!
Audience member. Build the wall.
The President. And if my predecessor is watching: Instead of paying [playing; White House correction] politics and pressuring Members of Congress to block the bill, join me in telling the Congress to pass it. We can do it together. But that's what he apparently—here's what he will not do.
I will not demonize immigrants, saying they are ""poison in the blood of our country."" I will not separate families. I will not ban people because of their faith.
Unlike my predecessor, on my first day in office, I introduced a comprehensive bill to fix our immigration system. Take a look at it. It has all these and more: secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship for ""Dreamers,"" and so much more.
But, unlike my predecessor, I know who we are as Americans. We're the only nation in the world with a heart and soul that draws from old and new.
Home to Native Americans whose ancestors have been here for thousands of years. Home to people of every place—from every place on Earth. They came freely. Some came in chains. Some came when famine struck, like my ancestral family in Ireland. Some to flee persecution, to chase dreams that are impossible anywhere but here in America.
That's America. And we all come from somewhere, but we're all Americans.
Look, folks, we have a simple choice: We can fight about fixing the border, or we can fix it. I'm ready to fix it. Send me the border bill now.
Audience members. Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!
The President. A transformational history—moment in history happened 58—59 years ago today in Selma, Alabama. Hundreds of foot soldiers for justice marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, named after the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, to claim their fundamental right to vote.
They were beaten. They were bloodied and left for dead. Our late friend and former colleague John Lewis was on that march. We miss him.
But joining us tonight are other marchers, both in the gallery and on the floor, including Bettie Mae Fikes, known as the ""Voice of Selma."" The daughter of gospel singers and preachers, she sang songs of prayer and protest on that Bloody Sunday to help shake the Nation's conscience.
Five months later, the Voting Rights Act passed and was signed into law. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. But 59 years later, there are forces taking us back in time: voter suppression, election subversion, unlimited dark money, extreme gerrymandering.
John Lewis was a great friend to many of us here. But if you truly want to honor him and all the heroes who marched with him, then it's time to do more than talk. Pass the Freedom To Vote Act, the John Lewis Voting Right [Rights; White House correction] Act.
And stop—stop denying another core value of America: our diversity across American life. Banning books, it's wrong. Instead of erasing history, let's make history.
I want to protect fundamental rights. Pass the Equality Act. And my message to transgender Americans is, I have your back.
Pass the PRO Act for workers' rights. Raise the Federal minimum wage, because every worker has the right to a decent living more than eight—7 bucks an hour.
We're also making history by confronting the climate crisis, not denying it. I don't think any of you think there's no longer a climate crisis. At least, I hope you don't. [Laughter] I'm taking the most significant action ever on climate in the history of the world.
I'm cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030, creating tens of thousands of clean energy jobs, like the IBEW workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations; conserving 30 percent of America's lands and waters by 2030; and taking action on environmental justice—fenceline communities smothered by the legacy of pollution.
And patterned after the Peace Corps and AmericaCorps [AmeriCorps; White House correction], I launched the Climate Corps to put 20,000 young people to work in the forefront of our clean energy future. I'll triple that number in a decade.
To state the obvious, all Americans deserve the freedom to be safe. And America is safer today than when I took office.
The year before I took office, murder rates went up 30 percent.
Norco, CA, resident and Gold Star father Steven Nikoui. Remember Abbey Gate!
The President. Thirty percent, they went up——
Mr. Nikoui. United States Marines! Kareem Mae'Lee Nikoui!
The President. ——the biggest increase in history.
Mr. Nikoui. [Inaudible]
The President. It was then, through no—through my American Rescue Plan—which every American [Republican; White House correction] voted against, I might add—we made the largest investment in public safety ever.
Last year, the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history. Violent crime fell to one of its lowest levels in more than 50 years.
But we have more to do. We have to help cities invest in more community police officers, more mental health workers, more community violence intervention.
Give communities the tools to crack down on gun crime, retail crime, and carjacking. Keep building trust, as I've been doing, by taking executive action on police reform and calling for it to be the law of the land.
Directing my Cabinet to review the Federal classification of marijuana and expunging thousands of convictions for the mere possession, because no one should be jailed for simply using or have it on their record.
Take on crimes of domestic violence. I'm ramping up the Federal enforcement of the Violence Against Women Act that I proudly wrote when I was a Senator so we can finally—finally end the scourge against women in America.
There are other kinds of violence I want to stop. With us tonight is Jazmin whose 9-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmates and teachers in her elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.
Very soon after that happened, Jill and I went to Uvalde for a couple days. We spent hours and hours with each of the families. We heard their message so everyone in this room, in this Chamber could hear the same message.
The constant refrain—and I was there for hours, meeting with every family. They said, ""Do something."" ""Do something.""
Well, I did do something by establishing the first ever Office of Gun Violence Prevention in the White House, that the Vice President is leading the charge. Thank you for doing it.
Meanwhile—[applause]. Meanwhile, my predecessor told the NRA he's proud he did nothing on guns when he was President.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. After another shooting in Iowa recently, he said—when asked what to do about it, he said, just ""get over it."" That was his quote. Just ""get over it."" I say stop it. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I'm proud we beat the NRA when I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years because of this Congress. We now must beat the NRA again.
I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Pass universal background checks. None of this—none of this—I taught the Second Amendment for 12 years. None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.
[Members of the audience spoke over the President.]
You know, as we manage challenges at home, we're also managing crises abroad, including in the Middle East. I know the last 5 months have been gut-wrenching for so many people: for the Israeli people, for the Palestinian people, and so many here in America.
This crisis began on October 7 with a massacre by a terrorist group called Hamas, as you all know. One thousand two hundred innocent people—women and girls, men and boys—slaughtered after enduring sexual violence. The deadliest day of the—for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. And 250 hostages taken.
Here in this Chamber tonight are families whose loved ones are still being held by Hamas. I pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring every one of your loved ones home.
We also—we will also work around the clock to bring home Evan and Paul, Americans being unjustly detained by the Russians—and others around the world.
Israel has a right to go after Hamas. Hamas ended this conflict by releasing the hostages, laying down arms—could end it by releasing the hostages, laying down arms, and surrendering those responsible for October 7.
But Israel has a—excuse me. Israel has a added burden because Hamas hides and operates among the civilian population like cowards, under hospitals, daycare centers, and all the like.
Israel also has a fundamental responsibility, though, to protect innocent civilians in Gaza. This war has taken a greater toll on innocent civilians than all previous wars in Gaza combined. More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed——
Audience member. Says who?
The President. ——most of whom are not Hamas. Thousands and thousands of innocents—women and children. Girls and boys also orphaned.
Nearly 2 million more Palestinians under bombardment or displacement. Homes destroyed, neighborhoods in rubble, cities in ruin. Families without food, water, medicine. It's heartbreaking.
I've been working nonstop to establish an immediate cease-fire that would last for 6 weeks to get all the prisoners released—all the hostages released and to get the hostages home and ease the intolerable and—humanitarian crisis and build toward an enduring—a more—something more enduring.
The United States has been leading international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Tonight I'm directing the U.S. military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments carrying food, water, medicine, and temporary shelters.
No U.S. boots will be on the ground.
A temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day.
And Israel must do its part. Israel must allow more aid into Gaza and ensure humanitarian workers aren't caught in the crossfire. And they're announcing they're going to—they're going to have a crossing in Northern Gaza.
To the leadership of Israel, I say this: Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.
As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time. And I say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel, my entire career. No one has a stronger record with Israel than I do. I challenge any of you here. I'm the only American President to visit Israel in wartime.
But there is no other path that guarantees Israel's security and democracy. There is no other path that guarantees that Palestinians can live in peace with—with peace and dignity. And there is no other path that guarantees peace between Israel and all of its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, with whom I'm talking.
Creating stability in the Middle East also means containing the threat posed by Iran. That's why I built a coalition of more than a dozen countries to defend international shipping and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.
I've ordered strikes to degrade the Houthi capability and defend U.S. forces in the region. As Commander in Chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military personnel.
For years, I've heard many of my Republican and Democratic friends say that China is on the rise and America is falling behind. They've got it backwards. I've been saying it for over 4 years, even when I wasn't President.
America is rising. We have the best economy in the world. And since I've come to office, our GTB [GDP; White House correction] is up, our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade. And we're standing up against China's unfair economic practices.
We're standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. I've revitalized our partnership and alliance in the Pacific: India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Pacific Islands. I've made sure that the most advanced American technologies can't be used in China—not allowing to trade them there.
Frankly, for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that.
I want competition with China, not conflict. And we're in a stronger position to win the conflict [competition; White House correction] of the 21st century against China than anyone else for that matter—than at any time as well.
Here at home, I've signed over 400 bipartisan bills. But there's more to pass my unity agenda.
Strengthen penalties on fentanyl trafficking.
Audience member. Boo!
The President. You don't want to do that, huh? [Laughter]
Pass bipartisan privacy legislation to protect our children online.
Harness—[applause]. Harness the promise of AI to protect us from peril. Ban AI voice impersonations and more.
And keep our truly sacred obligation to train and equip those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't.
That's why, with the strong support and help of Denis and the VA, I signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever, helping millions of veterans exposed to toxins who now are battling more than 100 different cancers. Many of them don't come home, but we owe them and their families support.
And we owe it to ourselves to keep supporting our new health research agency called ARPA-H—and remind us—to remind us that we can do big things, like end cancer as we know it. And we will.
Let me close with this. [Applause] Yay! [Laughter] I know you don't want to hear anymore, Lindsey, but I've got to say a few more things. [Laughter]
I know I may not look like it, but I've been around a while. [Laughter] When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever.
I know the American story. Again and again, I've seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our Nation, between those who want to pull America back to the past and those who want to move America into the future.
My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy, a future based on core values that have defined America—honesty, decency, dignity, and equality—to respect everyone; to give everyone a fair shot; to give hate no safe harbor.
Now, other people my age see it differently. [Laughter] The American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution.
That's not me. I was born amid World War II, when America stood for the freedom of the world. I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, among working class people who built this country.
I watched in horror as two of my heroes—like many of you did—Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy, were assassinated. And their legacies inspired me to pursue a career of service.
I left a law firm and became a public defender because my city of Wilmington was the only city in America occupied by the National Guard after Dr. King was assassinated because of the riots. And I became a county councilman almost by accident.
I got elected to the United States Senate when I had no intention of running, at age 29. Then Vice President to our first Black President. Now a President to the first woman Vice President. In my career, I've been told I was too young. [Laughter] By the way, they didn't let me on the Senate elevators for votes sometimes. They—not a joke. [Laughter]
And I've been told I am too old. [Laughter] Whether young or old, I've always been known—I've always known what endures. I've known our North Star. The very idea of America is that we're all created equal—deserves to be treated equally throughout our lives.
We've never fully lived up to that idea, but we've never walked away from it either. And I won't walk away from it now.
I'm optimistic. I really am. I'm optimistic, Nancy.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. My fellow Americans, the issue facing our Nation isn't how old we are, it's how old are our ideas.
Hate, anger, revenge, retribution are the oldest of ideas. But you can't lead America with ancient ideas that only take us back. To lead America, the land of possibilities, you need a vision for the future and what can and should be done.
Tonight you've heard mine. I see a future where [we're; White House correction] defending democracy, you don't diminish it. I see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect our freedoms, not take them away. I see a future where the middle class has—finally has a fair shot and the wealthy have to pay their fair share in taxes. I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
Above all, I see a future for all Americans. I see a country for all Americans. And I will always be President for all Americans because I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. You're the reason we've never been more optimistic about our future than I am now.
So let's build the future together. Let's remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you."""

A Proclamation
Today—and every day—the United States reaffirms our sacred pledge to American hostages and detainees wrongfully held abroad: We see you. We stand with you. We will not stop working until you are home and reunited with your family.
This has been a priority for my Administration since day one—and we have made important progress. Over the last 3 years, we have brought home more than 60 Americans being held hostage or wrongfully detained around the world, including from Afghanistan, Burma, Gaza, Haiti, Iran, Russia, Rwanda, Venezuela, West Africa, and more. But we have much more work to do. Too many Americans remain illegally and wrongfully detained, fearing for their lives and not knowing what tomorrow will bring. Too many families remain ripped apart, living in agony and uncertainty every day their loved one remains wrongfully held abroad. No family—and no American—should have to endure this suffering and separation.
That is why my Administration has taken unprecedented action to secure the release of all Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. In 2022, I signed an Executive Order to strengthen our efforts to address the scourge of hostage-taking and wrongful detention, including issuing more severe consequences for actors that illegally detain American citizens and attempt to use human beings as bargaining chips. Last year, we issued the first-ever sanctions against actors—including in Russia and Iran—for engaging in this abhorrent practice. My Administration has also focused on preventing these cases from occurring in the first place. We have joined 74 nations around the world and the European Union in endorsing the Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention. Finally, we have focused on providing families with loved ones held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad with the resources and support services they deserve.
Here at home, the Department of State launched a risk indictor that warns travelers if there is a high threat of wrongful detention at their destination. For more information on travel advisories, go to travel.state.gov.
As President, I have no higher duty than ensuring the safety and security of my fellow Americans—including all those who remain held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. I will continue to work to bring them home. I will continue to leverage every resource to punish and deter actors who engage in this despicable and unacceptable practice. I will not stop these efforts until every American is accounted for and safely back home. Today—and every day—that is my pledge.
The Congress, by Public Law 118-31 approved December 22, 2023, has designated March 9 of each year as ""U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day.""
Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 9, 2024, as U.S. Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day. On this day, as we fly the Hostage and Wrongful Detainee flag at the White House, I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with relevant programs, ceremonies, and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR."""

And, Desera, thank you for your introduction. And when you're President and I say—they say, ""Joe Biden is out in the waiting room,"" don't say ""Joe who?"" Okay? [Laughter]
Mayor Andre Dickenson—Dickens—I just add another syllable to your name. [Laughter] Thank you for the passport into the city, Mr. Mayor.
And Reverend Senator Warnock, thank you for your leadership. And thank you for the honor—giving me the honor to speak at your congregation at Ebenezer Baptist Church.
Look, Senator Ossoff—you're the best, Jon. You're doing a hell of a job. And he's always, always there, and he votes his conscience, and he's not afraid to stand up for what he believes.
To the many Members of the House of Representatives here and all other elected officials, thank you for your service.
And to former Atlanta mayor and former member of my team in the White House, Keisha Lance Bottoms, thank you. Keisha—I said to her a moment ago—I said, ""We miss you."" And her husband said: ""So did I. I got her."" [Laughter]
And, Governor Wes Moore, thank you for coming down from Maryland, man. He's the best, man. He can play. [Laughter]
And all of you here today, you know, you're the reason why we're going to win. By the way, that's not hyperbole. You're the reason we're going to win.
Donald Trump has a different constituency. Here's a guy who's kicking off his general election campaign on the road up with Marjorie Taylor Greene.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. It can tell you a lot about a person who he keeps company with. [Laughter] And yesterday he was hosting at his club Viktor Orban——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. ——who says he doesn't think democracy works. Called him a ""fantastic leader."" Seriously. [Laughter] He's been sucking up to win him—[laughter]—anyway—[inaudible]—dictators and authoritarian thugs all around the world.
He said the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un wrote him a—quote, ""wrote him a beautiful letter."" [Laughter] He bragged about calling Xi Jinping a ""king."" He called Putin, and he said, ""Do whatever the hell you want to our allies.""
Audience members. Boo!
The President. I'm not making these—I'm not making these quotes up. When he says he wants to be a dictator, I believe him.
But I don't want to get carried away here. [Laughter] Before I begin, I want to say thank you——
Audience member. What are you going to do, Genocide Joe? Tens of thousands of Palestinians—[inaudible].
The President. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Wait, wait, wait.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Look, thank you. Look, I don't resent—I don't resent—I don't resent his passion. There's a lot of Palestinians who are being unfairly victimized.
But, folks, look——
Audience member. Free, free Palestine! Free, free Palestine!
The President. ——before I begin, I want to say thank you to all those outstanding Black, Latinos, AAPI organizations supporting Kamala and me.
In 2020 and 2022, especially here in Georgia, but all across the country, you called your neighbors, you texted your friends, you knocked on doors, and you never stop. And you're with us all the way. And we're here to say a simple thank you, thank you, thank you.
And you're here tonight because you really want to do it again, because you are going to win this primary for us on Tuesday. And because we're going to win in November. So I mean this: Thank you, thank you, thank you. I really mean it.
Three years ago, you helped the Democratic ticket and won Georgia a Presidential election for the first time in 30 years. On Thursday, when I gave my State of the Union Address, I talked about how far we've come since the 2020 election. I also talked about how much is at stake.
Folks, it's not hyperbole to suggest our freedoms are literally on the ballot this November. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are trying to take our freedoms away.
And by the way, not all Republicans. This ain't your father's Republican Party. These guys are different. But guess what? We're not going to let them take them away.
Thursday night marked 59 years since hundreds of foot soldiers for justice in Selma, Alabama, marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge named after the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan to claim their fundamental right to vote. They were beaten, they are bloodied, they were left for dead, but they were unbowed.
Our late friend, son of Georgia, John Lewis, was there. And what happened? Five months later, we passed—the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. But nearly six decades after that, the same forces are back—led by Donald Trump—taking us back in time, suppressing the vote, subverting elections.
That's why we have to stand up again. We know what to do. And my message to Georgia voters and to voters all across this country is: Send me a Congress that will pass the Freedom To Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.
The same forces that want to deny the right to vote try to deny other core values of American diversity as well: banning books, erasing history. Instead of celebrating the contribution of immigrants to our country, to our economy, and our communities, Donald Trump calls them ""vermin,"" ""poison"" in the blooding of—poisoning the blood of America.
No one should ever doubt where my heart is. Unlike Donald Trump, on my first day in office as President, I introduced a comprehensive plan to fix our immigration system, secure our border, provide a pathway for citizenship for ""Dreamers"" and their families, farmworkers, essential workers who helped us through the pandemic and are part of the fabric of our community.
Because unlike Donald Trump, I know who we are as Americans. It's why I promised to have an administration that looks like America. The most diverse Cabinet and administration in American history led by a [historic; White House correction] Vice President.
A court that represents all the people. Sixty-five percent of the judges I've appointed are women. Sixty-five percent are people of color. I've appointed more Black women to the circuit courts than every other President in American history combined and the first African American woman to the Supreme Court.
Look, in my State of the Union Address, I talked about the social worker in Alabama. She scheduled an IVF treatment for a second child. But the Supreme Court of Alabama shut down IVF treatments across the State, unleashed by the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. What her family has gone through should never have happened. And, folks—folks, you know why this happened. Well, I tell you why: Donald Trump. He came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. In fact, he brags about it.
Well, he got his wish. And States are passing bans that criminalize doctors, forcing rape and incest victims to leave their States to get help. And now MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump want to pass a national ban on the right to choose.
Well, hear me loud and clear: not on my watch. In its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote, and I quote, ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" As I said in the State of the Union, ""They ain't seen nothing yet.""
But they're about to see—they're about to see it, just like we saw it on the ballot in 2022 and 2023. And they'll find out again in 2024.
I'm deadly earnest about this. Look, I want to thank Vice President Harris for leading the way on this issue and so many others.
And, Georgia, I have a message for you: Send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, and I promise you I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again.
Folks, I inherited an economy that was on the brink. But since I took office, we've created 15 million new jobs in just 3 years. That's a record in American history. Eight hundred new manufacturing jobs. I said, ""Where's it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world?""
Unemployment hit a 50-year low—so far. And under Donald Trump, Black and Latino unemployment skyrocketed. Under my administration, we have record low Black and Latino unemployment. Donald Trump, Asian American unemployment nearly doubled. Now—now—the employment rate of Asian Americans is the highest it's been since 2008.
Look, we've cut Black child poverty in half, cut Latino poverty by a record as well. We're seeing the fastest rate of new Latino businesses all over this decade. And the next 30 years, it's going to even be bigger.
Look, folks, more people have health insurance than ever before. The racial wealth gap is a smallest it's been in 20 years. Wages are back up; inflation is coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 to 3 percent.
And we've already accomplished a lot. So now let's talk about the future we can build together. It's about the future.
For example, Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere else in the world. It's wrong. But I'm ending it. With the law I proposed that we signed, no—not one Republican voted for it, I might add—we finally beat Big Pharma. For example, instead of paying $400 a month for insulin that saves seniors lives, they now only pay $35. Do you know how much it costs to make it? It costs $10. It costs $10 to make it.
But I didn't stop there. We capped insulin at 35 bucks a month, and I want to do it for every single American.
I finally beat Big Pharma and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for all prescription drugs and—like the VA does. But guess what? It just doesn't save seniors money, it's saving the taxpayers $160 billion, that one thing. Seriously.
Cutting the Federal deficit—these guys talk about the debt—I don't want to get into that. I'll get carried—[laughter].
Now it's time to go further and negotiate lower drug prices for every drug. Look, that will save taxpayers, if we do that, another $200 billion because Medicare doesn't have to pay the bill.
Beginning in January of next year, it's already the law we passed. We capped prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at total $2,000 a year, no matter how much they cost. Because you—as some of you know, unfortunately, you've experienced it. These cancer drugs can cost $10-, $12-, $15,000 a year. Now let's cap prescription drug costs to $2,000 a year for every American—all Americans.
And, folks, the Affordable Care Act is still a very big deal. It used to be called ""Obamacare."" Over 100 Americans—100 million Americans can no longer be denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition because of that law. And not only that, we've lowered the cost of insurance by $800 a year for so many families—and on top of it.
Donald Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. That would mean ripping health insurance away from 3 million Black Americans, 4 million Latinos, and a million Asian Americans. I've got news for Donald Trump: not on my watch. [Laughter] And if Trump and the Republicans try to cut Social Security again, I will stop them.
Look, I'm also working to bring down the cost of housing. That's why I want to provide—I want to provide an annual tax credit for the next 2 years of $400 a month, over the next 2 years, as rates come down, to put toward mortgages. If they're—buying your first home or you need to trade up a little for more space. That's what's going to happen. And the interest rates will be down.
We're cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price fixing and driving up rents. Now Congress needs to pass my plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable houses and apartments and bring those rents down.
Look, we're also removing all poisonous lead pipes in the—millions of them in America so every child can turn on a water fountain at school or at home without risking getting brain damage, because that's what's happening.
Look, and I'm making college more affordable. It was hard for me and my brothers and sisters to get through college because it was tough. And the tuitions weren't even anywhere near what they are today.
By fixing the student loan program, like the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, I've reduced the burden of student debt for nearly 4 million Americans, including teachers, nurses, firefighters, and other public servants.
Donald Trump swears that if he gets elected, he's going to stop it. Well, let me tell you something: He won't stop me.
So let's continue to increase Pell grants for working class and middle class families, increase our record investment in HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions.
We already contributed over $7 billion to HBCUs. And you know why? Because they're just as bright, just as capable as—though they don't have the endowments. And so they can't—they can't—they don't have the laboratories to train for the new high-tech jobs. But now they will. And now they do.
Look, we're building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Donald Trump did just the opposite. He enacted a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the top one-half of 1 percent and the biggest corporations and exploded the Federal deficit. He added more to the national debt in the 4 years he was there than any Presidential term in history——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. ——so—by the way. Give me a break about reducing the debt. Come on.
Folks, how many of you think the Tax Code is fair? Raise your hand.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Well, I sure don't. And I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in Federal tax. Nobody. Not one penny. But big corporations and the very wealthy will finally begin to pay their fair share.
In 2020, the 55 largest corporation—of the five—Fortune 500, 55 of those companies made $40 billion in profits, and they didn't pay a single penny in tax. Zero.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Not anymore. Thanks to the law I wrote and signed, big companies have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. But 15 percent is still less than working people pay in Federal taxes. It's time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every billion-dollar corporation begins to finally begin to pay their fair share.
Look, folks, there are 1,000 billionaires in America—1,000. Look, I'm a—I'm a capitalist. If you make a billion dollars, fine, if you do it fairly. But guess what? Pay your fair share of Federal taxes. Do you know how much they pay? You know what the rate is they pay in Federal taxes? Eight-point-two percent.
Raise your hand if you'd trade for that? You'd all take 8.2 percent, wouldn't you? It's far less than the vast majority of Americans pay. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse.
That's why I proposed a minimum tax of 25 percent for billionaires—25—just 25 percent. You know how much money that would raise? Five hundred billion dollars over the next 10 years. Imagine what that could do for America and our—for our future—from lowering the deficit to childcare, home care, paid leave so many other countries have—and still lower the deficit.
Look, folks, let me close with this. You're all standing. I'm keeping you too long. I know——
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. I know the American story. It's a—thank you.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Thank you. Folks, look, I know the American story. It's a contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of this Nation, between those who want to pull America backwards and those who want to move America into the future.
My lifetime has taught me to embrace the future of freedom and democracy. And Trump and I have a very different value set, if it isn't obvious already. Mine is based on core values that have defined America. And the rest of the world looks at us that way: decency, honesty, fairness, equality.
But we all know Donald Trump sees a different America, an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution. That's not me. That's not you.
We see a future where we define democracy and defend it, not diminish it. We see a future where we defend the basic freedoms, not take them away. We see a future—we see a future where we reward work, not just wealth, where the wealthy pay their fair share. And we see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.
And, folks, I mean this. As I've traveled the world—I've been in most countries around the world. I know the vast majority of the world leaders because I've been around a day or two. [Laughter] I know I don't look it. [Laughter]
But we see a future—I see a future—that must remain the beacon of the world. Above all, we see a country for all Americans, a future for all Americans, a Presidency for all Americans. So join me. Get out the vote.
Vote! Vote! Vote!
Audience members. Vote! Vote! Vote!
The President. Vote!
Folks, from the bottom of my heart, I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. We just have to remember who we are, for God's sake. We are the United States of America. There is simply nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together. So let's do that. Get out to vote.
And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

"Mar 10, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-observance-ramadan-12,Statement on the Observance of Ramadan,"""Tonight—as the new crescent Moon marks the beginning of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan—Jill and I extend our best wishes and prayers to Muslims across our country and around the world.

The sacred month is a time for reflection and renewal. This year, it comes at a moment of immense pain. The war in Gaza has inflicted terrible suffering on the Palestinian people. More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of them civilians, including thousands of children. Some are family members of American Muslims, who are deeply grieving their lost loved ones today. Nearly 2 million Palestinians have been displaced by the war; many are in urgent need of food, water, medicine, and shelter. As Muslims gather around the world over the coming days and weeks to break their fast, the suffering of the Palestinian people will be front of mind for many. It is front of mind for me.

The United States will continue to lead international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance into Gaza by land, air, and sea. Earlier this week, I directed our military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments of aid. We are carrying out airdrops of aid, in coordination with our international partners, including Jordan. And we'll continue to work with Israel to expand deliveries by land, insisting that it facilitate more routes and open more crossings to get more aid to more people.

While we get more lifesaving aid to Gaza, the United States will continue working nonstop to establish an immediate and sustained cease-fire for at least 6 weeks as part of a deal that releases hostages. And we will continue building toward a long-term future of stability, security, and peace. That includes a two-state solution to ensure Palestinians and Israelis share equal measures of freedom, dignity, security, and prosperity. That is the only path toward an enduring peace.

Here at home, we have seen an appalling resurgence of hate and violence toward Muslim Americans. Islamophobia has absolutely no place in the United States, a country founded on freedom of worship and built on the contributions of immigrants, including Muslim immigrants. My administration is developing the first-ever National Strategy To Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination, to take on hate against Muslim, Sikh, South Asian, and Arab American communities, wherever it occurs. No one should ever fear being targeted at school, at work, on the street, or in their community because of their background or beliefs.

To Muslims across our country, please know that you are deeply valued members of our American family. To those who are grieving during this time of war, I hear you, I see you, and I pray you find solace in your faith, family, and community. And to all who are marking the beginning of Ramadan tonight, I wish you a safe, healthy, and blessed month. Ramadan kareem."""

"Mar 11, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-budget-message-the-president-22,The Budget Message of the President,"""To the Congress of the United States:
When I was elected President, a pandemic was raging and our economy was reeling. We were in the midst of the most devastating downturn in nearly a century. I came into office determined to fundamentally change things, by rebuilding our economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down—because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do well. We all do. We can give everyone a fair shot and leave no one behind.
Our work started with the American Rescue Plan, which vaccinated the Nation, delivered immediate economic relief to people who badly needed it, and sent funding to States and cities to keep key services going. It continued with the biggest investment in our Nation's infrastructure since the 1950s. More than 46,000 new projects have been announced to date, rebuilding our roads, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, public transit, water systems, high-speed internet, and more. At the same time, we are making the most significant investment in fighting climate change in the history of the world. I have seen Americans' courage and resilience in the wake of devastating natural disasters, and I will always have their backs as we rebuild and boost resilience to extreme weather. We are building a cleaner, more resilient and sustainable power grid, and making America's biggest investment in rural electricity since the New Deal. We are revitalizing fence-line communities that have shouldered the burden of harmful pollution for generations. We are lowering energy costs for hardworking families and strengthening our energy security with clean energy breakthroughs. Across the board, we are supporting advanced manufacturing, ensuring the industries of the future are made in America by American workers.
Our plan is working. Already, my Investing in America agenda has attracted $650 billion in private investment from companies that are building factories and moving production back to America. We are making things here in America again, with American union workers. We have ignited a manufacturing boom, a semiconductor boom, an electric-vehicle boom, and more. My agenda is creating hundreds of thousands of union jobs, so folks never have to leave their hometowns to find good-paying work they can raise a family on. Today, America once again has the strongest economy in the world. We have created a record 15 million jobs, with unemployment under four percent for the longest stretch in over 50 years. Growth is strong. Wages are rising and inflation is down by two-thirds, with costs having fallen for key household items from a gallon of gas to a gallon of milk. We have more to do, but folks are starting to feel the benefits. Consumer sentiment has surged more in recent months than any time in 30 years. Americans have filed a record 16 million new business applications since I took office; each one of them is an act of hope.
Importantly, we made these historic investments in a fiscally responsible way, while making our tax system fairer. In 2022, I signed a law that imposed a new minimum tax of 15 percent on the Nation's largest corporations, saved $160 billion by giving Medicare the authority to negotiate prescription drug prices and limit price increases, and boosted funding to the Internal Revenue Service to crack down on wealthy and corporate tax cheats. This is just the beginning. My Budget would do more to close loopholes. It would save another $200 billion by enabling Medicare to negotiate prices on even more drugs and by limiting other drug price increases. It would cut wasteful subsidies to Big Oil and other special interests; and it would introduce a minimum tax on billionaires, which alone would raise $500 billion for the American people.
So far, we have already cut the deficit by $1 trillion since I took office, one of the biggest reductions in history, and I have signed legislation to cut it by $1 trillion more. My Budget would reduce it by another $3 trillion over the next 10 years as well, while continuing to pay for our investments in America.
And we are just getting started.
My Administration will keep fighting to lower costs for working families, on everything from housing to childcare to student loans. After decades of talk in Washington, we beat Big Pharma and capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month, down from as much as $400. Starting next year, no senior on Medicare will pay more than $2,000 a year in total out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, even for expensive cancer medications that now cost many times more. We are cracking down on price gouging by requiring drugmakers that raise prices of certain drugs faster than inflation to pay a rebate back to Medicare. At the same time, we have protected and expanded the Affordable Care Act, with a record 21 million Americans enrolled in marketplace plans this past year, while saving millions of Americans $800 per year on their premiums. Today, more Americans have health insurance than ever before. My Budget builds on those gains.
I also know that for too many hardworking families, it costs too much to find a good home, so we are working to lower costs and boost supply of housing nationwide. My Budget will make monthly mortgage payments more affordable for middle-class first-time homebuyers by providing a $5,000 annual mortgage relief credit for two years. My Budget will expand rental assistance to hundreds of thousands of additional families, continuing the largest expansion in 20 years. It will also help to ease America's longstanding shortage of affordable housing, including by cutting red tape, so that more builders can get Federal financing to build more affordable housing. Important progress is underway: more families own homes today than before the pandemic; rents are easing; and a record 1.7 million housing units are under construction nationwide.
My Budget also makes key investments in childcare and education, so every child in America can have the strong start they need to thrive. It restores the Child Tax Credit expansion I signed into law, which cut child poverty nearly in half in 2021; and it guarantees the vast majority of families high-quality childcare for no more than $10 a day, while boosting pay for childcare workers. It offers universal free preschool for all four million of America's four-year-olds. Building on the American Rescue Plan's investment in public education, the biggest in history, it also helps States expand tutoring, afterschool, and summer programs; and boosts recruiting to ease teacher shortages.
At the same time, I am keeping my promise to ease the crushing burden of student debt. Despite legal challenges, we have canceled some $138 billion in student debt for nearly four million Americans, including more than 750,000 teachers, nurses, firefighters, social workers, and other public servants. That is freeing people to finally consider buying a home, having a child, or starting that small business they always dreamed of.
We are also working to secure our border. In October, I sent an emergency request for more funding; my Budget renews that request for additional resources, including for 1,300 more Border Patrol agents, 375 immigration judges, and 1,600 asylum officers, and for cutting-edge technology to help detect fentanyl. We need to pass the Senate's bipartisan border deal as well, which would make urgent additional investments to secure the border and help to fix our broken immigration system.
Today, the world is facing an inflection point in history, at home and abroad. My Administration has restored America's leadership on the world stage, rallying more than 50 nations to support Ukraine in the face of brutal Russian aggression, strengthening and expanding NATO, revitalizing our alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific—including with Japan, South Korea, and Australia—and strengthening democracy across the globe. But we need to do more to prove that America can once again be relied on to stand up for freedom. In October, I submitted a national security supplemental request to cover urgent needs, including support for Ukraine and Israel, and humanitarian aid and relief for Palestinians. My Budget reiterates that request and continues other critical support for NATO allies and partners around the world. It strengthens our deterrence capacity in the Indo-Pacific, expanding our capabilities in the region. It also works to keep our military the best-trained, best-equipped fighting force in the world, integrating advanced innovation technologies, and improving overall readiness. My Budget also takes important steps to honor our Nation's most sacred obligation—to protect and equip our troops when they are in harm's way, and to care for them and their families throughout and after their service. Since I took office, I have signed over 30 significant bipartisan bills to support veterans, including the PACT Act, the biggest-ever expansion of benefits for servicemembers exposed to toxic burn pits during their service; and I have issued the most comprehensive executive actions to date to boost economic security for military families. My Budget builds on that work.
The story of America is one of progress and resilience, of always moving forward and never giving up. It is a story unique among nations. We are the only nation that has emerged from every crisis we have entered stronger than we went in. While my Administration has seen great progress since day one, there is still work to do. My Budget will help make that promise real.

Jill and I are devastated to learn that American Itay Chen was killed by Hamas during its brutal terrorist assault on October 7.
In December, Itay's father and brother joined me at the White House, to share the agony and uncertainty they've faced as they prayed for the safe return of their loved one. No one should have to endure even one day of what they have gone through. At the end of our meeting, they gave me a menorah, a solemn reminder that light will always dispel the darkness and evil will not win.
Today, as we join Itay's parents, brothers, and family in grieving this tragic loss, we keep this reminder close to our hearts. And I reaffirm my pledge to all the families of those still held hostage: We are with you. We will never stop working to bring your loved ones home.""

"Mar 15, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-international-day-combat-islamophobia,Statement on the International Day To Combat Islamophobia,"""Five years ago today, a gunman fired upon worshippers at the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Center in Christchurch, New Zealand, murdering 51 people, wounding 40 others, and forever shattering families in one of the deadliest mass shootings in history. Today, on the International Day to Combat Islamophobia, we remember these innocent souls who were stolen from us while peacefully praying.
We recognize the violence and hate that Muslims worldwide too often face because of their religious beliefs—and the ugly resurgence of Islamophobia in the wake of the devastating war in Gaza. And we rededicate ourselves to building a world where people of all faiths and all backgrounds are free to live without fear of persecution.
That includes right here at home. I've said it many times: Islamophobia has no place in our Nation. Yet Muslims in the United States frequently endure baseless fearmongering, blatant discrimination, harassment, and violence in the course of their everyday lives. Today Jill and I remember Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian American boy brutally killed in his own home last fall, a crushing loss for his family and community and a devastating reminder of how all Americans must unequivocally stand up against hate.
That's why, in 2022, my administration established an interagency policy committee to counter anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and discrimination. We are also currently drafting the first-ever National Strategy To Combat Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination. The goal of this strategy is to mobilize a whole-of-society effort to counter all forms of hate, discrimination, and bias against Muslim, Sikh, South Asian, and Arab American communities and to raise awareness about their heritage and invaluable contributions to our country. We are also strengthening the security of mosques and other places of worship and working to prevent and prosecute hate crimes against vulnerable communities. And my administration continues to implement the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism amidst the serious increase in anti-Semitism and to advance the White House Initiative on Hate-Motivated Violence. Put simply, we are taking concrete steps to make real for all Americans the promise of America: that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We have never fully lived up to that promise, but we have never walked away from it either, and for as long as I'm President, we never will.
Today, as millions continue to observe the holy month of Ramadan, Jill and I extend our best wishes to Muslims everywhere and continue to keep them in our prayers. And we reaffirm our commitment to do all we can to put an end to the vicious hate of Islamophobia, here at home and around the world."""

Well, Taoiseach, welcome back to the Oval Office. It's good to have you back. And I want to thank you again for the reception I had last—when I was last in Ireland. As a matter of fact, my family wasn't sure we wanted to come home. It was so nice.
Look, it's great to see you again, a great chance to return some of the hospitality that you provided me when I was in Ireland last. And I know there are all kinds of Irish—old Irish sayings, but my Grandfather Finnegan used to say, ""May the hinge of our friendship never go rusty."" He had all these sayings, you know. The Irish in America sometimes think they're more Irish than the Irish.
But—and I don't think we're going to let it go rusty. We're vital to each other's economies. We're good friends. And we're—and today celebrates 100 years——
Prime Minister Varadkar. That's right.
President Biden. ——100 years of diplomatic relations between Ireland and America. And as far as that friendship goes, it keeps increasing and not diminishing, and I would argue it's stronger than ever.
Together, we're deepening our economic partnership. There are 300,000—helped create 300,000 jobs across both our nations.
And we're working together to increase humanitarian assistance in Gaza. And we both know that a whole lot more has to be done.
And we're standing together to support Ukraine in the face of Putin's onslaught, the savagery with which he's attacking Ukrainians. And I want to thank you, Leo, for Ireland's unwavering assistance to Ukraine, including millions of vital humanitarian aid that you provide—millions of dollars.
And I'm urging our Congress to do its part to get back in the game of—we were able to find another $300 million, but we have a $6 billion package—a $60 billion package. And we're really working—so, when we're up in the Hill, I'd ask you to lobby them for me.
Prime Minister Varadkar. I will.
President Biden. That was a joke, guys. [Laughter] That was a joke.
But I'm urging them to—Congress to pass the bipartisan legislation now that includes a significant amount of humanitarian aid, including to Ukraine and Gaza.
And as I said in Belfast last year, we remain committed to protecting the peace and progress in Northern Ireland since the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. And like you, I'm glad to see Northern Ireland's Executive and Assembly are up and running. And I think that's, from my perspective, a very positive step forward.
So, Leo, thank you, again, for being here. And as we begin the next century of our partnership and friendship, I've never been more optimistic because, you know, united by history, heritage, and hope, I think there's not a damn thing we can't do together. So, welcome.
Prime Minister Varadkar. Thank you. Thank you so much.
Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And thanks for giving us so much time over these next few days. And very keen to talk about four main things while we're together.
Since we last met, back in New York, briefly in September at the U.N., and since your visit to Ireland last year, it's really good to see the institutions in Northern Ireland up and running. It just makes such a difference to have the Good Friday Agreement properly functioning.
So, the—as you know, the Deputy First Minister and First Minister are here. The Executive and Assembly are operating. We'll have our North South Ministerial Council meeting next month and the British-Irish Council in June. So, really good to see the promise of that agreement—that Good Friday Agreement being fulfilled again, which is such a positive change since the last time we met.
As you mentioned, we've—celebrating a hundred years of diplomatic relations. The U.S is one of the first countries to recognize Irish independence. And it's become such a strong relationship since then.
I'm very keen to talk about that a bit more, and also the strength of our economic relationship now, which increasingly goes both ways. There's now 100,000 Americans working in firms that are Irish-owned here in the U.S., and we're one of the top 10 investors in the U.S. now. So, great to be able to repay some of that interest.
Obviously, keen to talk about the situation in Gaza as well. You know, my view that we need to have a cease-fire as soon as possible to get food and medicine in——
President Biden. And I agree.
Prime Minister Varadkar. ——to get the hostages out. And we need to talk about how we can make that happen and move towards a two-state solution, which I think is the only—the only way we'll have lasting peace and security.
President Biden. I agree.
Prime Minister Varadkar. And then, on Ukraine—just really want to thank you and America for your leadership on Ukraine. We're very worried about the situation there. And we don't think that if Putin is successful in Ukraine he'll stop there. And we really need your continued support and leadership on Ukraine and look forward to speaking to the congressional leaders about that as well later on.
And we'll have a European Council meeting next week of the—of the 27 EU Prime Ministers, so they're going to be very keen to know what—what I learned here in Washington.
And that's a—that's a fight we've got to win.
President Biden. Well, you can tell them that the President of the United States is strongly committed to making sure we provide that aid.
Well, thank you very much. We'll get a chance to bring in our delegations.
And thank you all for being here, folks.
Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer's Remarks on Israeli Military Operations in Gaza, Palestinian Territories 
Q. Do you have any comment, sir, on Senator Schumer's speech on Israel yesterday?
President Biden. Senator Schumer contacted my staff—my senior staff—he was going to make that speech. And he—I'm not going to elaborate on the speech. He made a good speech, and I think he expressed a serious concern shared not only by him, but by many Americans.
[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]
Q. Mr. President, can there be a cease-fire before the end of Ramadan? Mr. President, can there be a cease-fire before the end of Ramadan?
President Biden. [Inaudible]

The President's Travel Schedule 
Q. Will you go back to Ireland?
The President. I always want to—I always want to go back to Ireland."""
"Mar 15, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-with-prime-minister-leo-varadkar-ireland-the-congressional-friends-ireland-0,Remarks With Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland at the Congressional Friends of Ireland Luncheon,"""Speaker of the House of Representatives J. Michael Johnson. All right, let me—if I could have your attention. Steny. Well, thank you all. I know it's been a great time of fellowship and enjoyment. It's been very loud in here. That's a good sign. That's a good sign. Not great acoustics, but great fellowship.
This lunch is a special event, as we noted earlier, because it's a time when we come together here in Washington each year. And what's unique about it, what's important, I think, is that we look past our political differences for this moment in time and we remember the importance of peacemaking and we celebrate the important friendship between our two countries, the United States and Ireland.
And today we all welcome continued efforts to promote and preserve the Good Friday Agreement and promises of a bright future for all the friends of Ireland.
And certainly, at this time, in many ways, our hearts are heavy, in spite of the fun fellowship, because stability is being threatened in Europe and in the Middle East. And our allies and friends, such as Israel and Taiwan, continue to fight for their very right to exist.
And I know everyone is this room is committed to the same things. We know that we all must stand for national sovereignty and work for peace.
And this is an important time for all of us to encourage a productive dialogue and mutual respect. And even when we may disagree on matters of politics and policy, which is inevitable, we should all appreciate traditions like this, an occasion for thoughtful discourse where we can thoughtfully move beyond was Yeats called ""polite"" but ""meaningless words.""
When we do that, it restores trust among the people and it renews faith in our institutions. And I think all of us know that we need that desperately right now.
So today I'm happy that we're able to showcase the Irish spirit of charity and humor and friendship that flows through your children and through my children and all the children and all of the friends of Ireland.
So I have the distinct pleasure now of introducing our Commander in Chief and someone who is known everywhere as America's most famous Irishman, President Joe Biden.
President Biden. Well, thank you all very much. Thank you.
Well, Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. I was telling the Speaker at dinner when a good friend of mine and of many of you, a former Senator from Oregon, Senator Smith, came to me when I was Vice President and said: ""You know, I've checked it out. You're able to accept this gift."" I said, ""What's the gift?"" He said, ""Well, the single most significant compilation of historical records and family records are held by the Mormon church."" And he said: ""We want to do—we want to do a background for you. We want to check your genealogy for you.""
And they ended up showing up 5 months later with six volumes. And one of them pointed out that, on one side of the family, the ones that came from County Louth, they started off in New Orleans. And I've warned them. They could have stayed; I would have been a bit of trouble. [Laughter]
Folks, look, Mr. Speaker and—I want to—I want you to know that diplomat Shane Leslie once wrote, ""Every St. Patrick's Day—every St. Patrick's Day, every Irishman goes out to find another Irishman to make a speech to."" So—[laughter]—so thank you for allowing me to find you. Mom, it's okay. [Laughter]
Look, you know, I'm glad I found all of you, because no matter how much we debate, no matter how much we disagree, we always have been able to come together as friends of Ireland. And, you know, the friendship goes back centuries.
But today is an important period, an important milestone: nearly 100 years of diplomatic relations, Taoiseach, and—[inaudible]—100 years of Ireland and the United States.
So, Mr. Speaker, thank you for hosting us today. It's a tradition I've always enjoyed.
And, Taoiseach, thank you for joining us again.
And I'd also like to extend the 100,000 welcomes to all leaders who are involved in the Ireland and Northern Ireland agreements that they've now—put it together. And I think—I just wonder whether my mother would have ever thought that would happen. [Laughter] But it's happened, and it's great. You know, it's great to come together once again.
To all Irish Americans, Democrats and Republican Members here, I'm glad to be united on this issue. We begin the next century of a real partnership. And it has been partnership, but it's really increasing now.
And finally, to all that wish they were Irish, I'm glad you're here too. [Laughter] My grandfather used to say that being Irish is enough. [Laughter] At any rate, I won't go into that. [Laughter]
Well, I stand here as a proud descendant of the Finnegans and the Blewitts. The Finnegans from the County Mayo, which I just was there not long ago, and the Finnegans from County Louth. And this pride is part of my soul, as I'm sure that all of you who are Irish ancestry feel the same way.
In fact, as many of you know, when I served on Capitol Hill, my colleagues used to kid me because I always quoted Irish poets. They thought I quoted Irish poets, Rev, because I was Irish. I don't do it for that reason. Because they're the best poets in the world, that's why I quote them. [Laughter]
Steny, it's true. [Laughter]
And, you know, I really—today there's one poem in particular that comes to mind. It was written by my great-grandfather Edward Francis Blewitt, who was only the second Catholic elected to the State senate in the State of Pennsylvania, back in 1906. And he wrote a book of poems, a hundred poems, and—about his—he referred to it as his Ireland.
One, he called ""The Worker."" And here's what he said: ""No barrier is too thick or strong to stay the onward march each day. A goal they seek, a goal they find. Hardship for them is but real play.""
And I think, together, Ireland and America are always marching forward toward a better world, toward a better life, and one of greater liberty, greater dignity, and greater equity and outcomes of opportunity and possibilities for everybody—possibilities.
I was with Xi Jinping a couple of years ago on the Tibetan Plateau, and he asked me could I define America. And I said—this was recorded by him, as well. I said, ""Yes, in one word."" He said, ""What's that?"" I said, ""Possibilities.""
Think about it. What defines us as Americans? We think anything is possible. Anything is possible if we do it together.
Well, together, Ireland and America have always moved onward for a better future, one of greater liberty, greater dignity, greater equality, opportunity, and possibility. And even when those barriers seem so thick and so strong, even—even when we face sorrow, setbacks, and divisions and darkness, together, we've always persevered, Ireland and the United States. We've always held out hope in horizons that we've not yet seen.
You know, I often say that the Irish are the only people in the world who are nostalgic about tomorrow. [Laughter] Think about it. That's an original quote, unfortunately.
But they—that's—[inaudible]—seems who we are. And I often say that because wherever there is a yearning for freedom, wherever there is a call for progress, people around the world, they can always count on Ireland and the United States to be on their side, not just for hope, but to help, to help —them in their march forward. We see this in our support of Ukraine and the people in the face of Putin's vicious onslaught against Ukraine.
Taoiseach, we had a meeting earlier today. I told you that I'm deeply grateful for Ireland's unwavering humanitarian aid to the people of not only Ukraine, but also Gaza. I'm committed to continue to do our part. I'm confident the vast majority—and excuse me for saying this, but I think the vast majority of Members of Congress are willing to do their part and continue to urge every Member in this room to stand up to Vladimir Putin. He's a thug—a thug.
And I urge you to send me the national security bill now. The bill includes funding for Ukraine and Israel and, maybe equally important, humanitarian assistance to Gaza. They badly, badly need it. And it sends a clear message that America stands up for freedom and we bow down to no one—to no one—in the world.
You know, I said in Belfast last year, where we marked the 25th anniversary of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, I'm also committed to protecting peace and progress in Northern Ireland. We all know—we all know that we feel—I assume all of us feel the same way. That includes Northern Ireland's newest leaders, Minister O'Neill, and your Deputy First Minister—are you guys here? Stand up. [Applause] Thank you.
As a friend of mine from Claymont, Delaware, would say, ""Who woulda thunk it?"" [Laughter]
Thankfully, you're here.
And look, to both of you, for—thank you for reminding us what possibilities are as we work across the aisle and rise above longstanding disagreements.
Let me close with this. I think we stand at an inflection point not only in American history, but in world history where the decisions we make now are going to determine what the next three, four, five, six decades are going to look like. And I believe history is watching. I think history is watching.
Today let us resolve to march forward with each other and all those who—all those who seek a better future. Like our ancestors, remember no barrier is too thick or too strong for Ireland and the United States to get through. There's nothing—nothing—our nations can't do together when we work together. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I'm confident there's not a thing we can't do if we work together. And I say the same thing. Remember this is the United States of America. There is nothing—nothing, nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity when we work together.
So my prayer today is, we continue and we increase our working together. Thank you all for having me.
Speaker Johnson. Thank you for your remarks, Mr. President.
And our next guest, though he is now leading the country and I believe he is the youngest to ever hold his office, he started out—you may not know this—as an intern in these very halls more than two decades ago. And while this is my first time having the pleasure to meet him in person, he's no stranger to this lunch either. He's been in leadership for quite some time. And he's done a few of these.
Will you please join me in welcoming our guest of honor from the Republic of Ireland, the Taoiseach.
[At this point, Prime Minister Varadkar spoke briefly in Irish; no translation was provided. He then continued in English as follows.]
Prime Minister Varadkar. Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of Congress, First Minister, Deputy First Minister, esteemed friends and colleagues, it is a honor and a privilege to be back among friends here in Washington, DC, today. And thank you, Mr. Speaker, for continuing the tradition of hosting this lunch today. We are very appreciative.
I believe that Ireland is perhaps the only country in the world that can get away with turning our national holiday into an international week of events or, in some places, a whole month. [Laughter]
We're also unique in having a national holiday where the head of government and all the senior Ministers leave the country to celebrate it around the world—[laughter]—with our diaspora and our friends and our allies.
St. Patrick's Day is more than our national holiday. It is an international moment. It's when we get to share our story with the world: a story of faith in the future, no matter what the obstacles; hope in our ability to work together for the greater good; and of charity towards those who are experiencing suffering.
As the President acknowledged, since we last gathered here last year, the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement have returned. And it's hugely significant that we're joined here today by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly, two women from different political traditions who are showing what can be achieved working together, holding jointly a coequal office as heads of government of Northern Ireland. It is so good to have both of you here today.
And it's really good to see colleagues here as well, Ministers and Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, including the Speaker of the Assembly, Mr. Poots. Also, to see Members of the House of Commons here too and Members of Dáil Éireann and Oireachtas here, too, as well. So very much seeing all three strands of the Good Friday Agreement, the totality of relationships—Northern Ireland, North-South, and East-West—all represented here today, which makes this a very special moment.
And I want, on behalf of all of us, to thank the United States and Members from both sides of the aisle and, indeed, beyond politics for what you've done to help make Ireland and Northern Ireland a place where young people can dream of coming times brighter than their grandparents could ever have dared imagine.
So thank you for your role in giving us back our future. We'll forever remember the steadfast work of so many Members of Congress—Democrat and Republican—as well as successive administrations over the years who have made this possible.
Throughout the entirety of the peace process, the Friends of Ireland Caucus have been our resolute friends. And on behalf of the Irish people, thank you for your commitment to Ireland. Our country is so grateful for your friendship, for your leadership, and for your enduring support. So, thank you so much.
Mr. Speaker, someday soon, we would really like to welcome you to Ireland. So consider this the official invitation. We'd love to show you around.
And, of course, last year, we had the pleasure of showing President Biden around the country. Although he knows it so well, I don't think he needed a tour guide. But it was a wonderful opportunity for him to reconnect with relatives and friends and also to make new ones.
Mr. Speaker, today, as we run into St. Patrick's Day, I'm thinking very much of the prayer of St. Patrick, which was alluded to earlier. As we face the most complicated and difficult circumstances in the world, problems that have no easy answers, which demand that we do our best to repel the forces of darkness, to defend our values, and to shield the innocent—I'm thinking of St. Patrick's prayer today for strength and protection against every cruel and merciless power.
When I reflect on the war being waged by Russia against Ukraine, the light of democracy, the rule of international law, and liberty itself are under attack from a relentless adversary who would extinguish them. Ukraine must not fall. And together, we need to stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.
I'm also thinking of St. Patrick's prayer today when he prayed for the wisdom to guide us, when I reflect on the catastrophe that's unfolding in the Middle East: the savage attacks of October 7 on Israel and the terrible violence and loss of human life in Gaza which has followed and continues. And we very much want that to end.
These are global challenges that demand our courage, our empathy, and our action. And we pray for the wisdom of St. Patrick in facing them.
Mr. Speaker, over a hundred years ago, Ireland and the U.S. established diplomatic relations, the oldest republic welcoming the newest member of the international community. And since then, it's a relationship that has grown on respect, friendship, and shared kinship.
So, thank you so much for helping us in those hundred years to take our place among the nations of the world. We look forward to working with America for the next hundred years, a second century of friendship and alliance.
[Prime Minister Varadkar spoke briefly in Irish; no translation was provided. He then concluded in English as follows.]

Audience members. Hello!
The President. We've got a great guest with us today. We ought to change the rules in the United States: When St. Patrick's Day falls on a Sunday, the next day is a holiday. [Laughter]
On behalf of the Finnegans of County Louth and the Blewitts of County Mayo—[applause]—my mother Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden of Scranton, Pennsylvania—welcome—welcome to St. Patrick's Day at the White House.
The Taoiseach and I extend a hundred thousand welcomes to you, all of you—every one of you—whether you're Irish or whether you wish you were Irish. [Laughter] We're very glad you're all here.
Look, St. Patrick's Day is about friendship. And we have many friends here today, because St. Patrick is a moment that—great unity in Washington. Whether you're from the red State or a blue State, on this day, you're Irish green. [Laughter] And so—[applause].
We're joined by Members of Congress, as well as members of my Cabinet. Claire Cronin is here, our Ambassador, who's doing—[applause]—Claire, you're doing great work.
And of course, our guest of honor, the Taoiseach. It's wonderful to welcome you and Matthew back to the White House. We've spent a lot of—quite a lot of time together on this visit, visiting Capitol Hill, sharing laughs at the Gridiron Dinner. Kamala had you over for breakfast as well. And on top of all that, yesterday Ireland won the Six Nations Rugby—[inaudible]. [Applause]
My whole family is so excited because two of my cousins who no longer play for the team—they were great stars—you won anyway. [Laughter]
It's been a great visit that captures how strong the friendship is between our countries.
Look, we also have friends here today from Northern Ireland: the First Minister and Deputy First Minister—Michelle, Emma. Where were you, Michelle? It's great to have you here.
And I was very happy to see Northern Ireland's Executive Assembly reinstated last month. Now, Northern Ireland has a fully functioning government again. And I didn't—[inaudible]—mention your colleague.
Young people of Northern Ireland represent the great peace dividend of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement—the entire generation whose hearts have been shaped not by grievances of the past, but by confidence in a better future that we're writing together.
The United States believes—believes—in that future. Joe Kennedy is here tonight, along with—[applause]—that's okay, Joe Joe; you only have 57 here—[laughter]—along with dozens of family members—I've got to tell you something. He's leading the charge to ramp up investments in Northern Ireland, because economic opportunity is going to help make the benefits of peace real and lasting. And from one big Irish Catholic family to another, it's great to have the Kennedys here—[inaudible]. [Applause]
Folks, St. Patrick's Day is a joyful occasion. It's a time to remember with pride our ties to the Emerald Isle, the land of poets and dreamers, fierce fighters, hard workers who endured decades of poverty and subjugation and persevered through it all, because the Irish spirit can never—can never—can never be overcome.
Folks, we remember with awe the waves of Irish immigrants who had the courage to travel across the sea, because they believed, as the poet Seamus Heaney once wrote, ""a further shore is reachable from here""—that's what he wrote about—""a further shore is reachable from here."" They arrived in America with little more than hope in their hearts and the strength of their dreams. Their sweat is soaked into the foundations of this country.
As I said at the State of the Union, America has a heart and soul that draws in the old and the new, home to people of every place on Earth—from every place on Earth. We all come from somewhere, but we're all Americans. We can never forget that. That's the critical element that binds us together.
And this year, Ireland and the United States mark a milestone: 100 years of diplomatic relations between our countries. One hundred years. I was not—[applause]—I want to make clear: I wasn't there at the hundredth. [Laughter]
In that time, the ties between us have deepened and multiplied. Our economic partnership has grown tremendously, in both directions, I might add. Ireland now is one of the top 10 investors in the United States economy.
And our countries stand proudly for liberty and against tyranny. We stand together and oppose Russia's brutal war of aggression in Ukraine. You can clap for that, please. [Applause] We've got to get this done.
And the Taoiseach and I agree about the urgent need to increase humanitarian aid in Gaza and get the cease-fire deal—[applause]—and get a cease-fire deal that brings our—brings the hostages home and move toward a two-state solution, which is the only path—the only path—for a lasting peace and security.
Folks, my friends, since the last time we celebrated St. Patrick's Day together, I made a trip of a lifetime back home to Belfast in 20—20—the 25th anniversary of the peace accords; then to County Louth, where I visited the church where my ancestors were baptized; then to Dublin for a speech at the Irish Parliament; and finally, to County Mayo, to the town called Ballina.
There, a huge cathedral—St. Murdoch's—right on the banks of the River Moy. One of the men who helped build that was Edward Blewitt, my great-great-great-grandfather. He worked in the town brickyard.
In 1828, he was paid—and they gave me a receipt—21 pounds and 12 shillings to help supply the bricks for that cathedral. It was made able to touch—I was—it was made, and I was able to touch some of it with my own hands, the very bricks he made.
And all I could think was this: I'm sure [as; White House correction] Edward labored, he imagined that one day his family would worship at that cathedral, that his children would be baptized there, that future generations of his family would make milestone—mark milestones there. But I doubt he imagined, nearly 200 years later, his great-great-great-grandson would return to the cathedral as President of the United States of America.
On that trip, before I got there, I toured Carlingford Castle, as you remember—in County Louth—Taoiseach. It was likely one of the last glimpses of Ireland that my Finnegan ancestors saw when they sailed away to new lives—for new lives in America. They left in the port of Newry in the year 1850.
And here's an amazing fact. It turns out that [is; White House correction] the exact same port Barack Obama's ancestors sailed from. They left 5 weeks earlier, his ancestors. They were nearly on the same ship. Both of our great-great-great-great-grandchildren—both of their great-great-grandchildren [great-great-great-grandchildren; White House correction] ended up President of the United States of America. It's remarkable.
Stories like these are why I often say the Irish are the only people who are nostalgic about the future. [Laughter] We believe in better tomorrows, and we've always—looking for the next horizon. That's a very American trait as well.
Just more proof that the bonds between Ireland and the United States run deep: our joys, our sorrows, our passions, our dreams, our optimism. Even the most—in the most difficult moments, we hold onto hope. That's what we do. We see the world of unlimited possibilities, a future that knows no bounds. And we're writing that future now, and we're doing it together, Ireland and America, just as we have for generations.
Let me end with this. As I said on St. Patrick's Day, at the core of our friends—at the core of our friendship, I remember the words of another great Irish poet, William Butler Yeats, who said, ""Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such friends.""
We celebrate the bonds of our friendship today, connecting millions of Irish Americans and the American people. We celebrate the friendship between two great nations, one that has shaped our past and strengthened our present and inspires our future.
So happy St. Patrick's Day, everybody.
And now I'd like to welcome the Taoiseach to the podium.
Prime Minister Varadkar. Mr. President, Senators, Representatives, Deputies, MLAs, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends: a chairde.
Before I start, I just wanted to very briefly acknowledge two special guests who flew here to be here today. They are Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe from Element Pictures, who made us very proud by winning four Oscars. So—[applause]. So thank you both so much for the encouragement that you give to other artists and other producers, and it's great to have you here today.
Mr. President, nearly 250 years ago, Irishmen fought as part of your independence struggle. And exactly 100 years ago, the United States became the first country to formally recognize the newly independent Irish state and establish diplomatic relations. The exchange of Ambassadors recognized the sacred promise that had been made between our peoples, forged over centuries, and reflecting the powerful bond between our countries.
This week, meeting so many proud Irish Americans, I've been thinking a lot about sacred promises. And I've been thinking, in particular, of the words of one courageous Irish American, a lawyer and a decorated war hero, who spoke so eloquently about the sacred promises that we make as leaders.
To quote his words, ""It's about the promises we make to our children, who deserve a chance to succeed""—the promises we make to each other, the sacred promise to work for a better future for all. Those were the words of Beau Biden.
And I know when we're elected to office, we each make a sacred promise to our communities, our party, our country, to ourselves, and we dedicate ourselves to honor it, not always succeeding, but always doing our best, no matter how challenging the circumstances.
President Biden, one of your country's most sacred promises is to defend the principles of democracy and freedom against tyranny and oppression. And when Ukraine was invaded, you honored that promise and stood firm against an adversary who tore up the rulebook of international law and repudiated our sacred humanity.
So, on behalf of Ireland and the wider European community, we commend your leadership and reaffirm that Europe stands with you and with Ukraine for as long as it takes. The battle lines are 5,000 miles away, but if Ukraine loses, Putin will soon threaten others closer to home. Dictators cannot be appeased. Dictators can only be defeated. And liberty must prevail.
This evening, in this White House, I'm also reminded by the words of another great Irish American President, John F. Kennedy, who spoke to the Oireachtas—the Irish Parliament—in the final months of his life.
President Kennedy issued a challenge to the Irish nation to be the protector of the weak and small. And when somebody dies before their time, as he did, their words can assume a kind of prophecy, a sort of sacred promise for the future.
As a country, we've tried to live up to the mission he set for us when he predicted that one day we would have something to give the world, ""a future of peace with freedom."" And those words resonate even more strongly today.
And tonight let us all reflect on the words of President Kennedy when he urged us to do the most important work of peace in protecting the weak and small and, as he said in the Irish Parliament, ""from Cork to Congo, from Galway to the Gaza Strip."" President Biden, when we met on Friday, we spoke of our shared hope for Israeli and Palestinian states living side by side in peace and security.
And I've always believed that America is a force for good in the world. You've helped to advance liberty and democracy around the globe. You saved Europe and the world from fascism in the 1940s, from communism after that. You stopped ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and Bosnia and helped bring peace to Ireland and unification to Germany. And today, you stand with us in our fight to save democracy and freedom in Ukraine.
Mr. President, as you know, the Irish people are deeply troubled about the catastrophe that's unfolding before our eyes in Gaza. And when I travel the world, leaders often ask me why the Irish have such empathy for the Palestinian people. And the answer is simple: We see our history in their eyes, a story of displacement, of dispossession and national identity questioned and denied, forced emigration, discrimination, and now hunger.
So we support your work and that of your administration to secure a humanitarian cease-fire and create—to create the space for lasting peace.
The people of Gaza desperately need food, medicine, and shelter. And most especially, they need the bombs to stop. This has to stop, on both sides, the hostages brought home, and humanitarian relief allowed in. Israel must reverse its precipitous decision to authorize a land incursion into Rafah.
And, after a hundred years of violence, as you said, the only secure future lies in two states, peaceful and sovereign, side by side. And Ireland stands ready to recognize a Palestinian state with like-minded partners when it's most helpful for peace.
Mr. President, we also see Israel's history reflected in our eyes: a diaspora whose heart never left home, no matter how many generations passed; a nation-state that was reborn; and a language revived.
I believe it's possible to be for Israel and for Palestine, and I believe you do too, because the life of a Palestinian child is equal to that of an Israeli one, and the aspiration of the Palestinian people to have a homeland and a fully fledged state in the land of their forefathers is equal to that of Israel's.
And I also believe there are lessons that can be drawn from our own peace process in Northern Ireland, particularly the concept of parity of esteem and the totality of relationships, and also the crucial role of America, which provided a chairman for our peace talks in Senator George Mitchell. There was a permanent secretariat, and America provided confidence and oversight.
Mr. President, as you know, today we're joined here in the White House by Michelle O'Neill as First Minister and Emma Little-Pengelly as Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, a joint office in which they are coequal, two courageous women, demonstrating every day what's possible by putting aside old animosities and working together.
The Good Friday Agreement is working again. And thank you all so much for making that possible. I think they've got off to a great start. And the Irish Government is working with them and the Executive in Belfast to build on the peace and prosperity that has been achieved in the last 26 years and to make sure it's shared by all.
And thank you, Mr. President, for your ongoing interest in Ireland and Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. We've known each other for many years, met on many occasions, and the only—your only ask has ever been: How can I help?
So thank you, Mr. President, for the warm welcome you've extended to me, the enormous amount of time you've given to me and my delegation on this very special occasion.

"Mar 19, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-observance-nowruz-7,Statement on the Observance of Nowruz,"""Today Jill and I send our best wishes to the millions of people around the world celebrating Nowruz, a time of reflection, renewal, and rebirth.
Generations of Americans have spread the hope of this holiday across every part of our Nation. We see it in the pastries and presents exchanged between family and friends. We hear it in the sound of children banging pots and in the laughs of families who've come together around the Haft-Sin table. And we feel it as communities gather to make this celebration such a joyous part of American culture, one that reflects the soul of who we are as a nation and reminds us that hope lies ahead.
This year, Nowruz comes at a difficult time for many, when this hope is needed more than ever. The United States will continue to stand with the courageous women of Iran, who are fighting for their freedoms. And together with our partners, we will hold Iranian officials to account for denying fundamental human rights. The war in Gaza has also inflicted terrible suffering on the Palestinian people, and we will continue to lead international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance to them, including urgently needed food, water, medicine and shelter.
We have decorated our Haft-Sin table at the White House to reflect our hopes and the potential and promise of the new year. And, as we mark the start of spring, we honor the diverse diaspora communities across our Nation, who have adapted old traditions anew to tell the ongoing story of America. To all who celebrate: Eid-eh Shoma Mobarak—we wish you a peaceful and joyous new year.""	Statement on the Observance of Nowruz"
"Mar 26, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-collapse-the-francis-scott-key-bridge-baltimore-maryland-and-exchange-with,"Remarks on the Collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, Maryland, and an Exchange With Reporters","""The President. Hello, folks. Sorry to keep you waiting. I was waiting to talk to the last member of the delegation in the region.
Good afternoon. Before I leave for North Carolina, which I'm going to do in a few minutes, I want to speak briefly about the terrible incident and accident that happened in Baltimore this morning.
At about 1:30, a container ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which I've been over many, many times commuting from the State of Delaware either on a train or by car. I've been to Baltimore Harbor many times. And the bridge collapsed, sending several people and vehicles into the water, into the river.
And multiple U.S. Coast Guard units—which are stationed very nearby, thank God—were immediately deployed, along with local emergency personnel. And the Coast Guard is leading the response at the port, where representatives from the Federal Highway Administration, the FBI, the Department of Transportation, the Army Corps of Engineers, as well as Maryland officials and Baltimore Police and Fire—they're all working together to coordinate an emergency response.
Officials at the scene estimate eight people were unaccounted for still—not still, were unaccounted for. That number might change. Two have been rescued, one without injury, one in critical condition. And the search-and-rescue operation is continuing for all those remaining as we speak.
I spoke with Governor Moore this morning as well as the mayor of Baltimore, the county executive, United two—both United States Senators, and the Congressman. And my Secretary of Transportation is on the scene. I told them we're going to send all the Federal resources they need as we respond to this emergency, and I mean all the Federal resources. And we're going to rebuild that port together.
Everything so far indicates that this was a terrible accident. At this time, we have no other indication, no other reason to believe there was any intentional act here.
Personnel on board the ship were able to alert the Maryland Department of Transportation that they had lost control of their vessel, as you all know and have reported. As a result, local authorities were able to close the bridge to traffic before the bridge was struck, which undoubtedly saved lives.
And our prayers are with everyone involved in this terrible accident and all the families, especially those waiting for the news of their loved one right now. I know every minute in that circumstance feels like a lifetime. You just don't know. It's just terrible.
And we're incredibly grateful for the brave rescuers who immediately rushed to the scene.
And to the people of Baltimore, I want to say: We're with you. We're going to stay with you as long as it takes. And like the Governor said, you're Maryland tough, you're Baltimore strong, and we're going to get through this together. And I promise: We're not leaving.
Here's what's happening now. The search-and-rescue operation is our top priority. Ship traffic in the Port of Baltimore has been suspended until further notice. And we'll need to clear that channel before the ship traffic can resume. The Army Corps of Engineers is on the spot and is going to help lead this effort to clear the channel.
The Port of Baltimore is one of the Nation's largest shipping hubs. And I've been there a number of times as a Senator and as a Vice President. It handled a record amount of cargo last year. It's also the top port in America for both imports and exports of automobiles and light trucks. Around 850,000 vehicles go through that port every single year, and we're going to get it up and running again as soon as possible.
Fifteen thousand jobs depend on that port. And we're going to do everything we can to protect those jobs and help those workers.
The bridge is also critical to—for travel, not just for Baltimore but for the Northeast corridor. Over 30,000 vehicles cross the Francis Scott Key Bridge on a daily basis. It's virtually the—well, it's one of the most important elements for the economy in the Northeast and the quality of life.
My Transportation Secretary is there now. As I told Governor Moore, I've directed my team to move heaven and earth to reopen the port and rebuild the bridge as soon as humanly possible. And we're going to work hand in hand with the support of Maryland—to support Maryland, whatever they ask for. And we're going to work with our partners in Congress to make sure the State gets the support it needs.
It's my intention that Federal Government will pay for the entire cost of reconstructing that bridge, and I expect to—the Congress to support my effort. This is going to take some time. And the people of Baltimore can count on us, though, to stick with them at every step of the way until the port is reopened and the bridge is rebuilt. You know, we're not leaving until this job gets done—not leaving until then.
So I just want to say God bless everybody who—everyone harmed this morning and their families, and may God bless the first responders, who—many of whom risking their lives.
And I'm going to—the reason I'm not going to take a lot of questions—there's remaining issues that are open that we've got to determine what's going to happen in terms of the rescue mission and the like. But I'll—I'm——

Q. Do you plan to go to Baltimore, sir? And if so, how quickly?
The President. I do and as quickly as I can. That's what we're working on——
Bridge Reconstruction 
Q. You said the Federal Government is also going to pay for the repairs. I'm just curious: This was a ship that appears to be at fault. Is there any reason to believe that the company behind the ship should be held responsible?
And then, also, you mentioned——
The President. That could be, but we're not going to wait if that happened. We're going to pay for it to get the bridge rebuilt and open.
Q. Mr. President——

Q. What did you make of Israel's decision not to attend this meeting this week?

Q. You mentioned the port——
Q. Mr. President, on the abortion——

Q. Can I ask about cars? 
Q. About the port——

"Mar 26, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-efforts-reduce-health-care-costs-raleigh-north-carolina,"Remarks on Efforts To Reduce Health Care Costs in Raleigh, North Carolina","""The President. Hello, hello, hello, Raleigh!
Please, all, have a seat. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please. Thank you.
Lori, thank you for that introduction and for sharing your story with us. As a daughter, a mom, a granddaughter—grandmother, I should say—you're doing everything you can to care for the family and for yourself while still taking care of others in need. You're incredible—pretty incredible.
And so is Kamala. She is really incredible.
As Vice President of the United States, as attorney general of California, Kamala always fought for people like Lori who stood for the basic truth that health care is a right—should be a right not just a privilege in America.
And I want to especially thank your incredible Governor, Roy Cooper—and by the way, he is an incredible Governor—and First Lady Kristin Cooper for welcoming us today and for their friendship.
You know, when I think of the Coopers, I think of one word, and I mean this sincerely—highest compliment I can give anybody who has ever been elected to office. They have enormous integrity. They have enormous integrity.
And because Roy Cooper never gave up, North Carolina finally extended—expanded Medicaid coverage, which already is helping 400,000 North Carolinians so far—400,000. That all by itself is a heck of a legacy.
I also want to thank your attorney general, Josh Stein, who defended ACA—and fought to expand Medicaid as well. He's an outstanding leader.
And, folks, look, speaking of great leaders and legacies, 14 years ago this week, I stood by —President Obama when he signed the Affordable Care Act into law—Obamacare. And as many of you know, I thought it was a big deal.
[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.]
[Laughter] Thank God my mom wasn't around. [Laughter]
Well, look, even as—it's even a bigger deal today. The Affordable Care Act is the most consequential health care since Medicare and Medicaid, and that's a fact.
It was always about millions of Americans lying in bed staring at the ceiling at night wondering, ""What will happen if I lose my insurance?""
I'll never forget, my dad came home one day. We lived in a three-bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop living with us. And my bedroom wall backed up to where they were. And I could hear my dad was restless as hell. I couldn't understand why.
And the next morning—I was 14 years old—I asked my mom, ""What's the matter?"" She said, ""Well, they just—he just lost his health insurance. The company he worked for no longer is paying for health insurance.""
You know, there's a lot of people lying in bed at night, staring at the ceiling, literally wondering: ""What will happen if my spouse gets cancer or my child gets seriously ill? Will I have enough insurance? Can we afford the medical bills? Will we have to sell the house? What are we going to have to do?""
Because of all of you in this room and across the country, we changed that and made the Affordable Care Act the law of the land.
But Donald Trump and his MAGA friends are, if nothing than—but persistent. They've tried to repeal it 50 times. Not a joke. Fifty times they've tried to repeal it, but we stopped them every time.
And now they just released a budget again. A hundred and twenty or a hundred and sixty—I'm not sure how many—of the House Members put out their budget for next year. They want to get rid of the Affordable Health Care Act again.
But I got news for them. [Laughter] We're going to stop them again.
Look, Kamala and I have come back to North Carolina to celebrate the ACA and to remind all of us that we can't take anything for granted.
Just think back before the ACA. A patient with a heart disease, diabetes, or a child with asthma couldn't get coverage. Why? Because the insurance company considered those a preexisting condition that allowed them to deny you coverage——
Audience member. What about health care in Gaza?
Audience member. What about the health care in Gaza?
The President. Everybody deserves health care.
Audience member. Hospitals in Gaza are being bombed! [Inaudible]
Audience member. Women are being raped! [Inaudible]
[The disruption in the audience continued.]
The President. Be patient with them.
They have a point. We need to get a lot more care into Gaza. [Applause]
But, folks, back to the subject at hand. Even pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition. Did you all know that?
Well—[laughter]—for all the young people out there, before ACA, you could get kicked off your parents' health care plans before you turned 26, just as you're heading out on your own. A lot has changed.
For so many other people, they couldn't leave a dead-end job or start their own business because they couldn't risk losing the health care they had where they were.
And imagine this: Prior to the ACA, many insurance companies imposed lifetime caps on how much coverage your insurance policy can give you—lifetime caps. That meant a cancer patient could be halfway through chemo when they reached the cap and their insurance cut out.
No, I'm serious. I know it sounds hard to believe. Many of you pray to God you haven't had to go through that. But companies would stop covering, and—that life was put in danger. They just cut off the insurance.
Think about that. At the most vulnerable point in their life, so many Americans heard these words: ""Sorry, you're on your own.""
Look, for God's sake, this is the United States of America. We're so much better than that. And that's why the Affordable Care Act is so important and why Kamala and I are making it stronger than ever before.
Folks, through laws I wrote and signed—the American Rescue Plan, the Inflation Reduction Act, both of which not a single, solitary Republican in the Congress voted for—I enacted tax credits that save an average of $800 per person per year, reducing health care premiums for millions of working families under the Affordable Care Act.
Those tax credits expire next year. I'm calling on Congress to make that $800 expanded affordable health care tax credit permanent. Otherwise, millions of Americans with that coverage could lose their coverage.
Folks, it's because we're making the ACA stronger and more affordable—ACA enrollment is breaking records. Today, everyone can get affordable coverage through the ACA. And 80 percent—80 percent—of the folks on the ACA plan can get a plan for $10 a month—$10 a month.
Twenty-one million people covered under ACA, a 75-percent increase just since Kamala and I came to office. And that includes over 1 million folks right here in North Carolina.
And on top of that, more Americans have health care today than any other—than under any other President, and it's saving the American taxpayers money. It saves money. They talk about we're spending—it saves the taxpayers money. It's cheaper to pay for a preventive mammogram than it is to treat a cancer.
And today, 100 million Americans can no longer be denied health insurance because of preexisting conditions, whether you get your insurance through ACA or not. Nearly 25 million low-income adults have gained Medicaid coverage because of ACA, including, as I said, 400,000 right here in North Carolina because of Roy Cooper.
And Kamala and I are making health care more affordable and accessible in other ways as well. Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere else in the world.
I could get you on Air Force One, and you tell me if you have a prescription to fill out here in North Carolina. I—say—take—I could fly you to Toronto, to Berlin, to London, to Rome, and I can get you that same prescription from that same company somewhere between 40 and 60 percent less than you pay for it here.
But through the Inflation Reduction Act—again, not a single Republican voted for it—we finally beat Big Pharma. Finally.
For example, instead of seniors with diabetes paying as much as $400 a month for their insulin they so badly need, they now only have to pay $35 a month, period. And by the way, you know how much it costs to make that insulin? Ten—t-e-n—dollars. Package it, everything: $12.50.
Folks, I want to extend those savings to everyone who needs lifesaving insulin, whether you're a senior or not—everyone. Everyone.
Folks—[applause]—and it saves the American taxpayers money. Guess what that one little act did when we passed it? It saves the American taxpayers $160 billion—$160 billion. They no longer have to pay $400. They pay $35, among other things.
Folks, for—people have talked about giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs the Federal Government pays just like VA pays. I've been fighting for that since I—and the Congressman and I have been fighting for that since we were almost kids in the Congress. [Laughter] Well, guess what? We finally got it done.
Now, that's not just saving seniors money. As I said, it's saving taxpayers, and the Federal deficit is down by $160,000—160 million [billion; White House correction] bucks in the next 10 years. Medicare will no longer have to pay exorbitant, big prices.
Because of the law I signed, Medicare is able to continue to negotiate lower prices for some other of the costliest drugs—for example, for heart disease, for arthritis. Now it's time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for even more drugs over the next decade.
This along with other nations—and other actions we've taken—but this first time for us—will not only save lives, it's going to save the taxpayers an additional $200 billion on top of the 160. This saves money. Saves money.
Because the law I signed, starting next year, we've capped total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year no matter what the total costs are, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $14-, $15,000 a year. It's going to be capped at $2,000 a year and save a hell of a lot more money as well.
And, folks, I want to make sure that's available for everyone. That's my objective in a second term.
And by the way, the pharmaceutical company will still make billions of dollars. They're not going to go broke.
Folks, here's the deal. My predecessor and MAGA Republicans in Congress have a different plan. Let's remember 4 years ago this month we saw how my predecessor didn't care much about science and reason.
During the pandemic that went on to claim 1 million American lives—and for every life claimed, it's estimated there's between 8 and 10 people left behind—Trump didn't level with the American people. He told Americans all they had to do was inject bleach in themselves. Remember that? Not a joke. You'd think I'm making this up if you were—""Just take a—or take a real shot—of UV light.""
Even before the pandemic, my Republican—Republicans in Congress were hell-bent on getting rid of the ACA, and they came within one vote. But a close friend of mine—we used to argue like hell, but we spent a lot of time together over the years. But it failed because of my deceased friend John McCain going like this.
[The President made a thumbs-down gesture.]
But even during the deadly pandemic, Trump and his MAGA friends in Congress wanted to get rid of the ACA, kick millions of Americans off their health insurance.
It's sick.
Now they want to, quote—his word—""terminate"" the ACA, as my predecessor says. If that ever were to happen, we'd also terminate a lot of lives as well. But we're not going to let that happen, are we?
Audience members. No!
The President. We're not going to let that happen.
Here's what it would mean if they get rid of the ACA.
Because of Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans in Congress, 45 million people nationwide would lose their health insurance, including 1.4 million right here in North Carolina. A hundred million Americans with preexisting conditions, from heart disease to asthma, could lose their protection as well. And millions of young people, like a 20-year-old kid who just graduated from college could be kicked off his parent's plan because he can't stay on until he's 26 any longer.
Trump and the MAGA Republican officials want to take us back where cancer patients were cut off from insurance halfway through the chemo because they'd reached what they call ""their limit"" and that—what their willing to pay—the insurance company.
They want to take us back when women could be charged more for health care and preventive services like mammograms and they'd no longer be free.
And—I'm serious—this is what—if you didn't know any better, you'd think I'm making this stuff up.
But they aren't stopping there. MAGA Republicans in Congress just proposed a plan to get rid of the power of Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drugs, which could drive the cost of insulin back to 400 bucks a month instead of $35 for seniors and so much more. No, I'm—this is their—they plan to slash Medicaid as a result. It could close out a hundred rural hospitals—hundreds of rural hospitals.
You know how these rural hospitals make it? They make it because of the health care plans that—made available through the ACA. That's how they can afford to stay open. So many across the country—rural plans are closing because they couldn't keep it open. They couldn't afford to stay open.
The Republican plan would deny millions of seniors with diabetes [disabilities; White House correction] access to quality long-term care they get now under Medicaid.
That includes 30 million children who now have access to Medicaid—they'd be at risk of losing that coverage as well.
Trump also recently said, about Social Security and Medicare—he said, quote—I'm quoting—""There's a lot you can do in terms of cutting. Tremendous amount of things you can do""—if you cut.
Right on cue, the same budget that 180 House Republicans just proposed to gut Medicare and Medicaid—they'd also raise Social Security retirement age and slash Medicare, giving billions of dollars in tax breaks to the very wealthy instead. They proposed another $2 trillion tax cut. They raised the debt—larger than anybody did in f4 years, and they're going to—about to do it again if they win.
I have a better idea. I'll protect Social Security and Medicare.
Instead of giving the very wealthy another $2 billion—$2 trillion tax cut, I'm going to make sure the wealthy begin to finally pay their fair share of taxes to sustain these programs.
Folks, my predecessor and MAGA officials are going after seniors and people with disabilities and children. As we all know, they're going after women as well.
Trump proudly says, quote, ""After 50 years with no one coming close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade."" That's his statement. You've seen it on television.
Well, he's talking about how Donald Trump killed Roe v. Wade. He says it has to be ""punishment"" for women exercising their reproductive freedom.
Trump and MAGA Republicans are responsible for the chaos that followed, and they're now calling for a national ban on choice for every State—in every State, not just what is in law now.
On top of that, just this morning, the Supreme Court heard a case to gut access to a medication that was approved by the FDA 20 years ago to give women a choice.
Folks, if America sends me a Congress that are Democrats, I promise you, Kamala and I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again. [Applause] We will.
Folks, look, let me close with this. History is made when you decide there's a greater risk in doing nothing rather than doing something when it comes to the health and well-being of the nation.
Through the leadership of President Obama, we made history with the Affordable Care Act. And while there are those who want to take us back in time, all of us together are determined to move us forward. And here's the future I see.
I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish democracy. I see a future where health care is a right and we restore the freedom to choose and protect the freedoms, not to—and not take it away. I see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and the wealthy begin to pay their fair share.
Folks, you notice the leading economists aren't making much fun of Bidenomics anymore. They're thinking maybe it works to build from the middle out and the bottom up. The wealthy can still be very wealthy.
You know how many billionaires there are in America? There's now a thousand billionaires. You know what their average tax they pay—Federal tax? Eight-point-two percent. Anybody want to trade with a billionaire—their tax rate? [Laughter]
Well, guess what? If they just paid 25 percent—it's not the highest bracket by a longshot—25 percent—do you know what that would do? That would raise $40—$400 billion over the next 10 years.
Imagine what we could do with that. We could fundamentally slash the Federal deficit. We could make sure there's home care. We could do so many things—consequential—including finally making sure that we take care of Ukraine from that butcher Putin.
Look, I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. Above all, a future for all Americans, for a country of all Americans, and I'll always be President for all Americans.
I've never been more optimistic about our future. And I know I'm only 40 years old—[laughter]—times 2, plus 1. [Laughter]
Look, we just have to remember who in God's name we are. And I mean this sincerely, and I'll end with this. We're the United States of America.
No, I'm serious. We're the United States of America. We're the only country in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in—the only country in the world. There is nothing beyond our capacity when we act together—not a single thing.
This is the United States of America. Let's get together and get it done.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[As the President was joined on stage by Vice President Kamala D. Harris and Gov. Roy A. Cooper III of North Carolina, he turned to shake Gov. Cooper's hand.]
The President. This is the guy, right here, one of the best Governors in America. All right. [Inaudible]
Vice President Harris. ——Joe, all right.
[The President turned to greet Vice President Harris.]
The President. Oh, there you are. I was wondering when you were going to come out. [Laughter]
Vice President Harris. I'm right here.
The President. Thanks, everybody.
Every time I'd walk out of my grandfather's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Let's go spread the faith, guys.
Thank you.""	Remarks on Efforts To Reduce Health Care Costs in Raleigh, North Carolina"

Clinton in a Question-and-Answer Session Moderated by Stephen T. Colbert at a Campaign Reception in New York City,"""President Obama. Hey!
President Biden. I think I should go home.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
President Obama. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
President Biden. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
CBS ""Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" Host Stephen T. Colbert. Thank you. Good evening, everybody. I'm your moderator, Stephen Colbert, for what I'll hope—will be a lively conversation this evening between these three gentlemen.
Mr. Presidents, thank you so much for joining me this evening.
President Obama. Good to see you.
Mr. Colbert. This is an—such an exciting and rare occasion: Three Presidents have all come to New York, and not one of them is here to appear in court. [Laughter]
Now, before we begin, just a few ground rules, gentlemen. You are all very intelligent men who have at one time or another been the most powerful person in the world. And on top of that, you are all, shall we say, champion talkers. [Laughter] We have limited time together here, so I'm going to hold you two gentlemen—President Obama, President Clinton—I'm going to hold you to 5-minute answers. [Laughter] There will be an audio cue to let you know when to stop talking. It will sound like this: Please stop talking. [Laughter]
President Biden, because you are the sitting President and—you get 7 minutes, because as the sitting President, you can order SEAL Team Six to take me out—[laughter]—which, according to Donald Trump's lawyers, is perfectly okay to do. [Laughter]
Every election cycle, we're told that this election is the most important election in our lives. And here we are in 2024, and this election really feels like the most important election of our lives when it comes to rights and freedoms and the heart and the soul and the future of our country.
First question for you, President Biden. How would you describe what's at stake in this election?
2024 Presidential Election 
President Biden. I think our democracy is at stake. Not a joke. I think democracy is literally at stake.
Look, I wasn't going to run in 2020, because I just lost my son Beau a little earlier and—until I watched what happened down in Virginia when those folks came out of the fields carrying torches and Nazi flags and accompanied by White supremacists. And a young woman was killed, a bystander.
And when the President was a—former President was asked what he thought of that, he said, ""There are very fine people on both sides.""
Think of the things he said. Think of the things he's done; the things he says he wants to do—he's indicated that he really wants to have the first day of his new term—quote, unquote—will be one where he engages in absolute autonomy that he can do whatever he wants to do; the way he talks about people; the way he characterizes people.
I think a lot is at stake, but I'm really hopeful. Because I think we get by this election—not because of me, but we get by this election—we're in a position where we can set the course for the next four or five, six decades in a way that can make us much, much better. I really mean it. And, again, not because of me. We're at a real inflection point in history, because things are changing.
This guy denies there's global warming. This guy wants to get rid of not only Roe v. Wade, but he—which he brags about having done, he wants to get rid of the ability of anyone anywhere in America to ever choose.
I mean, all the things he's doing are so old—speaking of old. [Laughter] And you know, he—a little old and out of shape. But anyway. [Laughter]
Mr. Colbert. President Obama and President Clinton, is there anything you—you'd like to add to that sense of urgency?
President Obama. Well, I think it's worth adding that it's not just the negative case against the presumptive nominee on the other side, it's the positive case for somebody who's done an outstanding job in the Presidency.
Well, it's—sometimes, we forget where we started and where we are now. You've got record-breaking job growth. You've got an unemployment rate that is as low as it has been, for African Americans, by the way, the lowest on record ever. You've got extraordinary progress building off the work we did: first, Bill Clinton passing the Children's Health Insurance Act; we passed the Affordable Care Act.
Joe Biden takes the baton. He's now expanded coverage; made sure that seniors are seeing big discounts in their prescription drugs, capping—insulin drug prices—capping the price of insulin at 35 bucks, where it used to cost them up to $400—you know, helping young people go to college—the record-setting investment in clean energy that's going to transition us to the kind of future that our children and grandchildren deserve.
So—and we could obviously go on. The point is—am I at 5 minutes yet? [Laughter]
Mr. Colbert. You have 30 seconds.
President Biden. Keep going. You're sounding good. [Laughter]
President Obama. The President of the United States says I can go longer. [Laughter] But the point I'm——
Mr. Colbert. You cede some of your time to this gentleman? [Laughter]
President Obama. The point is, you know, that—look, passions get stirred by what we're against. And Joe is absolutely right that we've got not just a nominee, but frankly, a party and an entire infrastructure that increasingly seems unconcerned with the essence of America—right?—the idea of self-governance—and the possibilities of us all cooperating and bridging our differences and moving forward.
But we also have a positive story to tell about the future. And that is something that Joe Biden has worked on diligently each and every day on behalf of working Americans, and I expect him to continue to do that for the next 4 years and 8 months.
President Clinton. He's really done a good job. [Laughter] And I think the way you opened this—we talked about the defense to democracy—begs not only support for President Biden, but also begs the question of why are we even arguing about some of this stuff?
I'll tell you what's old. What's old is the United States of America. We are the longest lasting, free democracy in the history of the world. And one of our Republican predecessors, Dwight Eisenhower, said he worried whether when times got tough and arguments got hot, Americans would be strong enough to preserve their democracy.
And we have to realize that in order to do that, no one is going to be right all the time. A broken clock is right twice a day. [Laughter] And the rest of us are compelled to spend our freeing lives going back and forth between trying to be right all the time and at least trying to be—do better than being right twice a day.
Into that mess that President Biden inherited was a very vibrant, diverse society and economy. And you know, President Trump—let's be honest—had pretty good couple of years because he stole them from Barack Obama. [Laughter] I mean——
President Biden. That's true.
President Obama. Thank you. Thank you.
President Clinton. But look——
President Obama. The Obama-Biden economy for those first 2 years. But, please, continue.
President Clinton. But look——
President Obama. I'm going to give him an extra minute. [Laughter]
President Clinton. No, it's true. I listened to him tell us how terrible the American economy was all during 2016. And then, by January of 2017, after the Inauguration, it had become wonderful—[laughter]—miraculously, overnight. [Laughter]
Well, what happened was, actually, job growth under President Trump was slower than it was under President Obama in his last term. But people didn't feel it. It takes a while to feel it.
So then he claimed credit for everything. Then, all of a sudden, Joe Biden comes along and creates roughly twice as many jobs in 3 years as he did. And so I believe in keeping score. [Laughter] And not in a vindictive way, but in a positive way.
He's been good for America, and he deserves another term. And democracy around the world needs him.
President Biden. Thank you.
Mr. Colbert. Mr. President, I want to point out that we are 10 minutes in, and I have asked one question. [Laughter]
So I'm going to do a quick lightning round here. We're going to get back to some policy, some ideas here. But a quick lightning round here.
Do any of you have plans to sell golden sneakers or $60 Bibles? [Laughter] Show of hands. Show of hands. We'll do this debate.
No? Okay, no. All right.
President Biden. No golden sneakers.
Mr. Colbert. Yes. [Laughter]
President Obama and President Clinton, what do you miss about being President? Is it nice to live in the White House, or do you always feel like you're in a museum? For you also, President Biden, is it a nice place to live? I know it's pretty, but do you always feel like you're, you know, walking around the corner——
President Clinton. No.
Mr. Colbert. ——and there will be a gift shop? [Laughter]
President Clinton. I loved living there. I mean—and the last time I walked in, the day before I left, I landed on Air—the Marine One helicopter and I walked in, I was just as idealistic and hopeful about America as the day I showed up.
But I support the two-term limit. I believe that no one should serve forever in a democracy. And—but I do miss, on occasion, especially when I think President Biden's getting the raw deal—I think, ""Boy, I wish I were there to push back."" Because I think—because I think he's done a good job and because I think democracy is on the line all around the world.
It's not surprising that freedom and democracy are being questioned. There are no such things as permanent victories in politics. But I do believe——
Audience member. [Inaudible]
President Clinton. ——that's good.
Mr. Colbert. For people watching at home——
President Clinton. You want to say anything?
Mr. Colbert. Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Presidents.
Audience member. [Inaudible]
Mr. Colbert. For people who are watching—who are watching at home on the feed, you may not be able to hear that there's some protesters here who——
Audience member. [Inaudible]
Mr. Colbert. Hold on a second here.
Audience member. [Inaudible]
Mr. Colbert. There's some protesters here who are no doubt related to the protests we saw across the street. Everyone in here saw the protests across the street before we came in.
Gaza Conflict/Humanitarian Situation/Hamas Attacks on Israel/Peace Process 
And this is a subject I was going to get to later, but as long as this—it's been brought up here, Mr. Biden, I wanted to ask you this question.
As the leader of the United States and as a leader of the alliance of democratic nations, and also aware of the moral leadership that the United States provides to the entire world, there are people outside and people in this room, I'm sure, who have passionate divisions about what they think the best course of action is for the crisis in Israel and Gaza right now.
What do you believe the United States role should be going forward to ensure the most peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Israel and for Gaza—these two people, who the world sees and for whom the world's heart breaks?
President Biden. Well, both these gentlemen——
Audience members. [Inaudible]
President Biden. That's all right. Let them go. Let them go.
Look, there's a lot of people who are very, very—there are too many innocent victims, Israeli and Palestinians. We've got to get more food and medicine and supplies in to the Palestinians. We're working like hell to do that. We've got to open more opportunities.
But you can't forget that Israel is in a position where its very existence is at stake. You have—you have all those people—1,200 people. Now, they weren't—they weren't killed; they were massacred. They were massacred.
And imagine if that had happened in the United States. And the—tying a mom and her daughter together, pouring kerosene on them, burning her to death. There's—it's understandable Israel has such a profound anger. And Hamas is still there.
But we must, in fact, stop the effort to—that is resulting in significant deaths of innocent civilians and, particularly, children. And we can.
And I won't go into detail now. But look, I've been working with the Saudis and with all the other Arab countries, including Egypt and Jordan and Qatar. They are prepared to fully recognize Israel—fully recognize Israel—first time.
But we have to—there has to be a post-Gaza plan here, and there has to be a train to a two-state solution. Doesn't have to occur today, but it has to be a progression. And I think we can do that. I think we can do that.
And that's why we're seeing more avenues open into Israel—excuse me, into Gaza to bring food and medicine. And there's much more we can do. But I'm confident it can be done and Israel's integrity, Israel security, Israel's—Israel nationally can be preserved.
We can do this.
President Obama. You asked earlier about being in the White House. [Laughter] No, no, no. You know, you'll see there's some relevance here. [Laughter]
It is a lonely seat. I mean, one of the things I miss is the incredible team that you have around you. You have some of the smartest, most dedicated, selfless people who are every day sacrificing—you know, their families are sacrificing. They are putting heroic, Herculean efforts into just trying to make the world a little better——
President Biden. And every time you show up at the White House, they all come and thank you.
President Obama. Well, they——
President Biden. No, no, no. I'm not joking. The affection for you is overwhelming.
President Obama. Well, I appreciate that. But here's the thing. So you have this incredible, you know, team. And I think Bill and I—we've talked about it—that's one of the things you miss most. But although it's a team, you're still ultimately the person who has to make the calls.
And one of the realities of the Presidency is that the world has a lot of joy and beauty, but it also has a lot of tragedy and cruelty. And there's history there. And you don't start from scratch. And you don't have neat, easy answers to really hard problems.
And I think people, understandably, oftentimes want to feel a certain, you know, purity in terms of how those decisions are made. But a President doesn't have that luxury.
And so, when you look at a situation like we're seeing in Gaza and in Israel, and your heart breaks initially for a massacre of unbelievable cruelty, it is also possible for us to say we unequivocally support the people of Israel and their ability to live and raise families and so forth, which is what Joe's position has been and my position was and Bill Clinton's position was—and every American President, and it is also possible for us to have our hearts broken watching innocent people being killed——
President Biden. That's right.
President Obama. ——and trying to manage through that in a way that ultimately leads to both people being able to live in peace, side by side. But that is not an easy task.
And so the reason I think I—the reason——
Audience member. [Inaudible]
President Obama. No, listen—and it's—but here's the thing: You can't just talk and not listen—because that's part of democracy. Part of democracy is not just talking; it's listening. That's what the other side does.
And it is important for us to understand that it is possible to have moral clarity and have deeply held beliefs, but still recognize that the world is complicated, and it is hard to solve these problems.
And the thing that—the reason why I originally selected Joe Biden to be my Vice President, the reason that I think he was one of the best Vice Presidents we've ever had, and the reason why I think he has been an outstanding President is because he has moral conviction and clarity, but he also is willing to acknowledge that the world is complicated and that he's willing to listen to all sides in this debate and every other debate and try to see if we can find common ground. That's the kind of President I want.
I don't want a President who thinks he's got the right answer every single time and is not—not only not willing to listen the other side but demonizing the other side. And we should value that decency in Joe Biden. That's one of the reasons I'm going to be working hard for him.
President Clinton. I know there are many other things we need to talk about tonight, but I believe that this is one of the most important reasons to reelect President Biden. And I'll explain why.
Because he genuinely cares about preserving the existence of Israel, which Hamas doesn't. And he genuinely cares about giving the Palestinians a decent state, self-governance, and the support they need for self-determination. And you've got to do both.
Look, this—the world we live in is hard, because you have to keep two apparently conflicting ideas in your head at the same time. But don't forget, those of you who—particularly if you're younger and all you know is Israelis' Government is denying the rights of the Palestinians. Perhaps my closest friend among other world leaders was Yitzhak Rabin—who got himself killed standing for a Palestinian state.
And so, when Joe Biden says he wants a two-state solution, we all lived through the same things. He's not making this up. We lived this. And you should trust him to work for it, to work to ease the suffering of the totally innocent Palestinian citizens and not to allow Israel's security to be lost over a bitter difference between the legitimacy of the Palestinians to statehood, which we agree with—all three of us. So——
Mr. Colbert. President Biden, 3 weeks ago, you gave an energetic State of the Union Address.
Yes.
President Obama. It was energetic.
Civil Unrest and Violence at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021/Former President Donald J. Trump 
Mr. Colbert. And for almost 8,000 words, you never said your predecessor's name. [Laughter] And a lot of people out there complained that there's ""Trumpnesia,"" people don't remember what it was like when he was President. And I remember what it was like. I remember, particularly, how it came to its apotheosis on that terrible day on January 6. I remember my feelings that day. But I have never heard you talk about what was going through your mind that day. What were you thinking when you saw that unfold?
President Biden. Look, we had no President on January the 6th. [Laughter] No, no, no. No, I'm not being a wise guy. There was an insurrection happening.
Audience member. Shame on you, Joe Biden!
President Biden. And here's what happened.
Audience member. Shame on you!
President Biden. I was supposed to make a speech on the economy.
Audience member. [Inaudible]
President Biden. And I decided I couldn't remain silent. So what I did was, I made a speech about January the 6th—what was happening. And I said there was an insurrection underway and it must be dealt with. And I pled with the President to stop and do his job, call these people off.
He sat there in the dining room off the Oval Office for several hours and watched. Didn't do a damn thing.
And that's why I felt obliged—even though I wasn't sworn in yet; I was President-elect—that I went out and said, ""This is what we should be doing,"" and laid it out.
And here's what's happened since then. What's happened since then—it's not only is—he said it wasn't an insurrection. He says that what was happening was totally legitimate, that these people were patriots. He's calling them ""patriots."" You notice he starts off all his rallies with them singing from prison and him interjecting with the—I think it's the of Pledge of Allegiance or whatever. I'm not sure exactly what he does with it.
But the end result of it is that he says he wants to free—if he's reelected, he's going to pardon all of them—pardon them. What—what is—and look——
Audience members. Boo!
President Biden. No, no—no—and by the way, he means it. He means it.
And here's what's going to happen. You know, when—we went up on Inauguration Day, and these guys were there—on Inauguration Day, you walk through the corridors—broken glass, smattered statues, the actual place we get sworn in was—was a mess because these guys had rampage—rampaged through it.
And look, I'll give—one real quick story. First time I went to the G-7 meeting—that's the meeting of the European heads of state and—as President and—end of January. And I sat down and I said, ""America is back."" And the French leader looked at me, and he said, ""For how long?"" [Laughter] It wasn't humorous. He said for—he was serious. ""For how long?""
And then the German Chancellor looked at me. He said: ""What would you think, Mr. President, if in fact you picked up the paper tomorrow and found out here in Great Britain, on the London Times, the headline says, 'Mob storms Parliament, breaks down the door of the House of Commons to protest the election and two bobbies were killed.' What would you think back in America?""
And think about that. What would you think if another democracy—and not just a leading democracy in the world, but another democracy—went through this thing? What would happen if—what would you say? And the rest of the world looks to us.
Look, we are the essential nation. And that's not pounding our chest. Everybody in the world looks to us. Imagine what would happen—Madeleine Albright, your Secretary of State, was right when she talked about ""we are the essential nation."" And we have to lead.
And when we look like we're countenancing this unruly—and, like, saying, ""You know, I'm going to—I'm going to be a dictator on the first day."" He's not joking. And he's serious about it. And it really shakes the entire foundation of the world, in terms of what's going on.
So that's why we have to—and, lastly, when did you think you'd ever have a President of the United States whose people he talked about—he sends—talks about love letters with the North Korean dictator. He talks about his closeness with Putin and what—and Kim Jong—I mean, this is a guy who has a perverse view of the world in terms of—[applause]. No, I—mean it. Anyway——
Mr. Colbert. Presidents Obama and Clinton, you know, you both know how this office works, obviously, and the extent of power and the pitfalls of power. When Donald Trump was President, what kept you up at night? And before—you answer, while I'm flattered, you can't both say my show. [Laughter] I get it, and I'm flattered. And thank you. [Laughter]
What kept you up at night about that Presidency?
President Obama. I want to emphasize the point Joe just made about how deeply that 4-year stretch affected views of America around the world.
America is imperfect. We have not always abided by our founding documents. We—a Civil War and enormous struggles were fought to try to perfect our Union. And we, in our actions overseas, sometimes did not live up to our ideals.
But what has always made America exceptional is this radical idea that you can get people from every corner of the globe—don't look alike, don't have the same name, worship differently, speak different languages, have different cultural traditions—and somehow they're going to come together under a set of rules and we're all going to pledge that's our creed: that we can live together, self-governing, have a representative government, peacefully transfer power. And that ideal matters. It matters to our children and their grandchildren, but it also matters around the world.
When we see a deemphasis, when America is not forthright in speaking on behalf of those ideals, you see backsliding around the world. You see authoritarians emboldened around the world. You see aggression around the world because there's no check.
And when we're living up to those ideals, even in difficult times, things feel a little bit better, not just here, but elsewhere, people are a little bit more hopeful.
So what would keep me up during those 4 years was: How badly are those ideals tarnished?
The good news is that people still want to believe in those ideals. They want to believe in human rights. They want to believe in freedom of speech and religion. And they want to believe in the idea that all people are equal.
Women are equal and have the right to control their bodies and, you know, shouldn't be subject to domestic violence. And girls should be able to go to school just like everybody else.
And people of different sexual orientations should have the same rights and protections.
And religious minorities and ethnic minorities and racial minorities all deserve the same respect and are afforded the same dignity as everybody else.
Those ideas, they can ebb and flow depending on what happens in the White House.
And the good news is that we had a period of time where those ideals were not just deemphasized but were violated, and then we have somebody come back in who says, ""No, no, that's—we do believe in the—this is what America is about.""
And that's the same test that we're going to be undergoing over the next 8 months: Do we, in fact, believe in those basic ideals? And if we do, not only are we going to be okay, but the world is going to be okay.
President Biden. You know, one of the things Barack—think about this. This is not hyperbole. We are the most unique nation in the world in this sense. Every other nation was founded based on geography, ethnicity, religion. None of—that's not us. We're—we came about as a consequence of an idea—an idea. No, I'm serious. Think about it.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator—we—that's what found—that's what—the basis of our existence. That's what—that's why we're found.
We didn't—we haven't always lived up to it, but we've never fully walked away from it—until now, someone is contemplating walking away from it completely.
Our diversity is our strength. It's the reason why the rest of the world looks to us.
President Clinton. But this is the big reason you should win. [Laughter] And that is that everything you said is true, but it only works if we all live under the same set of rules, we all have an equal set of chances to make it, and we treat each other with respect. We fight our differences. We have our arguments.
And I'll never forget a prominent member of the other party on the right once looked at my Chief of Staff and said, ""You and the President actually think we should all live under the same set of rules, don't you?"" [Laughter] He said, ""Yes, that's what we thought being an American was all about it."" He said: ""Well, we don't believe that. We think we should first do what's best for our party, then argue about the rest.""
That's what's at the heart of this. Joe Biden has bent over backwards to reach out to members of the other party to negotiate in good faith to solve problems, including on the border. And——
President Biden. And they did.
President Clinton. And in the case of the border, his apparent opponent basically said, ""Hey,"" to his own party, ""you can't do that. Get off of that bill. We need a problem, not a solution, at the border."" Well——
President Biden. That's a fact.
President Clinton. ——you know, I think life has plenty of problems. [Laughter] You know, your kids can get sick——
President Obama. You don't have to manufacture them.
President Clinton. Yes. Yes, you—we don't have to make them up. And—but the problem is, they're good at branding and blaming and we don't like their solution so much.
He's good at finding solutions people are actually glad they embraced. And that's why he should win.
Mr. Colbert. We are running short on time. And I know you're all busy men. You've got to go run the world. [Laughter]
Here's an important question. All three of you have been on Air Force One. You still have the keys, Mr. Biden. That's made by Boeing, right? [Laughter] Do those doors stay on? Before you get on, do you send on Pete Buttigieg with a socket wrench set to tighten them—tighten the bolts? [Laughter]
Air Force One 
President Biden. I don't sit by the door. [Laughter] Obviously, I'm only kidding. And I shouldn't even joke about it. I shouldn't even joke.
Mr. Colbert. A fine American company.
President Biden. And by the way, the one thing I can tell you about Air Force One: We're not changing the color.
Oh, he tried——
Mr. Colbert. We have——
President Biden. Trump wanted to change the color.
President Obama. Yeah, we're not doing that. [Laughter]
Mr. Colbert. Since the State of the—sir, did you want to—[inaudible].
President Obama. No, no, no. I have nothing——
Mr. Colbert. Since the State of the Union, President Biden, you've been busy. You've been in Raleigh, Saginaw, Milwaukee, Phoenix, Vegas, Hotlanta, the Philly suburbs, Manchester, Dallas, and Houston. Donald Trump, as far as we can tell, has just been trying to win a third championship at his own golf course. [Laughter]
Golf 
My question to you, sir: Can voters trust a Presidential candidate who has not won a single Trump International Golf Club trophy? At long last, sir, have you no chip shot? [Laughter]
President Biden. Well, look, I'd be happy to play. I told him this before, when he came into the Oval when he was being—before he got sworn in. I said, ""I'll give you three strokes if you carry your own bag."" [Laughter]
And I've only played 21 holes since I've been President. [Laughter]
Mr. Colbert. President Obama, I've been lucky enough to spend some time with you and your wife. She has repeatedly asked me to call her Michelle—which I now do. I say, ""Hello, Michelle.""
I continue to call you, ""Mr. President""—[laughter]—because you have never invited me to call you anything else. [Laughter] So my question is, to Presidents Biden and Clinton, don't you think, at this point, I should be able to call him ""Barack?"" Because it's weird. I went to your house, and I said: ""Hello, Michelle. Hello, Mr. President."" [Laughter] I'm not asking for ""Barry."" [Laughter] Come on.
President Obama. No. [Laughter]
Mr. Colbert. Doesn't that feel weird? [Laughter]
President Obama. Nope. [Laughter] Your wife can. I like her. [Laughter] She's here tonight. Lovely.
Mr. Colbert. She's——
President Obama. That's the only reason you might get another invitation. [Laughter]
President Biden. By the way, every time——
President Obama. Next question. Move on.
President Biden. I told these guys, for the first 2 years—for real—every time I'd be introduced, they play ""Hail to the Chief,"" I'd turn around—""Where the hell are they?"" [Laughter] ""Where""——
Mr. Colbert. You were this man's Vice President for 8 very exciting years. What—on your first day in the Oval Office as the President, did you learn anything and immediately you went, ""He could have told me about this""? [Laughter]
The Presidency 
President Biden. Well, I learned that what the President—I'd always kid the President. I'd get to be the last person to speak with him, give him my advice. And I'd—he'd thank me, and I'd walk out knowing he has to make the decision. That's the big difference.
And as Harry Truman said: ""You're President. If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog."" [Laughter] I got one, and he bit a Secret Service agent, so I don't know. [Laughter]
Mr. Colbert. Before we go, President Biden, there have been a lot of jokes about your age. And I've done a lot of them. And—[laughter]—and they've been very successful. Thank you—[laughter]—for that.
What would you like to say to the people who think that you're too seasoned for the job?
Perceptions of the President's Age/Former President Donald J. Trump 
President Biden. Well, I don't know about seasoned, but I hope they—they're not too old—they're old ideas. You know, this last guy that I ran against and running against again this time is—his ideas are from the 18th, 19th century. [Laughter]
No, I mean—I'm serious. He talks—the way he talks about what he—the way he says he going to suspend the Constitution, all the things he says.
But look, I think that there is, if you pay attention—if you've been around a while, no matter what your background is—if you pay attention, you know, the one thing age does bring is a little bit of wisdom. And I hope——
Now, I know I don't look much over 40. I know that. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, I think that one of the advantages that I've had: I got to work for and with both of these men. I got to serve in the Senate a long time, and I got to know the place.
And I think at least—like, for example, when we got elected, everybody told me we couldn't do any of the things we got done—literally anything. We couldn't get the—we couldn't get anything done. We couldn't get the CHIPS Act. We couldn't get the veterans—all these things we were told we couldn't get done.
But there are still enough people in the Republican Party—this is not your father's Republican Party. This is a different breed of cat. This is the—about 30 to 40 percent are the MAGA Republicans. And I don't know what—the thing that disturbs me most is, I don't know what it is that a—that my predecessor has on these guys, why they—why they're not stepping up more like Liz Cheney and others. Because I know that they don't like a lot of what's going on.
And, for example, these guys are not going to vote against—they don't want to vote against raising the age of Social Security. They don't want to cut Social Security benefits. They don't want to end the whole—they don't like the idea what's happened in Roe v. Wade.
By the way, you elect me, we're going to restore Roe v. Wade. Anyway——
I see those three zeros on that clock. So I'm going to hush up——
Mr. Colbert. Yes, we are just——
President Biden. ——as my mother would say.
Mr. Colbert. ——we are just out about time here.
But before we go, I wanted to talk to you, President Clinton, for just a moment. You oversaw a rapidly growing economy in the 1990s. And you oversaw a huge increase in our economy.
What do you think people need to know, who might be watching, the voters out there, who may not yet see or feel in their pocket the growth of the Biden economy?
President Clinton. Well, I think, first of all, there's two things we've been through since I left the White House that changed the rules for everybody.
One was the financial crash of 2008, which marred and limited what President Obama could accomplish early and required him to invest a lot of Government money to try to jumpstart the economy in a program that he put President Biden, then Vice President, in charge of running, and he did a heck of a good job.
Now—and we had good recovery, but we were—they were criticized for the deficit spending. But the truth is, when interest rates are zero or negative, you have to invest money, and only the Government can do it. And there was a $3 trillion hole in the economy that they spent $800 billion starting to fill. It worked great.
But by the end of President Obama's 8 years, we had a roaring economy, but people didn't feel it yet. It normally takes 2 or 3 years of real changes before people knew it.
So, when Donald Trump got elected by telling everybody how terrible it was, all of a sudden, the day after he was elected, he said how great it was. [Laughter] And it was, but it was pretty great the day before it too. [Laughter]
So, anyway, now, we had COVID. It was devastating in human ways, in economic ways. So, President Biden gets in, and he doesn't want to under suit the way the Republicans required President Obama to do back when he was President. So he says, ""Give me this big recovery program,"" which is not everything he asked for, but it was big and robust. And he starts to implement it. And he gets criticized because not all the programs were solved the day after tomorrow.
But you know the whole structure of the international economy, the supply chains, everything was thrown out of whack. And Joe Biden and Vice President Harris and their whole team methodically began trying to put the Humpty-Dumpty back together again. And we're doing really well, I think.
I mean, I think you—and because—yes, there was inflation, but there is nothing he could have done about that, unless it was to throw the country into depression.
I mean, when—you start when everything stops. So you've got a shortage of everything and the supply chains are all messed up, there's going to be inflation in the beginning. But he's building all these chip plants around America and doing all these other things.
I noticed we finally got a big electric charging station for—in Queens for all the yellow cabs in New York that are coming and stuff like that.
This stuff is happening, and you're going——
President Biden. And we cut the deficit.
President Clinton. ——to feel it all. It's going to get better and better and better and better and better.
So we should not make 2016's mistake. We should stay with what works and not let people who try to undo it take credit for what happened.
President Obama. And just—because I know we're running out of time, Stephen, but I do want to make this point, because Joe understands this deeply. Bill understood it.
There are structural problems in the economy that can frustrate people—you know, long-term trends in terms of growing inequality because of globalization and technology; you know, the suppression of unions, which Joe has specifically battled against, making sure that working people have the right to collectively bargain.
And so, you know, the frustrations that people feel in a lot of situations—if you're working hard and your paycheck is getting stretched, you know, beyond the breaking point and you're worrying about rent and you're concerned about the price of gas, you know, it's understandable. And one of the things that all three of us accept when you have this extraordinary privilege of serving the American people is, if it's happening on your watch, then even if you didn't have anything to do with it and even if you're making progress, there's going to be frustrations and sometimes those will be directed towards your office. That's part of the deal.
But the thing that not only Joe has to communicate, we who support Joe have to communicate, is, at the end of the day, who do you think is actually going to look out for you? Who do you think is going to fight on your behalf? Who's gone through tough financial times? Who has actually experienced the worry of a child getting sick and you trying to figure out, you know, how you're going to pay for it?
And Joe has gone through those struggles. He's got family members who have experienced that fear and pain and have gotten knocked down and had to get back up.
And, at the end of the day, what you're—what you want, not just out of your President, but out of your Government, is people's whose values are rooted in wanting to make sure everybody gets its shot——
President Biden. Gets a fighting chance.
President Obama. ——that is willing to fight on behalf of people who weren't born into privilege. And that's who Joe Biden is.
And so, you know, when we make an argument about the economy, it's not because we don't recognize that they're real problems and that they're—entire communities that are still feeling like they're being left behind. And it's legitimate for them to feel frustrated. And they're going to occasionally take it out on the President. And that's fair. Because, you know, Joe volunteered for the job—[laughter]—as we all did.
But, at the end of the day, you do have to make a choice. And the question then becomes: Who is it that really sees you and cares about you?
I can—[laughter]—I'm pretty confident the other guy doesn't. This guy does.
President Biden. You know——
President Obama. That's why we're going to have to fight so hard——
President Biden. Thank you. Let me say one thing——
President Obama. ——over the next 8 months.
President Clinton. We do.
President Biden. My dad, who was a very well-read guy. He didn't get to go to college. He got into Johns Hopkins. He was in Baltimore when the war began, and he never got to go.
But my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about your family. It's about having a little bit left over at the end of the month—just a little bit. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Everything is going to be okay,' and mean it.""
What I decided to do is to follow along with these guys have done. I wanted to build a middle class—build the economy from the middle class out and the bottom up.
When that happens, everybody does well. The wealthy do very well. But guess what, guys? Anybody think the tax system is fair? It's about time the wealthy—the very superwealthy start paying their fair share.
I'll give you one example. We have a thousand billionaires in America—a thousand billionaires in America. If we, in fact, just raise their—you know what they pay in taxes? Eight-point-three percent of their income—Federal taxes.
Audience members. Boo!
President Biden. If they just paid 25 percent, we'd raise $400 million—billion dollars over 10 years and be able to wipe out the debt. We'd be able to do so much more. Just paying your fair share.
Mr. Colbert. President Biden——
President Biden. By the way, we cut the deficit—I know you got to wrap up. Cut the—we cut the deficit by the Medicare things we changed. That saved the taxpayer $170 billion a year——$170 billion because they don't have to pay the price—[inaudible]. Anyway, I don't want to get going. [Laughter]
""Wrap up."" I'm wrapping. I'm hushing up.
Mr. Colbert. We have come to the end of our evening. I just want to ask you before we go, sir. A lot of people do impressions of you. Have you seen my impression of you? [Laughter] I'm the first to admit it's not very good. [Laughter] This—the—I put on your glasses. They do a lot of the work. [Laughter]
[At this point, Mr. Colbert put on sunglasses in an impersonation of President Biden.]
Now, we go to do the—and then we got to talk quiet. [Laughter]
President Biden. You know, you're a pretty dull President when you're known for two things: Ray-Ban sunglasses and ice cream.
[President Biden put on sunglasses.]
[Laughter]
Mr. Colbert. Gentlemen, would you care to join us in our—in the impression of President Biden? [Laughter]
[President Clinton and President Obama each put on sunglasses.]
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in thanking President Clinton, President Obama, and President Joseph Biden——
President Biden. By the way, Dark Brandon is real.
Mr. Colbert. Ladies and gentlemen, the Presidents of the United States. Go vote!"""
"Mar 29, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/proclamation-10714-arab-american-heritage-month-2024,"Proclamation 10714—Arab American Heritage Month, 2024","""By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This month, we honor the rich heritage, history, and hopes of the more than 3.5 million Arab Americans across our country who have helped write the American story and move our Nation ever forward embodying the truth that diversity has been and always will be our country's greatest strength.
People with Arab heritage were among the many immigrants who came to our country's shores with a range of cultures, customs, backgrounds, and beliefs, sharing a common courage to start new chapters in an unfamiliar land. As they built their lives, they helped build America—from fighting for our independence in the Continental Army to serving the cause of freedom during World War II to helping build cities and communities across our Nation, often in the face of discrimination and hate.
This legacy of courage, resilience, and service lives on today in Arab Americans across our country. We see it in the brave Arab American service members and public servants, who continue to defend our Nation's security and freedom. We see it in the Arab American engineers, scientists, and medical professionals, who are pioneering new breakthroughs and charting a better future for all. We see it in Arab American business owners and entrepreneurs, who are creating jobs and lifting up communities across the Nation. We see it in Arab American teachers and community leaders, who continue to inspire the next generation. And every day, I see it in the Arab Americans serving throughout my Administration, who are helping us build a stronger, more just Nation.
But as we come together this month to honor these contributions, we must also pause to reflect on the pain being felt by so many in the Arab American community with the war in Gaza. The trauma, death, and destruction in Israel and Gaza have claimed, and continue to claim, far too many innocent lives—including family and friends of Arab Americans across our Nation. I am devastated by the suffering of so many and mourn the lives taken, and I pray for the loved ones left behind and for all the innocent men, women, and children living in dire circumstances.
My Administration is working with partners across the region to respond to the urgent humanitarian crisis, deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza, free the hostages taken during the brutal Hamas terrorist attack on October 7th, and establish an immediate ceasefire that would last at least six weeks, which we would work to build into something more enduring. We are also focused on ensuring that calm is maintained and restored in neighboring states, including Lebanon. We must preserve the space for peace—for a two-state solution with equal measures of security and dignity for both Palestinians and Israelis. We are committed to working with the Arab American community, who remain critical advocates for the Palestinian and Arab people and a just and lasting peace.
This challenge also reminds us of our responsibility as a Nation here at home. Across our country, Arab Americans remain the target of bias and discrimination—including harassment, hate crimes, racist rhetoric, and violent attacks. In recent months, a Palestinian child was killed in his home, a young man was stabbed near a college campus, and a group of students were shot while just walking down the street—tragic reminders that hate never goes away. It only hides. It is up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor.
That is why we are fighting against the rise of all forms of hate, including against Arab Americans. On my first day in office, I rescinded the discriminatory Muslim travel ban that prevented individuals from primarily Middle Eastern and African countries from entering the United States. In 2022, my Administration convened the first United We Stand Summit, which brought together interfaith leaders to counter hate-motivated violence and foster unity. We are also developing our country's first-ever National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination in the United States, which will identify concrete ways to address the scourge of hate against Muslim, Sikh, South Asian, and Arab American communities. To ensure Arab Americans are fully represented, my Administration finalized the addition of a new Middle Eastern and North African option for the 2030 census and other forms that ask for people's race and ethnicity—a vital step to ensure that Arab Americans are seen, counted, and valued as new policy is being made.
America is the only Nation in the world founded on an idea: that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We have never fully lived up to that promise, but we have never walked away from it either. This month, we vow that we never will. Together, we recommit to this promise of America by honoring and advancing the dignity, equity, and security of Arab Americans across our Nation.
Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2024 as Arab American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the history, culture, and achievements of Arab Americans and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.""	Proclamation 10714—Arab American Heritage Month, 2024"
"Apr 02, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-deaths-world-central-kitchen-workers-gaza-palestinian-territories,"Statement on the Deaths of World Central Kitchen Workers in Gaza, Palestinian Territories","""I am outraged and heartbroken by the deaths of seven humanitarian workers from World Central Kitchen, including one American, in Gaza yesterday. They were providing food to hungry civilians in the middle of a war. They were brave and selfless. Their deaths are a tragedy.
Israel has pledged to conduct a thorough investigation into why the aid workers' vehicles were hit by airstrikes. That investigation must be swift, it must bring accountability, and its findings must be made public.
Even more tragically, this is not a stand-alone incident. This conflict has been one of the worst in recent memory in terms of how many aid workers have been killed. This is a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult, because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians. Incidents like yesterday's simply should not happen. Israel has also not done enough to protect civilians. The United States has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations in order to avoid civilian casualties.
The United States will continue to do all we can to deliver humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, through all available means. I will continue to press Israel to do more to facilitate that aid. And we are pushing hard for an immediate cease-fire as part of a hostage deal. I have a team in Cairo working on this right now.
Earlier today I spoke with my friend Chef José Andrés, the founder of World Central Kitchen, to convey my deepest condolences for the deaths of these courageous aid workers and to express my continued support for his and his team's relentless and heroic efforts to get food to hungry people around the globe.
May God bless the humanitarian workers killed yesterday and comfort their families and loved ones in their grief."""
"Apr 03, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-efforts-reduce-health-care-costs,Remarks on Efforts To Reduce Health Care Costs,"""The President. Kris, thank you, thank you, thank you. First of all, thank you for the courage you've shown over the years dealing with your health issues, but also for standing up here before the whole Nation and explaining to us what you've gone through. It's not easy to do.
You know, trying to afford your expensive medications, from blood disorders to asthma—millions of Americans—millions—have similar stories: lying in bed at night literally staring at the ceiling wondering what in God's name will happen if their spouse gets cancer or if their child gets sick or something happens to them. Are they going to have enough insurance? Can they afford the medical bills they're going to have? Will they have to sell the house to keep things moving?
You know, and you find out the big reason why we're lying awake at night with these questions is because the drug companies are charging exorbitant—exorbitant—prescription drug prices, higher prices than anywhere in the world.
When Bernie said it—I was listening in the back. Bernie, you and I have been fighting this for 25 years. Finally—finally we beat Big Pharma. Finally. I'm serious.
I'm proud—[laughter]—I'm proud that my administration is taking on Big Pharma in the most significant ways ever. And I wouldn't have done it without Bernie. And Bernie got a—you know, look, Bernie was the one who was leading the way for decades in which we're—why we're here today.
You know, Bernie mentioned that Americans pay more for prescription drugs than other advanced nation in the world. If you want to—if you walk into a local drugstore here in America, the prices are at least two to three times more for the exact same prescription made by the exact same pharmaceutical company in Canada, France, Italy, and even in Eastern Europe—all around the world. But not anymore.
For years, people have talked about how Medicare has the power to negotiate for lower drug price—prescription drug prices the Government pays for, just like the VA does when they're able to negotiate medicines and needs for the veterans.
But we've tried and tried and tried. And finally, with Bernie's help, I finally got my Inflation Reduction Act, which passed—and Bernie helped get it passed. Not one Republican in the entire Congress—this did surprise me, I have to admit to you—not one single Republican voted for it—not one single one—to give us authority to take on and beat Big Pharma.
Take insulin, for people with diabetes: It costs 10 bucks to make. If you add everything in terms of packaging and all the rest, you can argue maybe $12 total. And they're charging as much as $400 a month. Not anymore. Not anymore. Seniors with diabetes will only have to pay $35 a month from this point on.
And by the way, when I first got the law passed, guess what? It applied to every American—every American. But the Republicans were able to cut back on the fact that only—they only were not able—the only thing they couldn't defeat was seniors. But I want to—I want those savings to be for every single person in America, no matter what their age. No one should pay more than 35 bucks a month for insulin, period.
And by the way, drug companies still make a significant product—I'm—excuse me, significant profit because I said: Ten bucks to make. By the way, the guy who invented the drug didn't want to patent it because he wanted it available to everybody. Well, it's available all right.
But look, folks, there's a whole lot of prescription drugs that are ongoing—undergoing the process of lower pricing. Medicare is now able to negotiate lower prices for some of the costliest drugs that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis. This year alone, the law that's already passed—it's in the law now that we signed—Medicare is negotiating 10 of the most costly drugs next year, and they'll do that every year beyond for the—it goes well beyond 50 drugs.
Next year, it will be 15. It isn't just saving seniors money. Along with other reforms, it's taxpayer money; we're cutting the Federal deficit. And people say, ""Well, it's costing money."" Guess what? It's costing the drug companies money.
It cuts the deficit by $160 billion—$160 billion. [Applause] No, I'm serious. Think about it. Over the next 10 years—because Medicare will no longer have to be—pay those exorbitant prices. Instead of paying 400 bucks, they're paying 35 bucks.
But I think we should be more aggressive. It's time to negotiate lower prices for at least 50 drugs a year. We only have it—the law only requires 10 now, and then 15, and it moves up.
Along with other actions, we're not only saving lives, but if we move that number up, we'll save taxpayers another $200 billion on top of the $160 billion, because Medicare will not be paying these exorbitant costs.
It is a gigantic—and by the way, the other guy talks about cutting the deficit. He increased the deficit more than any President has in history. And we've cut it.
Look, in addition to the law we passed that will cap prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare starting in 2025—it's already the law—doesn't require anything else—because when I say these things, they say, ""You think you can get it done?"" It's already the law.
Every—your drugs will not cost you—if you're a senior on Medicare—will not have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter what the drug costs. And as you know—many of you unfortunately know or your parents—some of the cancer drugs cost $10-, $12-, $15,000 a year. Combined—combined—they will not have to pay a penny beyond $2,000 a year. And the drug companies will still make a lot of money.
Folks, Bernie and I want to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for every American, not just seniors. We're here today to talk about how we're lowering prices and cracking down on unfair competition in prescription drugs.
I'm a capitalist. Capitalism, though, without competition isn't capitalism; it's exploitation. That's what's going on: exploitation. When Big Pharma doesn't play by the rules, competitors can't offer lower prices for generic drugs and devices that carry that medication, so prices are raised artificially. I thank Bernie for leading the charge to do something about this.
For example, asthma is one of the most common respiratory illnesses in America. Twenty-seven million Americans have asthma, including 4 million children. Asthma causes about 1 million visits to a hospital emergency rooms every year. Nationwide, the cost of treating asthma is estimated to be $50 billion a year—the treating the asthma—not the drug, treating the asthma.
If you have asthma, you will likely need an inhaler to breathe. Now this spring is here, the season and allergies are on—upon us. We're on the rise even more. More people with asthma need inhalers to breathe.
You know, many asthma medications—may have—be on the market for more than 25 years. They cost less than $5 to make. They cost less than $5 to make, but the medication hasn't changed at all.
Theoretically, if the drug company came with a new medicine that would—they invested in a lot of money to find a better way, they didn't—they wouldn't have to—they could argue that—another price. But drug companies have increased prices for asthma drugs up to eight times more than the original cost. And the mechanism is—and the mechanisms attached to the inhaler, the thing that makes it, you know, go into your nose or mouth, that is a device that Medicare hasn't changed much either.
Look, these big companies try to keep generic companies away from getting patents on devices that deliver the medication through the inhalers. So there's two pieces. It's not just the—what's in the inhaler. It's the mechanism that allows it to go into your body.
For example, they slightly change the cap of an inhaler, and they use the new patent on that cap to block generic drug companies from being able to enter the market. It's a big deal. Playing these games with patients and pricing, Big Pharma is able to charge Americans significantly higher prices and pad their profits.
Senator Sanders has pointed out one company sells an inhaler for 49 bucks in the United Kingdom. You know how much they charge in the United States for that one inhaler? Six hundred and forty-five dollars. So I take—$645.
If you need that inhaler and you get on Air Force One with me, the next time we go to London, you can get off and you can get it for—[laughter]. No, I'm serious. Think about that, though. Just think about that. For the same exact medicine and the same exact device. It's outrageous.
Another company sells an inhaler for $9 in Germany—$9 in Germany—and we pay $286 here in the United States. Nine bucks in Germany—same outfit, same company, same device—and so it's 30 times more. Thirty times more. I repeat: It's outrageous. And we're doing something about it, finally. Why in God's name should an American pay $645 for the same inhaler sold in the United Kingdom for $49 by the same outfit—the same outfit?
Bernie called out the drug companies during the congressional hearings. And you just heard from Lina Khan, the Federal—the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, who is working with the Food and Drug Administration to crack down on these drug companies, and it's a big deal.
As a result of all this action, some drug companies have withdrawn their abusive patent listings for inhalers and other common products like EpiPens.
You know, the last few weeks, some of the big drug companies have gotten the message to reduce the prices for some asthma drugs. Bernie is a big reason why that's happened. In fact, three of the four largest companies are capping the cost of inhalers for many patients—that can be up to $600 out of pocket—at $35. There's some progress going on beyond what we've done—the law. But it's about time.
And going forward, with more competition and more generic drugs in the market, the price could be even less than it is now and coming down.
But that's not all. Because of all of you, my Inflation Reduction Act—drug companies that raise prices more than inflation are going to pay back Medicare the difference between what they charged and the inflation rate. This is based on the price of their drugs in 2021.
That means consumers will pay less for prescription drugs, and they'll save taxpayers money and discourage companies from hiking prices faster than inflation in the first place. But we want to do more. It's time that drug companies pay rebates when they increase prices faster than inflation, not just for seniors, but for every single American—every single American.
And today's announcement follows actions we've already taken to significantly reduce the health care costs for average Americans. We took action to reduce the cost of hearing aids for millions of Americans by as much as $3,000 for a pair of hearing aids.
In addition, my administration is banning junk fees on health insurance plans. These are the plans that stick consumers with big, unexpected charges instead of covering the care they need.
Look, they ended up with fair surprise—I ended up—surprise medical bills so hospitals that are in-network can't send you a bill for an out-of-network doctor that you didn't choose or you would—haven't even been consulted. I was in the hospital for a while years ago, and that happened.
Kamala and I are protecting and expanding the Affordable Health Care Act, known as Obamacare, which, I might add, is still a big deal. Today—thank God my mother wasn't here—[laughter]—today, 21 million Americans are covered through the Affordable Care Act, 9 million more than when I took office.
I exact tax credits—we enacted tax credits to save an average of $800 per person per year, reducing health care premiums for millions of working families whose coverage—who have coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
These tax credits, though, expire. You can only get it for—through this year. And I'm calling on Congress to make tax credits permanent—permanent—for this process.
And, folks, all of our progress is in stark contrast to my predecessor and MAGA Republicans in the Congress. They want to, quote—I love their word they love—they want to ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act—I love it, ""terminate""—my—as my predecessor says, kicking millions of Americans off their health insurance.
And by the way, the vast majority of these people would not be able to get insurance because they have a preexisting condition.
They also want to eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act, eliminate the savings to lower prescription drug prices, and so much more.
During the last administration, my President—my predecessor exploded the national debt more than any previous President in the history in a 4-year term—more than any previous—he talks about the debt. He exploded it more than any other President in a 4-year term with his $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly—overwhelmingly—benefited the very wealthy and the biggest corporations in America.
Now he and his Republicans in Congress want to cut Social Security—raise the age—and cut Medicare while they cut taxes for the very wealthy again. You know, I've got a better idea. I'm going to protect Social Security and Medicare, along with Bernie and other Members of Congress, to make sure the wealthy begin to pay their fair share to keep these programs solvent. It's not hard.
And let me repeat what I said that even some people, like Bernie, didn't like at the beginning—and I don't blame them—but I said on day one, to make a point: No one in America will pay a single penny more in Federal taxes if they make under—less than—if they make less than $400,000 a year.
I wish I was able to do that. I was listed—and Bernie will—used to kid me about it—I was listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years. I didn't think I was poor. I got a good salary. But I was the poorest man in Congress.
Trump brags about, he is the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned. And here's his quote: ""I did something no one thought possible. I got rid of Roe v. Wade."" End of quote. And now he and his MAGA officials are calling on a—for a national ban on the right to choose in every State.
I promise you: With a Democratic Congress, Kamala and I will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. I promise you.
I'm talking too long here. Let me close with this. [Laughter] But I'm excited about this. I'm really proud of what we've been able to do. I really am.
Bernie and I have been doing this work for a long time. I know we don't look it, but we've been doing it a long time. [Laughter] Bernie and I have something else in common: We both married way above our stations.
But any rate—[laughter]—but we know we've made historic progress in the last 3 years: 35 bucks for insulin for seniors, $35 for inhalers for asthma, $2,000 a year total cap on costs for seniors. We're lowering the cost of some of the most expensive prescription drugs for seniors. And what I want to do next—what we want to do next is these caps on costs for everyone—everyone, not just seniors.
With Bernie's help, we're showing how health care ought to be a right and not a privilege in America. And that's why I've never been more optimistic about—I really mean it. You've heard me say in this very room how optimistic I am. I am optimistic because the laws we got passed are now coming into effect, whether it's the infrastructure or whether it's this. I mean, there's so much more.
I just have—we have to—and I said this many times and I'll get out of your hair. You know, we have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America.
I mean—these things from the bottom of my heart. We're the United—there is nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. We're the only Nation—as a student of history—that I can find that's come out of every crisis we've entered stronger than we went in every single time. So let's remember who the hell—we're the United States of America.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you all.

Well, Fumio, welcome back to the White House. Welcome back to the Oval Office. It's good to have you here and good to see you again.
When we were here last year, we said the role being played by the United States and Japan is becoming even greater. And we—I couldn't agree more with your assertion back then.
And what we see in our joint support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's vicious assault was—it's just outrageous.
We see it in our historic trilateral relationship with South Korea. We see it in our economic investments, which has helped generate millions of jobs across both our nations.
And I sincerely want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for your bold leadership across all these issues. You, personally, have made all this possible. And I would assert our alliance has never been stronger in our entire history.
So today I look forward to discussing how we can even deepen it more, including increasing defense and in technology and cooperation across the board.
And we can also discuss how we can continue to enhance and ensure Indo-Pacific remains a free, open, and prosperous region of the world with us standing together.
And thank you for being here, Mr. Prime Minister. You've heard me say this before, but I'll say it again: You're a genuine leader, a true partner, and a good friend.
Thank you for being here.
Prime Minister Kishida. Well, Joe, thank you so much for those very kind words of welcome. And I'm very grateful to be invited to the United States for this official visit. My wife Yuko and I are sincerely grateful for the warm hospitality extended by you and Dr. Biden.
Up until now, Joe, you and I, we have had countless dialogues, and we have nurtured a friendship and a trust along the way. Japan and the United States are now at the forefront in maintaining and strengthening a free and open international order, based on the rule of law.
Japan and the United States are also indispensable now to each other in driving sustainable and inclusive economic growth as well.
Through this official visit, I look forward to confirming the robust bond between our two nations and show—demonstrate at home and abroad how Japan and the U.S., firmly bound together, will build a future as global partners.

"Apr 10, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-japan-global-partners-for,Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan—Global Partners for the Future,"""Over the course of the last three years, the U.S.-Japan Alliance has reached unprecedented heights. We arrived at this historic moment because our nations, individually and together, took courageous steps to strengthen our collective capacity in ways that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. Today, we, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Prime Minister KISHIDA Fumio, celebrate this new era of U.S.-Japan strategic cooperation during the Prime Minister's Official Visit and State Dinner in Washington, D.C.—and pledge that the United States and Japan will continue our tireless work, together and with other partners, to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific and world.
In this new era of U.S.-Japan cooperation, we recognize that global events affect the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific, and that developments in our shared region reverberate around the world. We are therefore working together, across all domains and at all levels, to build a global partnership that is fit for purpose to address the complex, interconnected challenges of today and tomorrow for the benefit of our two countries and the world. As our Alliance cooperation reaches new heights, we are expanding our engagement to reflect the global nature of our partnership.
At the core of our cooperation is a shared commitment to work with like-minded partners and multilateral institutions to address common challenges and to ensure a world that is free, open, connected, resilient, and secure. These joint efforts are based on our shared fundamental respect for international law, including the protection and promotion of human rights and dignity, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, and the prohibition on acquisition of territory by force. Our purpose as partners is to uphold and bolster the free and open international order based on the rule of law that has allowed so many nations to develop and prosper, and to ensure our Alliance is equipped to tackle the challenges of the 21st century.
To advance our global partnership, today we announce several new strategic initiatives to strengthen our defense and security cooperation; reach new frontiers in space; drive technology innovation; bolster economic security; accelerate climate action; partner on global diplomacy and development; and fortify the ties between our peoples. Through our global partnership, we are also synchronizing our strategies, and our two nations have never been more united as we work together to address the most pressing challenges and opportunities of the future.
Strengthening our Defense and Security Cooperation 
The core of our global partnership is our bilateral defense and security cooperation under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, which is stronger than ever. We affirm that our Alliance remains the cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. President Biden reiterated the unwavering commitment of the United States to the defense of Japan under Article V of the Treaty, using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. Prime Minister Kishida reaffirmed Japan's unwavering commitment to fundamentally reinforce its own defense capabilities and roles, and to enhance its close coordination with the United States under the Treaty. President Biden also reaffirmed that Article V applies to the Senkaku Islands. We reiterated our strong opposition to any attempts by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea, including through actions that seek to undermine Japan's longstanding and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands. We welcome the progress in optimizing Alliance force posture in areas including the Southwestern Islands to strengthen U.S.-Japan deterrence and response capabilities, and we confirm the importance of further advancing this initiative.
The United States welcomes the steps Japan is taking to fundamentally enhance its defense capabilities, including its plans to increase the budget for its defense capabilities and complementary initiatives to two percent of GDP in Japanese Fiscal Year (JFY) 2027 in accordance with Japan's National Security Strategy, its decision to possess counterstrike capabilities, and its plans to stand up the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) Joint Operations Command to enhance command and control of the JSDF. Together, these initiatives elevate our defense ties to unprecedented levels and launch a new era of U.S.-Japan security cooperation, strengthening our Alliance and contributing to stability in the Indo-Pacific.
Today, we announce several new strategic initiatives to further advance our Alliance. Recognizing the speed at which regional security challenges evolve and to ensure our bilateral Alliance structures meet these critical changes, we announce our intention to bilaterally upgrade our respective command and control frameworks to enable seamless integration of operations and capabilities and allow for greater interoperability and planning between U.S. and Japanese forces in peacetime and during contingencies. More effective U.S.-Japan Alliance command and control will strengthen deterrence and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of pressing regional security challenges. We call on our respective defense and foreign ministries to develop this new relationship through the Security Consultative Committee (our security ""2+2""). In support of this vision, we also reaffirm our goal to deepen Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance cooperation and Alliance information sharing capabilities, including through the Bilateral Information Analysis Cell.
We will also continue to implement efforts to strengthen our Alliance force posture, build high-end base capabilities, and increase preparedness that are necessary to deter and defend against threats. We resolve to deepen bilateral cooperation toward the effective development and employment of Japan's suite of counterstrike capabilities, including the provision of U.S. materiel and technological support to enhance Japan's indigenous stand-off programs. The United States expressed its commitment to start the training pipeline and ship modifications for Japan to acquire operational capability of the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) system. We also reaffirmed our pursuit of a Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) cooperative development program to counter high-end, regional hypersonic threats.
As our countries strengthen our bilateral ties, we will continue to build our relationships with like-minded partners in the region. Today, we announce our vision to cooperate on a networked air defense architecture among the United States, Japan, and Australia to counter growing air and missile threats. Recognizing Japan's strengths and the close bilateral defense partnerships with the AUKUS countries, AUKUS partners—Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—are considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects. Continuing the momentum from the Camp David Summit, we welcome progress on establishing an annual multidomain exercise between the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ROK). Recognizing the commitments made in the Atlantic Declaration and the Hiroshima Accord, and as the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions become ever more interlinked, we welcome the announcement of regular U.S.-Japan-UK trilateral exercises, beginning in 2025, as we enhance our shared and enduring security. Building on the announcement at the Australia Official Visit in October to pursue trilateral cooperation with Japan on unmanned aerial systems, we are exploring cooperative opportunities in the rapidly emerging field of collaborative combat aircraft and autonomy.
The United States welcomes Japan's revision of the Three Principles on the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and its Implementation Guidelines, which bolsters cooperation through joint development and production to enhance our deterrence capabilities in the region. To leverage our respective industrial bases to meet the demand for critical capabilities and maintain readiness over the long term, we will convene a Forum on Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition and Sustainment (DICAS) co-led by the U.S. Department of Defense and Japan's Ministry of Defense to identify priority areas for partnering U.S. and Japanese industry, including co-development and co-production of missiles and co-sustainment of forward-deployed U.S. Navy ships and U.S. Air Force aircraft, including fourth generation fighters, at Japanese commercial facilities, in coordination with relevant ministries. This forum, in conjunction with our existing Defense Science and Technology Cooperation Group, will better integrate and align our defense industrial policy, acquisition, and science and technology ecosystems. The DICAS will provide updates on progress to the foreign and defense ministers in the security ""2+2."" We also commit to establishing a working group to explore opportunities for future fighter pilot training and readiness, including AI and advanced simulators, and co-development and co-production of cutting-edge technologies such as common jet trainers to maintain combat-ready next-generation fighter airpower.
We reaffirm the critical importance of continuing to enhance U.S. extended deterrence, bolstered by Japan's defense capabilities, and will further strengthen bilateral cooperation. In this regard, we call on our respective foreign and defense ministers to hold in-depth discussions on extended deterrence on the occasion of the next security ""2+2"" meeting.
We continue to deepen our cooperation on information and cyber security to ensure that our Alliance stays ahead of growing cyber threats and builds resilience in the information and communication technology domain. We also plan on enhancing our cooperation on the protection of critical infrastructure.
Recognizing the importance of rapidly responding to frequent and severe climate change-related and other natural disasters, we plan to explore cooperation on the establishment of a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief hub in Japan.
In order to maintain deterrence and mitigate impact on local communities, we are firmly committed to the steady implementation of the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan in accordance with Okinawa Consolidation Plan, including the construction of the Futenma Replacement Facility at Henoko as the only solution that avoids the continued use of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.
Reaching New Frontiers in Space 
Our global partnership extends to space, where the United States and Japan are leading the way to explore our solar system and return to the Moon. Today, we welcome the signing of a Lunar Surface Exploration Implementing Arrangement, in which Japan plans to provide and sustain operation of a pressurized lunar rover while the United States plans to allocate two astronaut flight opportunities to the lunar surface for Japan on future Artemis missions. The leaders announced a shared goal for a Japanese national to be the first non-American astronaut to land on the Moon on a future Artemis mission, assuming important benchmarks are achieved. The United States and Japan plan to deepen cooperation on astronaut training to facilitate this goal while managing the risks of these challenging and inspiring lunar surface missions. We also announce bilateral collaboration on a Low Earth Orbit detection and tracking constellation for missiles such as hypersonic glide vehicles, including potential collaboration with U.S. industry.
Leading on Innovation, Economic Security, and Climate Action 
The United States and Japan aim to maximally align our economic, technology, and related strategies to advance innovation, strengthen our industrial bases, promote resilient and reliable supply chains, and build the strategic emerging industries of the future while pursuing deep emissions reductions this decade. Building on our efforts in the U.S.-Japan Competitiveness and Resilience (CoRe) Partnership, including through the U.S.-Japan Economic Policy Consultative Committee (our economic ""2+2""), we intend to sharpen our innovative edge and strengthen our economic security, including by promoting and protecting critical and emerging technologies.
The United States and Japan welcome our robust economic and commercial ties through mutual investment, including Microsoft's $2.9 billion investment in Japan on AI and cloud infrastructure, workforce training, and a research lab; and Toyota's recent additional $8 billion battery production investment for a cumulative $13.9 billion investment in North Carolina. Japan is the top foreign investor in the United States with nearly $800 billion in foreign direct investment, and Japanese companies employ nearly 1 million Americans across all 50 states. Similarly, as a top foreign investor in Japan for many years, the United States is supporting Japan's economic growth, and as two of the world's largest financial sectors, we commit to strengthening our partnership to bolster cross-border investment and support financial stability. As robust and creative economies, we also plan to accelerate investment in our respective start-up environments to foster innovation through the ""Japan Innovation Campus"" in Silicon Valley and the ""Global Startup Campus"" to be established in Tokyo, and in companies that take actions toward sustainable value creation (SX). We welcome our new Japan-U.S. personnel exchange programs on startups and venture capital firms under the Global Innovation through Science and Technology (GIST) initiative.
We are committed to strengthening our shared role as global leaders in the development and protection of next-generation critical and emerging technologies such as AI, quantum technology, semiconductors, and biotechnology through research exchange and private investment and capital finance, including with other like-minded partners. We welcome our collaboration on AI for Science between Riken and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) founded on the revised project arrangement.
We applaud the establishment of $110 million in new AI research partnerships—between the University of Washington and University of Tsukuba and between Carnegie Mellon University and Keio University—through funding from NVIDIA, Arm, Amazon, Microsoft, and a consortium of Japanese companies. We are committed to further advancing the Hiroshima AI Process and strengthening collaboration between the national AI Safety Institutes.
Building on our long history of semiconductor cooperation, we intend to establish a joint technology agenda for cooperation on issues such as research and development, design, and workforce development. We also welcome the robust cooperation between and with our private sectors, especially in next-generation semiconductors and advanced packaging. We also plan to work together along with like-minded countries to strengthen global semiconductor supply chains, particularly for mature node (""legacy"") semiconductors through information-sharing, coordination of policies, and addressing vulnerabilities stemming from non-market policies and practices. We also celebrate the signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation between Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a first step in bilateral cooperation on quantum computing.
Building on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and our respective leadership of the G7 and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) last year, we continue to advance resilience, sustainability, inclusiveness, economic growth, fairness, and competitiveness for our economies. We applaud the recent entry into force of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement. We will continue to seek cooperation on critical minerals projects, including those along the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment Lobito Corridor, and through the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) as well as the Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE). We are cooperating to deter and address economic coercion, through our bilateral cooperation as well as through our work with like-minded partners including the G7 Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion. We are working to uphold a free, fair and rules-based economic order; address non-market policies and practices; build trusted, resilient, and sustainable supply chains; and promote open markets and fair competition under the U.S.-Japan economic ""2+2"" and the U.S.-Japan Commercial and Industrial Partnership. We will advance our commitment to operationalize data free flow with trust, including with respect to data security. We will also discuss the promotion of resilient and responsible seafood supply chains.
The United States and Japan recognize that the climate crisis is the existential challenge of our time and intend to be leaders in the global response. Towards our shared goal of accelerating the clean energy transition, we are launching a new high-level dialogue on how we implement our respective domestic measures and maximize their synergies and impacts, including the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and Japan's Green Transformation (GX) Promotion Strategy aimed at accelerating energy transition progress this decade, promoting complementary and innovative clean energy supply chains and improving industrial competitiveness. Today we announce Japan joins as the first international collaborator of the U.S. Floating Offshore Wind Shot. We intend to work together towards global ambition in line with the Wind Shot, taking into consideration national circumstances, through the Clean Energy and Energy Security Initiative (CEESI) to pursue innovative breakthroughs that drive down technology costs, accelerate decarbonization, and deliver benefits for coastal communities. The United States welcomes Japan's newly-launched industry platform, the Floating Offshore Wind Technology Research Association (FLOWRA), aiming to reduce costs and achieve mass production of floating offshore wind through collaboration with academia.
We are further leading the way in developing and deploying next generation clean energy technology, including fusion energy development through the announcement of a U.S.-Japan Strategic Partnership to Accelerate Fusion Energy Demonstration and Commercialization.
The United States remains unwavering in its commitment to support the energy security of Japan and other allies, including its ability to predictably supply LNG while accelerating the global transition to zero-emissions energy and working with other fossil energy importers and producers to minimize methane emissions across the fossil energy value chain to the fullest extent practicable.
We intend to advance widespread adoption of innovative new clean energy technologies, and seek to increase the globally available supply of sustainable aviation fuel or feedstock, including those that are ethanol-based, that show promise in reducing emissions.
We are also working to align global health security and innovation, including in such areas as pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response and promoting more resilient, equitable, and sustainable health systems. Today, we announce that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) intend to collaborate and exchange information on oncology drug products to help cancer patients receive earlier access to medications and to discuss future drug development and ways to prevent drug shortages. We welcome PMDA's future representative office in Washington, D.C., to facilitate this cooperation.
Partnering on Global Diplomacy and Development 
The challenges we face transcend geography. The United States and Japan are steadfast in our commitment to upholding international law, including the UN Charter, and call for all Member States to uphold the Charter's purposes and principles, including refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State. We remain committed to reforming the UN Security Council (UNSC), including through expansion in permanent and non-permanent categories of its membership. President Biden reiterated support for Japan's permanent membership on a reformed UNSC.
We reaffirm our commitment made in Hiroshima last year and are determined to further promote our cooperation in the G7 and work together with partners beyond the G7.
We emphasize the importance of all parties promoting open channels of communication and practical measures to reduce the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation and to prevent conflict in the Indo-Pacific. In particular, we underscore the importance of candid communication with the PRC, including at the leader level, and express the intent to work with the PRC where possible on areas of common interest.
We emphasize the importance of all States being able to exercise rights and freedoms in a manner consistent with international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), including freedom of navigation and overflight. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion, including destabilizing actions in the South China Sea, such as unsafe encounters at sea and in the air as well as the militarization of disputed features and the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia. The PRC's recent dangerous and escalatory behavior supporting its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea as well as efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation are inconsistent with international law as reflected in UNCLOS. We also emphasize that the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award is final and legally binding on the parties to that proceeding. We resolve to work with partners, particularly in ASEAN, to support regional maritime security and uphold international law.
We emphasize that our basic positions on Taiwan remain unchanged and reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity. We encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.
We continue working together with partner countries to make concrete progress in strengthening the international financial architecture and fostering investment under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We are committed to delivering better, bigger, more effective multilateral development banks including through our planned contributions that would enable more than $30 billion in new World Bank lending and securing ambitious International Development Association and Asian Development Fund replenishments. We also emphasize the importance of private sector investment in the Indo-Pacific. We welcome the announcement of Google's $1 billion investment in digital connectivity for North Pacific Connect, which expands the Pacific Connect Initiative, with NEC, to improve digital communications infrastructure between the United States, Japan and Pacific Island Nations. Building on the U.S.-Australia joint funding commitment for subsea cables last October, the United States and Japan plan to collaborate with like-minded partners to build trusted and more resilient networks and intend to contribute funds to provide subsea cables in the Pacific region, including $16 million towards cable systems for the Federated States of Micronesia and Tuvalu.
We reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the Quad and its shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific that is stable, prosperous, and inclusive which continues to deliver results for the region. We reiterate the Quad's unwavering support and respect for regional institutions, including ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and the Indian Ocean Rim Association. We also reaffirm our support for ASEAN centrality and unity as well as the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. Southeast Asian countries are critical partners in the Indo-Pacific and the U.S.-Japan-Philippines trilateral aims to enhance trilateral defense and security cooperation while promoting economic security and resilience. Japan and the United States reaffirmed our intention to work to support the region's priorities as articulated through the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, including through the PIF as the Pacific's preeminent institution as well as through the Partners in the Blue Pacific (PBP).
As we pursue our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, we continue to build strong ties between key, like-minded partners in the region. Building on the historic success of the Camp David Trilateral Summit, the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea continue to collaborate on promoting regional security, strengthening deterrence, coordinating development and humanitarian assistance, countering North Korea's illicit cyber activities, and deepening our cooperation including on economic, clean energy, and technological issues. The United States and Japan also remain committed to advancing trilateral cooperation with Australia to ensure a peaceful and stable region.
We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of North Korea in accordance with relevant UNSC resolutions. We strongly condemn North Korea's continued development of its ballistic missile program—including through launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and space launch vehicles using ballistic missile technologies—which poses a grave threat to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. We call on North Korea to respond to continued, genuine offers to return to diplomacy without preconditions. We call on all UN Member States to fully implement all relevant UNSC resolutions, especially in light of Russia's recent veto. We urge North Korea to cease illicit activities that generate revenue for its unlawful ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs, including malicious cyber activities. President Biden also reaffirms U.S. commitment to the immediate resolution of the abductions issue, and the two sides commit to continuing joint efforts to promote respect for human rights in North Korea.
We continue to stand together in firm opposition to Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine, its strikes against Ukraine's infrastructure and the terror of Russian occupation. We are committed to continuing to impose severe sanctions on Russia and provide unwavering support for Ukraine. Together, we reiterate our call on Russia to immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw its forces from within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. Any threat or use of nuclear weapons in the context of its war of aggression against Ukraine by Russia is unacceptable. We also express serious concerns about growing North Korea-Russia military cooperation, which is supporting Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and threatens to undermine peace and stability in Northeast Asia as well as the global non-proliferation regime.
As the linkages between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific regions have become stronger than ever, our two countries look forward to continuing to work together to enhance Japan-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and NATO-Indo-Pacific Four partnerships.
We once again unequivocally condemn the terror attacks by Hamas and others on October 7 of last year, and reaffirm Israel's right to defend itself and its people consistent with international law. At the same time, we express our deep concern over the critical humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. We affirm the imperative of securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and emphasize that the deal to release hostages would bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza. We affirm the imperative of realizing an immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza over a period of at least six weeks as part of a deal that would release hostages held by Hamas and allow for delivery of essential additional humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in need. We underscore the urgent need to significantly increase deliveries of life-saving humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza and the crucial need to prevent regional escalation. We reiterate the importance of complying with international law, including international humanitarian law, as applicable, including with regard to the protection of civilians. We remain committed to an independent Palestinian state with Israel's security guaranteed as part of a two-state solution that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting, and secure peace.
We reaffirm the importance of supporting inclusive growth and sustainable development in Latin America and the Caribbean. We continue to enhance policy coordination in the region, in particular on Haiti and Venezuela. We also recognize that promoting the stability and security for Haiti is one of the most pressing challenges in the Western Hemisphere, and we continue to support Haiti in restoring democratic order.
We also support African aspirations for peace, stability, and prosperity based on the rule of law. We continue to work together to support the democratic process and economic growth through our respective efforts, including our cooperation with African countries, Regional Economic Communities, the African Union, and multilateral organizations.
The United States and Japan are resolved to achieve a world without nuclear weapons through realistic and pragmatic approaches. It is critical that the overall decline in global nuclear arsenals achieved since the end of the Cold War continues and not be reversed, and the PRC's accelerating build-up of its nuclear arsenal without transparency nor meaningful dialogue poses a concern to global and regional stability. We reaffirm the importance of upholding the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as the cornerstone of the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and for the pursuit of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In promoting this universal goal of achieving a world without nuclear weapons, Japan's ""Hiroshima Action Plan"" and the ""G7 Leaders' Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament"" are welcome contributions. The two leaders also welcomed the U.S. announcement to join the Japan-led ""Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty Friends"" initiative. We reaffirm the indispensable role of the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, committing to fostering innovation and supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency's efforts in upholding the highest standards of safety, security, and safeguards. President Biden commended Japan's safe, responsible, and science-based discharge of Advanced Liquid Processing System treated water at Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the sea. Our two countries plan to launch the Fukushima Daiichi Decommissioning Partnership focusing on research cooperation for fuel debris retrieval.
To effectively address the myriad challenges outlined above, our global partnership is launching a Deputy Secretary of State/Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs-level dialogue involving our respective aid agencies to align our diplomatic and development efforts globally.
Fortifying People-to-People Ties 
People-to-people exchanges are the most effective way to develop the future stewards of the U.S.-Japan relationship. In this regard, we recognize the achievements of exchange programs between our two countries, including the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme, KAKEHASHI Project, the Japan Foundation's programs, and the U.S.-Japan Council's TOMODACHI Initiative, and commit ourselves to providing more opportunities to meet today's needs, including through enhanced subnational exchanges on critical issues such as climate and energy. We also recognize the important role civil society has played in strengthening the U.S.-Japan relationship over the past 170 years, including the 38 Japan-America Societies across the United States, the Asia Society, and the 29 America-Japan Societies across Japan.
Building on the Memorandum of Cooperation in Education signed between us on the sidelines of the G7 Leaders' Summit in Hiroshima, today we announce our commitment to increase student mobility through the new $12 million ""Mineta Ambassadors Program (MAP)"" education exchange endowment administered by the U.S.-Japan Council for U.S. and Japanese high school and university students who will ""map"" the future of the relationship with support from Apple, the BlackRock Foundation, Toshizo Watanabe Foundation, and other founding donors. In this regard, we also welcome Japan's new initiative to expand scholarship for Japanese students through the Japan Student Servicers Organization.
We recognize the significant contributions made by the binational Japan-U.S. Educational Commission (Fulbright Japan) over the past 72 years. We welcome recent changes to upgrade the program by reopening scholarships to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields for the first time in 50 years, with the first STEM students on track to participate in academic year 2025-26, as well as removing the tuition cap for Japanese Fulbright participants to attract the highest quality students and researchers.
Celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Mansfield Fellowship Program, we honor the legacy of Ambassador Mansfield's contributions through the University of Montana Mansfield Center and Mansfield Foundation. The two leaders also welcome the creation of the Government of Japan endowed Mansfield Professor of Japanese and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana.
Upon the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Senator Daniel K. Inouye, who made incredible contributions to our bilateral relationship, we praise the efforts of Japanese American leaders to build a bridge between the two countries and to address common community issues, including through support to the U.S.-Japan Council's newly launched TOMODACHI Kibou for Maui project. We also share the recognition on the importance of exchanges between our legislatures. We acknowledge the importance of language study, particularly in person, to develop long-term ties and announce a new Memorandum of Cooperation to increase opportunities for the number of exchange visitors from Japan to share their specialized knowledge of Japanese language and culture in the United States, as well as welcome efforts to expand the Japanese Language Education Assistant Program (J-LEAP).
The two leaders also affirm that women in leadership remain their focus and reaffirm our pledge to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all their diversity. We welcome close cooperation on Women, Peace, and Security and Women's Economic Empowerment initiatives and efforts to promote women and girls' full, equal, and meaningful participation and leadership in public life.
Finally, we emphasize the need to build a diverse pipeline of future U.S.-Japan experts who understand and support the Alliance. Our peoples form the core of our Alliance, and we reaffirm our commitment to forge ever-closer bonds for generations to come.
Through our shared and steadfast commitment, we have taken bold and courageous steps to bring the U.S.-Japan Alliance to unprecedented heights. In so doing, we have equipped our partnership to protect and advance peace, security, prosperity, and the rule of law across the Indo-Pacific and the globe so that everyone benefits. Today, we celebrate the enduring friendship among our peoples—and among ourselves—and pledge to continue our relentless efforts to ensure that our global partnership drives future peace and prosperity for generations to come.""	Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan—Global Partners for the Future"
"Apr 10, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-japan,The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan,"""President Biden. Please, have a seat.
It's an honor to stand here today with the Prime Minister of Japan, President Kishida—Prime Minister Kishida.
When I became President, I said that the United States would rebuild the muscle of our democratic alliances and we'd stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies again, because our alliances are America's greatest asset. The relationship with Japan is powerful proof of that—that in investing in our alliance and raising our collective ambitions, we yield remarkable results.
Over the last 3 years, the partnership between Japan and the United States has been transformed into a truly global partnership. And that's thanks in no small part to the courageous leadership of Prime Minister Kishida. And I mean that sincerely.
Together, our countries are taking significant steps to strengthen defense and security cooperation, we're modernizing command and control structures, and we're increasing the interoperability and planning of our militaries so they can work together in a seamless and effective way. This is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since the end of—since it was first established.
I'm also pleased to announce that for the first time, Japan and the United States and Australia will create a networked system of air, missile, and defense architecture. We're also looking forward to standing up a trilateral military exercise with Japan and the United Kingdom.
And our AUKUS defense partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom is exploring how Japan can join our work in the second pillar, which focuses on advanced capabilities, including AI, autonomous systems. All told, that represents a new benchmark for our military cooperation across a range of capabilities.
On the economic front, our ties have never been more robust. Japan is the top foreign investor in the United States. Say that again: Japan is the top foreign investor in the United States. And we, the United States, are the top foreign investor in Japan. Nearly 1 million Americans work in Japanese companies here in the United States.
And to name just one example, a few months ago, Toyota announced an $8 billion investment in a massive battery production facility in North Carolina, which will employ thousands of people. The Prime Minister is going to travel to North Carolina tomorrow to visit that project.
Don't stay. Don't stay. We need you back in Japan. [Laughter] They'll probably try to keep you.
We also affirmed the science and education ties between Japan and the United States. Those tries—ties stretch up to the Moon, where two Japanese astronauts will join future American missions, and one will become the first non-American ever to land on the Moon.
And they reach into the high schools and universities, as well, where the Mineta Ambassador—Minetas Program exists, named for our dear friend Norm Mineta. We're going to invest in new student exchanges, help train the next generation of Japanese and American leaders.
We also discussed developments in the Middle East, including our shared support for a cease-fire and a hostage deal and urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian crisis that exists in Gaza.
We also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a—they—they're threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel. As I told Prime Minister Netanyahu, our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad. Let me say it again: ironclad. We're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security.
And finally, I want to commend the Prime Minister himself. He is a statesman. Command—you know, the fact is that you condemned Putin's invasion of—brutal invasion of Ukraine when it happened. You pledged more than $12 billion in aid; prioritizing nuclear nonproliferation at the United Nations Security Council; standing strong with the United States as we stand up for freedom of navigation, including in the South China Sea, and as we maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits; and taking the brave step of mending ties with the Republic of Korea so we can all stand shoulder to shoulder together.
Tomorrow we will both be joined by another good friend, President Marcos of the Philippines, for a trilateral summit, the first of its kind.
And through it all, our commitment to the defense of Japan under article 5, including the —excuse me—Senkaku Islands, is unwavering.
Mr. Prime Minister, through our partnership, we have strengthened the alliance. We have expanded our work together. We have raised our shared ambitions. And now, the U.S.-Japan alliance is a beacon to the entire world. There's no limit to what our countries can and our people can do together.
So thank you for your partnership, your leadership, and your friendship.
And now, over to you, Mr. Prime Minister.
[At this point, Prime Minister Kishida spoke briefly in Japanese; no transcript was provided. He then addressed President Biden in English as follows.]
Prime Minister Kishida. Thank you, Joe.
[Prime Minister Kishida continued in Japanese, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Prime Minister Kishida. President Biden and I have met and talked countless times and confirmed our shared notion that we are at crucial crossroads and that Japan-U.S. partnership is immensely important.
The international community stands at a historical turning point. In order for Japan, the U.S., the Indo-Pacific region, and, for that matter, the whole world to enjoy peace, stability, and prosperity lasting into the future, we must resolutely defend and further solidify a free and open international order based on the rule of law.
And again, today I told the President that now is the time to demonstrate the true values that Japan and the United States can offer as global partners, that we must together fulfill our responsibilities to create a world where human dignity is upheld and that Japan will always stand firm with the United States.
I explained that, based on our national security strategy, Japan is determined to strengthen our defense force through position of counterstrike capabilities, increase our defense budget and other initiatives, and was reassured by President Biden of his strong support for such efforts.
In such context, we confirmed again the urgency to further bolster the deterrence and response capabilities of our alliance and concurred on reinforcing our security and defense cooperation to increase interoperability between the U.S. forces and our self-defense forces, including the improvement of our respective command-and-control frameworks.
We will be discussing the specifics as we plan for the next Japan-U.S. two-plus-two.
The President and I went on to discuss various specific challenges faced by the international community.
First, we confirmed that unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion is absolutely unacceptable, wherever it may be, and that we will continue to respond resolutely against such action through cooperation with allies and like-minded nations.
From such perspective, we agreed that our two countries will continue to respond to challenges concerning China through close coordination. At the same time, we confirmed the importance of continuing our dialogue with China and cooperating with China on common challenges.
We also underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits and confirmed our position to encourage peaceful resolution of the cross-Straits issue.
The situation in North Korea, including nuclear and missiles development, was brought up as well. We welcomed the progress seen in many areas of cooperation based on the outcome of the Japan-U.S.-R.O.K. summit last August and concurred to coordinate even more closely as we face serious concerns under the current state of affairs. President Biden once again demonstrated his strong support towards the immediate resolution of the abduction issue.
We reaffirmed the importance of realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific based on the rule of law and concurred to maintain close collaboration through various opportunities, including the Japan-U.S.-Philippines summit, which is planned for tomorrow.
Regarding Russia's aggression of Ukraine, based on a recognition that Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow—taking the issue as our own problem for Japan, I expressed our resolution to continue with stringent sanctions against Russia and strong support for Ukraine. And we concurred to maintain close partnership with like-minded countries.
On the situation in the Middle East, I expressed my respect for the efforts of President Biden towards the release of the hostages, improvement of the humanitarian situation, and for calming down the situation. I then explained how Japan is continuing diplomatic efforts to improve the humanitarian situation and to realize a sustainable cease-fire and agreed to continue close cooperation towards the improvement of the situation, the realization of a two-state solution, and the stabilization of the region.
Regarding the economy, we firstly concurred that for both of us to lead the global economic growth together, the promotion of investment in both directions is important. I explained how Japanese businesses are making a significant contribution to the U.S. economy by their investment and the creation of jobs, to which President Biden agreed.
In order to maintain and strengthen the competitive edge in the area of advanced technologies and to respond appropriately to issues such as economic coercion, nonmarket policies and practices, and excess capacities and to overcome the vulnerability of the supply chains and to lead a sustainable and inclusive economic growth, we affirmed that the collaboration of Japan and the United States is indispensable.
In addition, we concurred to advance our cooperation in the areas such as decarbonization, AI, and start-ups.
There was a huge achievement also in the area of space. In the first half of the 1960s, when I was in the United States, it was the dawn of space development in the United States. I am one of all those who were so excited in the U.S. by the spectacular challenge in space.
The implementing arrangement has been signed on this occasion and the provision of the lunar rover by Japan and the allocation of two astronaut flight opportunities to the lunar surface to Japan were confirmed. Under the Artemis program, I welcome the lunar landing by a Japanese astronaut as the first non-U.S. astronaut.
We also discussed the efforts towards a world without nuclear weapons. We affirmed the realistic and practical endeavors of nuclear disarmament, including the issuance of the G-7 Leaders' Hiroshima Vision last year. And I welcomed the participation of the United States in the FMCT Friends, which was launched by my initiative.
Lastly, in order to further strengthen the people-to-people bond, which is the cornerstone of our unwavering Japan-U.S. relationship, we affirmed to further promote people-to-people exchanges.
As the outcome of our meeting today, we will issue the joint statement titled ""The Global Partners for the Future."" This is the expression of the determination of Japan and the United States to maintain and strengthen a free and open international order based on the rule of law that underpins the peace, stability, and prosperity of the international community and states the guiding principles.
With our partnership, we will defend the future of Japan and the United States, the Indo-Pacific, and the world and make that future all the more prosperous.
President Biden. Thank you. Now we'll take a few questions.
Jordan Fabian of Bloomberg.
Federal Reserve/Inflation 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Last month, you predicted the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates thanks to falling inflation. But today data showed that inflation rose more than expected for the third straight month. So how concerned are you about the fight against inflation stalling? And do you stand by your prediction for a rate cut?
President Biden. Well, I do stand by my prediction that before the year is out there will be a rate cut. This may delay it a month or so. I'm not sure of that. I don't—we don't know what the Fed is going to do for certain.
But, look, we have dramatically reduced inflation from 9 percent down to close to 3 percent. We're in a situation where we're better situated than we were when we took office, where we—inflation was skyrocketing. And we have a plan to deal with it, whereas the opposition—my opposition talks about two things. They just want to cut taxes for the wealthy and raise taxes on other people.
And so I think they're—they have no plan. Our plan is one I think is still sustainable.
Nippon Steal Corporation's Effort To Acquire United States Steal Corporation 
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, you said that the Nippon Steel acquisition of U.S. Steel is a private matter. But I'm wondering: Did you discuss the matter today with President Biden? And do you believe that politics are influencing President Biden's decision to oppose the deal?
And I wouldn't mind, Mr. President, if you answer that one too.
Prime Minister Kishida. On the issue that you have raised, we understand that discussions are underway between the parties. We hope these discussions will unfold in directions that would be positive for both sides.
Japan believes that appropriate procedures based on law is being implemented by the U.S. Government. Japan is the largest investor to the United States. Japanese businesses employ close to 1 million workers in the United States. And investment from Japan to the U.S. can only increase upwards in the months and years to come.
And we wish to cement this win-win relationship. Thank you.
President Biden. I stand by my commitment to American workers. I can—man of my word, I'm going to keep it. And with regard to that, I stand by our commitment to our alliance. This is exactly what we're doing—a strong alliance as well.
[Prime Minister Kishida began speaking, but his remarks were inaudible due to a technical malfunction.]
Interpreter. Prime Minister's microphone, please.
China-U.S. Relations/Japan-U.S. Relations 
Q. Nakakuki of Kyodo News. My question is to both Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden. At the summit, you confirmed your strong objections against unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion by China and agreed on reinforcing response capabilities.
Under current circumstances, should Japan and the United States bolster defense capabilities? China may become more preoccupied in military expansion and intensify its coercive behavior. That is the risk of—[inaudible]. In order to avoid divide and expand—avoid the divide, how should Japan and U.S. respond?
Prime Minister Kishida. Let me then take that question first. At this summit, we confirmed that the United States and Japan will resolutely defend and bolster a free and open international order based on the rule of law and that Japan and the United States, as global partners, shall work together for that purpose.
On challenges concerning China, including the point you raised on objecting to unilateral attempts to change status quo by force or coercion, we concurred that Japan and the United States as global partners shall work in close coordination. And also, as I said previously, we will continue our dialogue with China and we will cooperate with China in tackling common challenges. And the President and I confirmed the importance of such dialogue as well.
Based on the solid trust with our ally, the United States, we will continue to call on China to fulfill its responsibilities as a major power.
Japan's policy, which I have consistently embraced, is to comprehensively promote the mutual strategic relationship we have with China and establish a constructive and stable Japan-China relationship through efforts by both sides. That has been my consistent position that I have upheld. We will continue to seek close communication with China at all levels.
That's it for me.
President Biden. You know, first of all, we keep improving our lines of communications with one another—and that's the United States and China. We—I've met—I've recently spoken at length with President Xi. And we've agreed that we would, number one, have personal contact with one another whenever we want to discuss to anything so there'd be no—nothing lipped—nothing slips between, as they say—between the cup and the lip, so we know exactly what the other team is thinking. Number one.
And so we had a long discussion last—now almost—I guess almost 2 weeks ago now. And—the best way to reduce the chances of miscalculation and misunderstanding. That's number one.
Number two, in our alliance we have with Japan—is a purely defensive in nature. It's a defensive alliance. And the things we discussed today improve our cooperation and are purely about defense and readiness. It's not aimed at any one nation or a threat to the region. And it doesn't have anything to do with conflict. And so this is about restoring stability in the region. And I think we have a chance of doing that.
Okay. Third—the next question. Who—who do I call on next? Hang on a second. I've got my list here. Hang on. I apologize.
Aurelia of AFP [Aurelia End of Agence-France Presse].
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel/Israel's Military Operations in Gaza, Palestinian Territories/Hostages Held by Hamas 
Q. Thank you. My first question would go to both of you, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister. Is there a path for Japan to become a full member of AUKUS?
And I would have a second question for you, Mr. President. You're now saying that Benjamin Netanyahu is making a mistake in Gaza. What are you willing to do to make him change his strategy? And would you consider conditioning military aid to Israel? Thank you.
Prime Minister Kishida. Thank you. Your question about AUKUS, I will respond. Our country—we want to contribute to the peace and stability of the region. And therefore, we have consistently supported AUKUS.
Having said that, the participants of AUKUS—U.S., U.K., Australia—with such countries' bilateral relationship or in multilateral occasions, we have established various relationships. But for Japan, to have a direct cooperation with AUKUS, nothing has been decided at this moment.
Going forward with U.S., U.K., or with Australia—with such countries, in bilateral or multilateral frameworks, we will continue our cooperation so that they will continue to be considered.
At the moment, about the relationship between Japan and AUKUS, that's it.
President Biden. With regard to my discussions with Bibi Netanyahu—Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as our relationship with Israel, I have been very blunt and straightforward with the Prime Minister, as well as his war cabinet, as well as the Cabinet.
And the fact of the matter is that Bibi and I had a long discussion. He agreed to do several things that related to, number one, getting more aid—both food and medicine—into Gaza and reducing significantly the attempts—the civilian casualties in any action taken in the region.
And thus far—and we—and it's tied to the hostages. There are a number of hostages that are being held by a—by the—Hamas. And just yesterday, we were meeting with the Vice President and our National Security Adviser before that, and they—and there are American hostages as well. And they know how committed we are—the whole team—to getting their loved ones home, and we're not going to stop until we do.
The new proposal on the table—Bill Burns led the effort to—for us, and we're grateful for his work—there's a now—up to Hamas. They need to move on the proposal that's been made. And as I said, it would get these hostages home where they belong, but also bring back a 6-week—cease-fire that we need now.
And the fact is that we're—they're getting in somewhere, in the last 3 days, over a hundred trucks. It's not enough. But it needs to be more, and there's one more opening that has to take place in the north.
So we'll see what he does in terms of meeting the commitments he made to me.
Okay——
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. This will be the last reporter.
Prime Minister Kishida. Mr. Shimizu, please.
North Korea 
Q. Thank you. Shimizu [Shimizu Daishi] of NHK. I ask the question to both of you.
As Prime Minister Kishida mentioned, the abduction issue with North Korea, I believe, was discussed. Prime Minister, you have expressed your wish to have a direct engagement with Kim Jong Un. But they say that abduction is already result, which means that they are refusing. During the meeting, what did you tell President Biden about the outlook of a summit? And what engagement did you ask President Biden?
President Biden, my question: What did you hear from Prime Minister Kishida? And what is your observation and feeling, your President, with the nuclear missile issues? What is your position? Do you support the summit between Japan and North Korea? Thank you.
Prime Minister Kishida. First of all, if I may start, regarding my summit meeting with President Biden about North Korea, including the missile and nuclear issues we have discussed, and regarding the increasingly worrying situation, we have agreed to continue a close coordination.
And on top of that, we concurred that the window of a discussion with North Korea is open. And we discussed that Japan, U.S.—Japan, U.S., and R.O.K. will continue to work closely together.
I also asked for the continued understanding and cooperation for the immediate resolution of the abduction issue. And President Biden once again gave myself a very strong assurance regarding the recent announcement by North Korea.
I will refrain from commenting on each and every announcement by North Korea. But as I have been mentioning repeatedly, based on the perspective that the establishment of a meaningful relationship between Japan and North Korea is in the interest of both Japan and North Korea and that it could be hugely beneficial to the peace and stability of the region, my policy is to aim for a summit meeting with North Korea to resolve various issues and will advise high-level consultation directly under my instruction. And that remains unchanged.
That is my response.
President Biden. We did discuss this issue. We both agreed the D.P.R.K. must—must also address the serious human rights and humanitarian concerns of the international community, including the immediate resolution of the abduction issue.
But you know, the Prime Minister has just spoken to the potential of what his plans may mean. But welcome—I welcome the opportunity—we welcome the opportunity of our allies to initiate dialogue with the Democratic Republic of Korea.
As I've said many times, we're open to dialogue ourselves at any time, but without preconditions from the D.P.R.K.
So I have faith in the—Japan. I have faith in the Prime Minister. And I think his seeking a dialogue with them is a good thing. It's a positive thing.
Thank you. Thank——

"Apr 12, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-national-action-network-convention-and-exchange-with-reporters,Remarks to the National Action Network Convention and an Exchange With Reporters,"""[The President joined the event, which was held at the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel in New York City, by videoconference from the South Court Auditorium of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building.]
The President. Thank you, Rev. Thanks for that introduction. Look, we've known each other for a long time. I'm grateful not only for your leadership and partnership, but quite frankly, more importantly for your friendship.
And thanks to all of you, members of our Nation's most important civil rights organization. You know, for more than 30 years, the National Action Network has been on the frontlines in the work to redeem the soul of America. We've been on the same page, and the work is as important as it's ever been.
You know, during your convention, you heard from members of the most diverse administration in history—our administration—starting with our Vice President, Kamala Harris, who is doing an incredible job, in my view. And so is Steve Benjamin, who is with us—he is with you guys tonight right now.
Together, we've kept our promises to make some of the most significant investments in the Black American community ever. Promise kept to get through the pandemic and make sure the Black community was not left behind and everyone was taken care of; put checks in pockets and cut Black child poverty in half.
A promise kept to rebuild all of America, reconnecting Black communities that had been cut in half by interstate highway systems with jobs and opportunity as well, to ensure that every community has access to clean water and high-speed internet.
A promise kept to protect and expand Obamacare, saving Black families $800 a year on their premiums. A promise kept to beat Big Pharma by giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, literally saving countless lives in underserved communities.
For example, members of the Black community who need insulin now are only—for—because of their diabetes, now only have to pay $35 a month for insulin instead of $400 a month. And there's much more to come, by the way.
A promise kept to invest an historic $7 billion in HBCUs, to relieve student debt for more than 4 thousand—4 million people so far, including a significant number of Black borrowers, including, just today I announced another 277,000 Americans—a significant number of Black borrowers—are also having their debt forgiven.
A promise kept to advance justice: the first Black woman on the Supreme Court and more Black women confirmed for the Federal circuit court of appeals than all previous Presidents combined—every single one; the most important Executive order on police reform to ban chokeholds, greatly restrict no-knock warrants, advance effective and accountable community policing.
A promise kept to sign the most significant gun safety law in decades. The first law making lynching a Federal hate crime. Keeping my promise that no one should be in Federal prison for merely possessing marijuana.
A promise kept to advance environmental justice and to make the most significant investments in climate ever in all of our history. That's delivering clean energy and jobs all across America.
The results are real. We've reduced Black unemployment rate to its record low. More Black Americans have health insurance than ever before. More Black businesses are starting up than we've seen in the last 25 years.
In fact, despite attacks on our support for Brown and Black small businesses, we're investing in them as key ways to build generational wealth in communities. Today I'm proud to announce that last year we awarded $76 billion in Federal contracts to small, disadvantaged businesses to level the playing field and close the racial wealth gap.
I also want to thank my dear friend, HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge, for an amazing career in public service, for leading the charge in making housing more affordable, for proposing a $10,000 tax first-time home—$10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers to building more rental units to bring rents down than ever before.
We've launched a major effort to root out bias in home appraisal process so homes in Black communities are no longer undervalued compared to the same home in a white community. Thus far, we've eliminated that gap by 40 percent, and we're going to continue until it's even.
Put it all together, Black wealth is up 60 percent—up 60 percent—and the racial wealth gap has closed the most in 20 years. You know, I would argue this is transformational change. But we know there's much more work to do. There are real threats we face.
There are more extreme voices out there who simply don't want to see people of color in the future of our country. They want to turn back the clock—voter suppression; election suppression; ripping away reproductive freedom; getting affirmative action—gutting it and attacking diversity across American life; banning books—this is 2024—banning books, attempting to erase history; embracing political violence, like what happened on January the 6th.
These extremists are determined to erase the progress we've made. But together, we are determined to make history, not erase it—make history, not erase it.
Let me close with this, Rev. You know, we face a moment of choosing at a time when our very democracy is at stake. And that's not an exaggeration. Our democracy is at stake.
One vision is propelled by anger, hate, revenge, and retribution. The other vision—our vision, your vision—of perseverance, progress, hope, and optimism, and everything the National Action Network stands for and embodies.
Here's the future we can build together. I see an America where we defend democracy, we don't diminish it. I see an America where, with your help, I sign the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act into law, where I sign the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act into law, where we make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. And we can do that.
I see a future where we give hate no safe harbor and call out the poison of White supremacy.
I see an America where the economy grows from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, and where the wealthy finally begin to pay their fair share of taxes, where working people finally have a fair shot, with childcare, eldercare, paid leave. We're one of the only nations in the world that doesn't have paid leave.
I see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. You know, my administration just yesterday expanded—2 days ago expanded background checks. But that's not enough. We'll ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We did it once; we've got to do it again. We must get it done.
And, folks, I know we can do this. I've never been more optimistic about our future.
You know, we just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. We've come out of every crisis stronger than we've gone into it. And there's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together.
So let's keep acting together. I'm looking to you for help. I'm looking to you for your leadership, and I hope you look to me for the same.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you very much.

I was reminiscing with the Prime Minister very briefly as you walked in the door. Twenty-five years ago, almost to the day, I was standing on the Senate floor arguing for the admission of Czechoslovakia, at the time—the Czech Republic—into NATO. Twenty-five years. I was a pretty smart guy. [Laughter]
The best decision we made. You've been a great, great ally. And we've only grown closer and stronger as nations, both the United States and the Czech Republic.
Together, we're deepening defense cooperation to ensure the security of our people, as well as including the modernization of your military force with the purchase of F-35 aircraft and helos. It's just amazing what you're doing.
And together, we're going to bolster our energy security and expand our clean power. We're going to get to talk about that in some detail in a little bit.
And together, we're standing—and I can't tell you how much we appreciate your outspokenness and the support of the people of Czechoslovakia—the Czech Republic with defending the people of Ukraine, as defined by what you've done. You continue to just speak out.
I want to thank you for helping—Mr. Prime Minister, for helping secure nearly 1 million rounds of ammunition for Ukraine. And I'm committed to—we're committed to doing our part.
The Congress has to pass the continued funding——
[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]
Excuse me—which has been significant from the United States and pass our bipartisan national security bill. They have to do it now—now. There's overwhelming support in the House and Senate if they'll—the Speaker will just let a vote take place.
And, you know, because as the Czech Republic remembers: Russia won't stop in Ukraine. Russia will not stop in Ukraine. The impact on NATO would be significant. And Putin is going to keep going, putting Europe, the United States, and the entire world at risk if we don't stop him in Ukraine.
And so, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you, again, for being here today. I look forward to our discussion. And I'm really delighted you're here—really delighted you're here.
Prime Minister Fiala. Thank you.
President Biden. The floor is yours.
Prime Minister Fiala. Mr. President, thank you very much for your invitation and warm welcome. It's nice to be here.
The relations between our countries are now very strong. And they have also a long tradition. The United States had a main role in founding of independent Czechoslovakia. Our first President, Masaryk, had an American wife. And the Czech community in the U.S. is largest we have abroad.
Here, I can mention Madeline Albright——
President Biden. Yes.
Prime Minister Fiala. ——as an excellent example. She was the U.S. Secretary of State but also a Czech native from Prague.
We are part——
The President. And let me know it all the time.
Prime Minister Fiala. Yes, yes, yes. [Laughter]
We are partners in NATO. And we work together in defense and business. And most important is—most important—that we share the same values: human rights, freedom, democracy.
And we need to deal with challenges like Russian aggression in Ukraine, terrorism, difficult situation in the Middle East. And in such a situation, deep security cooperation between democratic countries is a must.
Mr. President, I appreciate your leadership in support of Ukraine. We are also doing our best to help Ukraine and to stop Putin's aggression.
In 1968, I was a little boy. In 1968, I saw Russian tanks in the streets of my town. And I don't want to see this again.
So we must continue to support Ukraine as long as possible. That is the reason why we started Czech ammunition initiative. It will provide Ukraine with hundreds of thousands of artillery shells very soon. It will happen in next few weeks and months.
And Czechia is also country with most Ukrainian refugees per capita in Europe, maybe in the world.
The international situation is very difficult globally, and our cooperation is very important for stability in Central and Eastern Europe.
And you mentioned: I am glad that my government made some important decisions in defense and security. We agreed on the defense cooperation agreement, and we decided to get F-35 fighter jets for Czech army. This is very important. It will make our cooperation and security much stronger.
Also, business relations are developing very well. Our trade exchange is bigger every year. And we have now some Czech companies investing millions of dollars in the U.S.——
President Biden. Sure.
Prime Minister Fiala. ——and employing thousands of Americans. I'm very proud of that.
President Biden. So are we.
Prime Minister Fiala. Mr. President, I believe my visit will make our nation stronger and will bring more benefits for our countries. I look forward to our meeting, and I will be happy to discuss these things in detail.
Thank you, once again, Mr. President, for your invitation and kind, welcoming words.

Well, Mr. Prime Minister, welcome. Welcome to the White House. Welcome to the Oval Office.
The—before I begin, I want to discuss some of the events that took place in the Middle East the past weekend. As you know, Iran launched an unprecedented aerial attack against Israel, and we mounted an unprecedented military effort to defend Israel. And together with our partners, we defeated that attack.
The United States is committed to Israel's security. We're committed to a cease-fire that will bring the hostages home and prevent any conflict from spreading beyond what it already has.
We're also committed to the security of our personnel and partners in the region, including Iraq. The partnership between Iraq and the United States is critical. We've seen over the last decade as our troops have served side by side to help defeat ISIS, and we've seen this in our strategic framework agreement as well.
And I want to personally thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for your focus on strengthening Iraq's economy and energy independence. That's a goal we share today with you, and we're going to discuss that later today.
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you again for being here. Thank you for making the effort to be here. Simply put, our partnership is pivotal for our nations, for the Middle East, and, I believe, for the world.
Again, welcome, and the floor is yours.
Prime Minister Sudani. Thank you, Mr. President, in the name of God. Thank you, Mr. President, for this invitation that comes at a sensitive time. Despite your domestic engagement in the light of the developments on the international stage, this shows the importance of this visit and meeting.
This visit and meeting are significant in the history of the bilateral relations between our two countries. The relationship between Iraq and the United States is at an important juncture.
We aim to discuss the sustainable foundations for a 360-degree strategic partnership, ensuring a smooth and systematic transition to—from a military, security-based relationship to a comprehensive economic, political, environmental, educational, and security partnership according to the strategic framework agreement.
The war against ISIS/Daesh formed the foundation of our relations over the course of the past decade. Mr. President, we have fought together, and we have achieved victory together. And we have achieved a remarkable victory thanks to the sacrifices of the Iraqi people and the unity of all the components and the support of the international community and the global coalition.
Iraq today is recovering, witnessing service projects, infrastructure repairs. And we are going to discuss today our sustainable partnership according to the strategic framework agreement. We have laid down the transition methodology, according to the HMC, High Military Committee, the HMC that is tasked to assess the level of a threat operation on environmental requirements and the capability of the ISF, Iraqi Security Forces. And we will be committed to the outcomes of this committee.
And we also have a Joint Security Cooperation Dialogue that will lay the foundation for a sustainable bilateral relationship between the two partners in the security and military fields.
Most importantly, the HCC, the High Coordination Committee, is actually—have met today and discussed many things. My government is very serious about activating the strategic framework agreement. There are many benefits that are going—coming out of this for the two friendly countries of us.
Mr. President, I came today and carrying the concerns of my people, who aspire for services, for prosperity. And—but that does not mean that we forget about our humanitarian responsibility, about what's happening in the region.
And in the spirit of partnership, we may—our views may be divergent about what's happening there in the region, but we agree certainly about the international law, the international humanitarian law, and the responsibility to protect under the law of war. And we reject any aggression against the civilians, especially women and children. And we encourage the commitment not to—about respecting international norms and diplomatic missions.
We—as humanity, we need a system that respect these laws. And we think if we kept silent about what's happening, that we will establish a precedent that will be followed, whether it is bad or good precedent.
We're actually very eager about stopping this war, which claimed the life of thousands of civilians—women and children. And we encourage all the efforts about stopping the expansion of the area of conflict, especially the latest development. And we encourage all—for restraints and to protect the safety and security of the region.
Thank you, Mr. President.
President Biden. Thank you.

Q. Mr. President, will you talk about the war memorial you were just at very briefly? What did you see? What did you hear?
The President. I wanted to see where my uncle Ambrose J. Finnegan was memorialized. And there was a World War II memorial built for those who lost their lives in World War II.
And when D-Day occurred, the next day, on Monday, all four of my mother's brothers went down and volunteered to join the military. And four of them—three of them made it. One was 4-F, couldn't go.
And Ambrose Finnegan—we called him ""Uncle Bosie""—he was shot down. He was Army Air Corps before there was an Air Force. He flew single-engine planes, reconnaissance flights over New Guinea. He had volunteered because someone couldn't make it. He got shot down in an area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time.
They never recovered his body. But the Government went back, when I went down there, and they checked and found some parts of the plane and the like.
And what I was thinking about when I was standing there was when Trump refused to go up to the memorial for veterans in Paris, and he said they were a bunch of ""suckers"" and ""losers.""
To me, that is such a disqualifying assertion made by a President—""suckers"" and ""losers."" The guys who saved civilization in the 1940s—""suckers"" and ""losers.""

A Proclamation
This Education and Sharing Day, USA, we remember the life and legacy of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, as the leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement and recommit to our shared values of honesty, dignity, and equal justice that he long championed and that have made America strong.
Forced to flee Nazi-occupied Europe during one of history's darkest moments, the Rebbe found a new home and purpose in America. In the wake of the Holocaust, he led hundreds of thousands to deepen their faith. As a prolific scholar and teacher, his calls for new schools and community centers inspired people to build them in all 50 States and across the globe, and they moved generations to embrace education not only as a means of self-improvement but as an essential path to a more just society. Here in America, he also offered counsel to some of my predecessors as President, always advocating for our Nation's role as a beacon of hope in the world.
We honor the Rebbe's birthday every year, but we know this year is different. Violence and cruelty have reminded us that hate never goes away—it only hides. Silence is complicity, and America will not be silent. As Americans, we reject terrorism and will keep working unequivocally to combat antisemitism at every turn. My Administration remains dedicated to Israel's security, and here at home, we have been implementing America's first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. We will give hate no safe harbor.
The Rebbe knew that education is fundamental to cultivating understanding and acceptance. It opens us up to one another, and it builds not just knowledge but character, as well as an awareness of something bigger than ourselves. The Rebbe's beliefs are reflected in the American creed that every person is created equal and deserves to be treated equally throughout their lives, starting with access to a quality education—a mission my Administration shares.
As we approach the 30th anniversary of the Rebbe's passing, we honor his work by celebrating our common faith in our Nation and by working to ensure that every American has a chance to learn, grow, and thrive—in the classroom and as caring and courageous people.
Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 19, 2024, as Education and Sharing Day, USA. I call upon government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.

This holiday reminds us of a profound and powerful truth: that even in the face of persecution, if we hold on to faith, we shall endure and overcome.
As Jews mark Passover with storytelling, songs, and rituals, they will also read from the Haggadah how, in every generation, they have been targeted by those who would seek to destroy them. This year, those words carry deeper resonance and pain in the wake of Hamas' unspeakable evil on October 7, the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. More than 1,200 people were brutally massacred. Women and girls were subjected to appalling sexual violence. More than 250 innocents were taken hostage, including Americans. We can never forget the horror of Hamas' despicable atrocities.
Jews around the world are still coping with the trauma of that day and its aftermath. This Passover falls particularly hard on hostage families trying to honor the spirit of the holiday—a story centered on freedom—while their loved ones remain in captivity. Our hearts are with all the victims, survivors, families, and friends whose loved ones have been killed, taken hostage, wounded, displaced, or are in harm's way.
My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. My administration is working around the clock to free the hostages, and we will not rest until we bring them home. We are also working to establish an immediate and prolonged cease-fire in Gaza as a part of a deal that releases the hostages and delivers desperately needed humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians. We will continue to work toward a two-state solution that provides equal security, prosperity, and enduring peace for Israelis and Palestinians. And we are leading international efforts to ensure Israel can defend itself against Iran and its proxies, including by directing the U.S. military to help defend Israel against Iran's unprecedented attacks last weekend.
The ancient story of persecution against Jews in the Haggadah also reminds us that we must speak out against the alarming surge of anti-Semitism: in our schools, communities, and online. Silence is complicity. Even in recent days, we've seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. This blatant anti-Semitism is reprehensible and dangerous, and it has absolutely no place on college campuses or anywhere in our country. My administration will continue to speak out and aggressively implement the first-ever National Strategy To Counter Anti-Semitism, putting the full force of the Federal Government behind protecting the Jewish community.
This year, let us remember the central Passover theme that even in the darkest of times, the promise of God's protection will give us strength to find hope, resilience, and redemption.

The President. It's a good day for America, it's a good day for Europe, and it's a good day for world peace, for real. This is consequential. I just signed into law the national security package that was passed by the House of Representatives this weekend and by the Senate yesterday.
It's going to make America safer. And it's going to make the world safer. And it continues America's leadership in the world, and everyone knows it.
It gives vital support to America's partners and they—so they can defend themselves against threats to their sovereignty and to the lives and freedom of their citizens. And it's an investment in our own security, because when our allies are stronger—and I want to make this point again and again—when our allies are stronger, we are stronger.
I'm grateful for all—grateful to all those in Congress—Democrats, Republicans, Independents—who voted for this bill.
It's a path—to my desk, it was a difficult path. It should have been easier, and it should have gotten there sooner. But in the end, we did what America always does: We rose to the moment, we came together, and we got it done.
Now we need to move fast, and we are.
Over 2 years, Russia has been responsible for a brutal campaign against Ukraine. They've killed tens of thousands of Ukrainians, bombed hospitals—deliberately picked them out—bombed hospitals, kindergartens, grain silos; tried to plunge Ukraine into a cold and dark winter by striking their power grid.
Ukrainians have fought—the Ukrainians have fought back, defending their country and their families with extraordinary courage. Many of you have been there with me many times. It's amazing what they do. I mean, it's amazing, against such a larger military.
Ukraine has regained over half the territory that Russia took from them in this invasion. And they won important victories against Russia's navy. But make no mistake about, they're a fighting force with the will and the skill to win—the will and the skill to win. For months, while MAGA Republicans were blocking aid, Ukraine has been running out of artillery shells and ammunition.
Meanwhile, Putin's friends keep giving him—are keeping him well supplied. Iran sent him drones. North Korea has sent him ballistic missiles and artillery shells. China is providing components and know-how to boost Russia's defense production.
With all this support, Russia has ramped up its airstrikes against Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure, rained down munitions on brave Ukrainians defending their homeland. And now Americans are going to send Ukraine the supplies they need to keep them in the fight.
This weekend, there were reports—and this is—I find this amazing. There were reports of cheers breaking out of the trenches in eastern Ukraine—probably came from one of your folks, a reporter or someone. I'm not sure where it came from. But that they're cheering as they watched the House vote in support for Ukraine.
It's not like they don't understand what we've done. Not like they don't understand how critical this is for them.
I'm making sure the shipments start right away. In the next few hours—literally, the few hours—we're going to begin sending equipment to Ukraine for air defense munitions, for artillery, for rocket systems; and armored vehicles.
You know, this package is literally an investment, not only in Ukraine's security but in Europe's security, in our own security.
We're sending Ukraine equipment from our own stockpiles, and then we'll replenish those stockpiles with new products made by American companies here in America: Patriot missiles made in Arizona, Javelins made in Alabama, artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas.
In other words, we're helping Ukraine while at the same time investing in our own industrial base, strengthening our own national security, and supporting jobs in nearly 40 States all across America.
You know, the United States is not acting alone, to state the obvious. Our allies in Europe and around the world, who for—constantly been asking me: ""Are we going to step up? We're not going to walk away, are we? How many""—and some of you have been in these international meetings with me. They're very concerned. Had we failed to step up, Lord only knows what would happen to the cohesion of NATO.
We're also sending—they're also sending significant help to Ukraine. We're all standing together against this brutal dictator.
As I've argued for months, this is directly—directly—in the United States national security interest. If Putin triumphs in Ukraine, the next move of Russian forces could very well be a direct attack on a NATO ally. And you all know full well that invoking article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty would be the first thing that comes to mind, which declares an attack on one is an attack on all.
If Putin attacks a NATO ally, like he's attacking Ukraine today, we'd have no choice but to come to their aid, just like our NATO allies came to our aid after the September 11 attacks here. That's why we're supporting and surging support now to Ukraine: to stop Putin from drawing the United States into a war in Europe and in the future.
You know, it seems to me we should take a little bit of a step back and realize what a critical moment this was for the United States and for NATO. This is a historical moment.
In the last 2 years, we've helped unify, strengthen, and expand NATO. Imagine if instead we had failed—we had failed—to step up now and to support Ukraine. All those gains would have begun to unravel, the cohesion of NATO would have been weakened, and our national security would have been undermined, without any question.
You know, Putin started this war believing he could easily break the will of the people of Ukraine. When that failed, he changed his strategy a little bit, thinking he could break the will of NATO, break the will of the United States, break our will. Well, he's failed again.
America stands with our friends. We stand up against dictators. We bow to no one—to no one—certainly not Vladimir Putin.
Look, this bill also includes vital support for Israel. Just 10 days ago, we saw Iran launch over 100 missiles and drones at Israel. And because of them and other allies across the country—world, including from the region, none—no serious damage occurred. An unprecedented attack that followed years of Iran supporting Hizballah, Hamas, and proxies of their own—their own attack on Israel. They fund these guys.
My commitment to Israel, I want to make clear again, is ironclad. The security of Israel is critical. I will always make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Iran and terrorists it supports. And with this aid, the United States can help replenish Israel's air defense and provide other critical defense so Iran can never carry out the destruction it intended with its attack 10 days ago.
But, at the same time, this bill significantly—significantly—increases humanitarian assistance we're sending to the innocent people of Gaza, who are suffering badly. They're suffering the consequences of this war that Hamas started. And we've been working intently for months to get as much aid to Gaza as possible.
This bill includes $1 billion for additional humanitarian aid in Gaza. We're going to immediately secure that aid and surge it—surge it—including food, medical supplies, clean water. And Israel must make sure all this aid reaches the Palestinians in Gaza without delay.
And everything we do is guided by the ultimate goal of bringing these hostages home, securing a cease-fire, and setting the conditions for an enduring peace.
You know, there's more that this bill does, and as you all know, the press here, including providing for support to strengthen even further our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as humanitarian aid to places including Haiti, Sudan, and Somalia.
But there's one thing this bill does not do: border security.
You know, just this year, I proposed and negotiated and agreed to the strongest border security bill this country has ever, ever, ever seen. It was bipartisan. It should have been included in this bill, and I'm determined to get it done for the American people. But I'll come back to that in another moment—another time.
This is a reminder of what America can do when we come together, despite our differences.
I want to thank everyone in Congress who made it possible, especially the bipartisan leadership: Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Leader Jeffries, Leaders Schumer and McConnell. They don't always agree, but when it matters most, they stepped up and did the right thing. And I mean this sincerely, history will remember this time. History will remember this moment.
For all the talk about how dysfunctional things are in Washington, when you look over the past 3 years, we see that time and again on the critical issues we've actually come together. It hasn't always been easy, but when it's come time to decide to rebuild America, we did it with the bipartisan infrastructure law, which is just underway.
When it came time to invest in our semiconductor industry and technical—technologic—technologies of the future, we did it with the CHIPS and Science Act. And when it came time to stand with Ukraine and Israel and help the people of Gaza, we did that as well.
At the end of the day, most of us—whether we're Democrats, Republicans, or Independents—believe that America must stand up for what is right. We don't walk away from our allies, we stand with them. We don't let tyrants win, we oppose them. We don't merely watch global events unfold, we shape them.
That's what it means to be the indispensable nation. That's what it means to be the world's superpower and the world's leading democracy.
Some of our MAGA Republican friends reject that vision, but this vote makes it clear: There is a bipartisan consensus for that kind of American leadership. And that's exactly what we'll continue to deliver.
I thank you all very much. And now I'm going off to make a speech at a hotel that I am late for. And I'll have plenty of time to answer questions on this and other matters.
Thank you."""

Q. The little—the little girl. How did that go?
The President. That went really well. Her dad sent me—her—excuse me—her family sent me a note saying she was riding home, and she said, ""You know, I love Joe Biden.""
Q. We're told that she did a lot of playing.
The President. She did.
Q. And had you seen—can you discuss that a little bit. Was she outside, inside? She was playing a lot?

We emphasize that the deal on the table to release the hostages would bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza, that would facilitate a surge of additional necessary humanitarian assistance to be delivered throughout Gaza, and lead to the credible end of hostilities. Gazans would be able to return to their homes and their lands with preparations beforehand to ensure shelter and humanitarian provisions.

Before I begin, I want a promise. When they say, ""Joe Biden is in the outer room to see the President,"" you won't say, ""Joe who?"" [Laughter]
God love you. You're a good man. [Laughter]
Actor Michael Douglas. Thank you.
The President. Thank you.
Mr. Douglas. Thank you. God bless you.
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Mr. Douglas. Thank you so much.
The President. Sit down, folks, please.
Dylan, thank you for that introduction. And—and your sister, she is—she could be President too, maybe, if she wants. [Laughter]
And your dad Michael, I—Michael and I have something in common: We both married way above our station. [Laughter] Some things are just self-evident, in my opinion. [Laughter]
Catherine couldn't be here, but I'm grateful for her sharing her family tonight. And by the way, she's in——
[At this point, the President briefly imitated an Irish accent.]
——Dublin, holy God, you know. [Laughter] The place—the only place I'm positive I could win. I could be elected Taoiseach in Dublin. [Laughter]
I went back to Mayo to my—I—because we were trying to get the Irish accords through—together. And I quote, as my—no family member has been in Ireland since 1848 or something like that. But I went to speak at a cathedral in Mayo that my great-great-grandfather had made the bricks for. He was an—and in Ireland, everything is about your lineage. They keep, you know, doing your background.
And so I stood out along the river in Mayo with 32,000 people, pouring rain, and they stood there and listened. I decided I don't know why the hell my family ever moved. [Laughter]
But anyway, she's in Dublin, and tell her I love her.
Look, and, of course, Michael was a great ""American President."" He—[laughter]—he was single at the time. [Laughter] I wonder what the hell that would be like. [Laughter]
It was bad enough when I lost my first wife and my child, and I was a new U.S. Senator. I saw that I got put on the 10 most eligible bachelors list in America. And I swore, after a year, I've never going to go out with anybody again in my whole life. [Laughter]
It's an unusual situation. I don't know how you movie stars handle it. [Laughter]
You know, look, and it's great that he's one of our Founding Fathers now. [Laughter] I was the Ben Franklin Professor of Presidential History at the University of Pennsylvania for 4 years, teaching at Penn. And Ben was right: If we can keep it—that's what it was all about.
I now have a portrait in the Oval Office, when you come and see it, of Ben Franklin to remind everybody that, you know, I knew him really well. [Laughter] He was only a couple of years older than I was, but you know? [Laughter]
But look, it's a reminder of the incredible history of our Nation and the future that's within our reach.
You know, I also include Rodge and Barbara and all of the cohosts of this event to thank them for their support. It really makes a big difference. You know, I know you have a lot more important things to do, a lot of things that you can be doing, and stepping up and doing what you're doing for me, it really makes a big difference, including the Members of Congress who are here today.
Representative Bowman, thanks for the welcoming me into your district. I got a passport to come in. [Laughter]
And, Mondaire Jones, who needs to win in November—Mondaire, you know—one of my best friends in Congress for—she's much, much younger than I am, but—[Laughter]—Nita Lowey. Nita, I love you.
As we head into the spring, we generally feel a bit of excitement building here, you know, in this campaign. So far, we have 1.5 million people who've contributed to our campaign—1.5 million; 550,000 new since 2020. And 97 percent are under $200—97 percent.
We're almost—we've raised almost a quarter of a billion dollars so far.
And so, look, we've ramped—133 campaign headquarters and field offices, and we hired hundreds of staff all across the country before Trump and his MAGA Republican friends even have one single office open. So—and it's good out there. It feels good out there.
I've been going—I haven't had a chance to watch the court proceedings—[laughter]—because I've been—[laughter]—because I've been out campaigning in all the States.
And while the press doesn't write about it, the momentum is clearly in our favor. Polls are moving towards us and away from Trump. The last 23 polls, we're ahead in 10 of them, and he's ahead in 8, and we're tied in 5.
And just 2 days ago, we got the best polls we've ever seen. NPR/Marist poll, which is considered one of the best in the country, we're ahead by 5 among all voters and 6 by voters who are likely to vote. That's 50—53 to 47. And it keeps moving. Every single week, things are getting better.
But what's more important is what actually—people when they actually vote. Just 2 days ago, the Pennsylvania primary, we beat Trump's turnout by 150,000 more votes voted for me than voted for Trump. Democrats are strongly behind us, and he's losing a lot of Republicans, still, to Nikki Haley in that primary. [Laughter]
We're also getting major endorsements. Yesterday I received the endorsement of the North American Building Trades. Over 3,500 people showed up. It's the biggest in our Nation and a strong key to battleground States like Wisconsin and Michigan. They have a very strong presence there.
But look, I know not everyone is feeling the enthusiasm. Just the other day, a defeated-looking guy came up to me and said: ""Mr. President, I'm being crushed by debt. I'm completely wiped out."" And I had to tell him: ""Donald, I'm sorry. I can't help you."" [Laughter] ""I'm not—I'm just not in the position to do it."" [Laughter]
Trump is in trouble, unrelated to me and related to me, no matter—and he knows it.
Earlier this week, I was in Florida, where they're about to implement one of the most extensive and extreme abortion bans in the country. There's only one reason and one person responsible: It's Donald Trump.
He's worried voters are going to hold him accountable for overriding—overturning Roe v. Wade and all the cruelty and chaos that's been created. But he said—he asked voters to give him credit for it. He claimed that he was the reason why. He appointed those folks.
Look, we—I have news for Trump: The voters are going to hold him accountable. Mark my words, it's going to move millions of voters of women and men at the polls—to the polls this year.
And I've said many times, Trump and his MAGA crowd don't have a clue about the power of women. You know, when—[applause]—no, I really mean it.
You may remember, in the Court's decision, it said, but women—when they changed it, they said there's no constitutional right—Federal—but it's up to the States. They said: ""But women have a vote. Women have a vote. They can do something about it,"" almost with tongue in cheep—cheek.
Well, he—we reelected Kamala and me with a Democratic Congress—if we do that, I promise you, Roe v. Wade will be the law of the land again. I guarantee it.
But look, folks, chaos is nothing new to Trump. His Presidency was chaos. Not a joke. Trump is trying to make the country forget just how dark and unsettling it was when he was President, but we'll never forget.
We'll never forget how—him lying about COVID, telling the American people to inject bleach into their arms. He injected it into his hair. He got it wrong. [Laughter] He got—he missed. But—but all—but all—all kidding aside, that's what he said.
And you know, he did that interview acknowledging that he knew it was a serious proposition [problem; White House correction], but he didn't want anybody to know. He said it's going to go away by thanks—remember all that?
Well, guess what? Over—well over a million people died. They died.
We'll never forget the—his love letters to Kim Jong Un of North Korea and his admiration for Putin. He talks about how smart Putin is and how, if he wants to move into Ukraine or anywhere else, have at it if they're not doing enough for us.
We'll never forget him wanting tear gas to be sprayed on peaceful protesters outside the White House, and then holding a Bible upside down. Now he's writing his own Bible, and he's trying—[laughter]—and he's trying to sell it.
Look, and we'll certainly never forget the insurrection of June 6—January 6, excuse me—and those dark days of history. The idea that that wasn't an insurrection, I don't—I don't—understand it.
Off the Oval Office—and I hope some of you come and visit. Off that Oval Office, there's a small dining room. He sat there for 2 hours watching on television, watching the chaos, not doing a damn single thing. Policemen died. People were, in fact, badly hurt. I mean, it's never—it's just—it's nothing short of the Revolutionary—of the—excuse me, the Civil War—hasn't been even close. It was one of the worst derelictions of duty of any President in American history.
And we want to go back to that—any of that?
Look, look how far we've come. Since we've been in office, we've created 15 million brandnew jobs, more jobs in that short of time of any President in American history. More people have health insurance today than ever before in the history of this country, and it's working and it's increasing.
We took on Big Pharma. You know, I can put you in Air Force One when we take off here. And you have a prescription from any drug company in America, and you can bring that with me—with you. I can fly you to Toronto. I can fly you to London. I can fly you to Berlin, to any country, any capital in the world, and you can get that same prescription for 40- to 60-percent less than you get it here.
Well, we won. We lowered prescription drug costs, like 35 bucks for insulin instead of 400 bucks a month for all those people with diabetes.
We've made historic investments in rebuilding the country with these computer chips. I was just—I was just—had an—did a major event up in Syracuse, where the landmark preliminary agreement between my administration and Micron, a microchip manufacturer. We came up with $6.1 billion in funding this CHIPS program. We used to create 40—we used to make 40 percent of them. We're now down to zero—zero number.
We paired that—Micron—Micron came along and said, ""Okay, if you're going to come up with $6 billion, we're going to come up with $125 billion,"" to invest in New York State alone to build chip facilities right here in New York. The single biggest investment ever made in the history of this State—ever.
We've made the most significant investment on climate ever and the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. And we have much more to do. By the way, now they're trying to take down the gun laws we passed.
We should—I was part of one of two people who got—when I was a Senator, we outlawed assault weapons. And guess what? They're back. They're back. There's no legitimate reason whatsoever for anybody to be able to own an assault weapon. I taught constitutional law: You have the right to own a gun, but from the very beginning, it was not an absolute right. You weren't allowed to buy a cannon when you were in 1800. [Laughter] You—no, I'm—no, I'm serious.
You know, I love these guys who say that ""the blood,"" the—you know, ""the blood of liberty is""—he goes—they're full of malarkey. [Laughter]
And by the way, no one—no one—should own a weapon without a background check. Nobody.
And, folks, when I ran, I made a commitment. I said I want an administration that was going to look like America. I placed more Black women in the circuit courts of appeal than every other single President in the history of the United States. I put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court.
I could go on, but the point is, it's—this is all at stake. Trump wants to get rid of everything we've done. He's been very clear about it.
Trump is determined to, quote—he—I love this phrase—he's going to ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act. Why? Because it was Obamacare, and now it's on steroids. And guess what? It's saving a lot of lives—you know, the thousands of thousands, millions of people who have preexisting conditions who wouldn't be able to get insurance otherwise. He can't stand it, being associated with Barack.
He's determined to get rid of the climate law. Why? Because he does not believe there's a climate crisis.
I have, since I've been President, flown over—because of the crises we've had, flown over more forest fires and more flooding that has wiped out places than the entire State of Maryland—the entire—it would take up the entire State of Maryland.
Look, he's determined—he's determined—to cut taxes for a lot of you. Well, I don't—I don't think you should be paying more taxes, except for one thing: You know, there's a thousand billionaires in America. You know what their average tax rate is? Eight-point-three percent. Anybody want to trade? Raise your hand. [Laughter]
No, I'm serious. If they just had a 25-percent tax rate—not even the highest tax rate—we'd raise $400 billion over the next 10 years; be able to continue to do what I've already done, lower the deficit and not raise it; and be able to have childcare, be able to have eldercare, be able to do things that other countries are doing that make life easier for everybody and grow the economy.
And by the way, he wants to not only raise—have another major $2 trillion tax cut, he—while he wants to cut Social Security and Medicare and do such other—significant other damage.
But the biggest threat that Trump poses is to our democracy. I really believe that. Some of you may remember when I ran—because you helped me the first time—I indicated that—I spoke—made a speech at—when I was in Independence Hall in Philadelphia. And I said our democracy was at stake. And the press said, ""What are you talking about democracy for?"" Well, guess what? Even then, 60 percent of the people agreed with me. Our democracy literally is at stake.
Above all, what's at risk in 2024 is our freedom—basic freedoms and democracy.
And by the way, when you talk about taking away a woman's right to choose, we're well beyond that now. They want to take away the right for contraception, take away the right to marry, take away a whole range of things that Clarence Thomas talked about no longer being guaranteed in the Federal Constitution.
Trump not only embraces the violence of January 6, he's running on it. I mean, he's running on it. He calls the insurrectionists who are in prison—he calls them ""patriots,"" and, if reelected, he says he's going to pardon them. He means it.
You know, now Trump says if he loses again, there will be a ""bloodbath."" My—let me—no President—no President in modern—in—not in modern—in history has said those kinds of things.
Folks, we have to say with one voice, as Americans—as Democrats, as Independents—that there's no place ever in America for political violence. It's just never, never, never justified. Period.
Look, let me close with this. This election is about a competing vision of America. Trump's vision is one of anger, hate, revenge, retribution. That's what he talks about.
I have a very different view. I have a view of hope and optimism.
I've been doing this a long time. I know I only look like I'm 40, but I'm a little older. [Laughter]
But all kidding aside, I've never been more optimistic about America's prospects than I am today. We have the strongest economy in the world. The rest of the world looks to us.
Imagine had they—not finally passed the legislation for Israel and for—and for Ukraine. We are, as Madeleine Albright said, the essential nation. That's a fact.
Who leads the world without us? No, I just—I mean, I'm being literal. I'm not being figurative.
Look, I see an America defined by democracy, not diminished by it. I see an America where we protect our freedoms, not take them away. I see an America where the economy grows from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.
My dad, who was a hard-working guy, a well-read man who never got to—he got accepted to Johns Hopkins during the war for his—as they say in Baltimore——
[The President briefly imitated a Baltimore accent.]
——from Baltimore—and—but he never got to go. My dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and have a chance. Just an even chance.""
Where working people finally get a fair shot, where health care is a right, not a privilege—a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. These aren't crazy ideas. These are basic ideas that the vast majority of American people agree with.
Folks, this election is about democracy. It's not hyperbole. It's about democracy, freedom, America. This is why I need you.
I know we can do this together. As I said, I've never been more optimistic. Not a joke. And I've been doing this a long time. I was in the Senate for 36 years, Vice President for 8 years, and President going on 4. I may not be the smartest guy in the room, but I have more experience and wisdom on this stage than most anybody's ever held the office. And I'm telling you, we have to win this race. We have to win this race.
We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing beyond our capacity—nothing—when we do it together.
So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you."""

A Proclamation
For centuries, the perseverance, hope, and unshakeable faith of the Jewish people have inspired people around the world. During Jewish American Heritage Month, we celebrate the immeasurable impact of Jewish values, contributions, and culture on our Nation's character and recommit to realizing the promise of America for all Jewish Americans.
In 1654, a small band of 23 Jewish refugees fled persecution abroad and sailed into the port of modern-day New York City. They fought for religious freedom, helping define one of the bedrock principles upon which our Nation was built. Jewish American culture has been inextricably woven into the fabric of our country. Jewish American suffragists, activists, and leaders marched for civil rights, women's rights, and voting rights. Jewish American scientists, doctors, and engineers have made scientific breakthroughs that define America as a land of possibilities. They have served our Nation in uniform, on the Nation's highest courts, and at the highest levels of my Administration. As public servants, artists, entertainers, journalists, and poets, they have helped write the story of America, making it—as Emma Lazarus' poem on the Statue of Liberty states—a home for the ""huddled masses yearning to breathe free.""
As we celebrate the Jewish American community's contributions this month, we also honor their resilience in the face of a long and painful history of persecution. Hamas' brutal terrorist attack on October 7th against Israel marked the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, resurfacing, including here in the United States, painful scars from millennia of antisemitism and genocide of Jewish people. Jews across the country and around the world are still coping with the trauma and horror of that day and the months since. Our hearts are with all the victims, survivors, families, and friends whose loved ones were killed, wounded, displaced, or taken hostage—including women and girls whom Hamas has subjected to appalling acts of rape and sexual violence.
As I said after Hamas' terror attack, my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. The recent attack by Iran, firing a barrage of hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, reminds us of the existential threats that Israel faces by adversaries that want nothing less than to wipe it off the map. Together with our allies and partners, the United States defended Israel, and we helped defeat this attack.
At the same time, my Administration is working around the clock to free the hostages who have been held by Hamas for over half a year; as I have said to their families, we will not rest until we bring them home. We are also leading international efforts to deliver urgently needed humanitarian aid to Gaza and an immediate ceasefire as part of a deal that releases hostages and lays the groundwork for an enduring two-state solution.
Here at home, too many Jews live with deep pain and fear from the ferocious surge of antisemitism—in our communities; at schools, places of worship, and colleges; and across social media. These acts are despicable and echo the worst chapters of human history. They remind us that hate never goes away—it only hides until it is given oxygen. It is our shared moral responsibility to forcefully stand up to antisemitism and to make clear that hate can have no safe harbor in America.
That is why I released the first-ever United States National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and clarified the civil rights protections for Jews under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In addition, the Department of Education has launched investigations into antisemitism on college campuses, the Department of Justice is investigating and prosecuting hate crimes, and the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are focused on enhancing security in Jewish communities. We also secured the largest increase in funding ever for the physical security of nonprofits like synagogues, Jewish Community Centers, and Jewish schools. I appointed Deborah Lipstadt, a Holocaust expert, as the first-ever Ambassador-level Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism. Together, we are sending the message that, in America, evil will not win. Hate will not prevail. The venom and violence of antisemitism will not be the story of our time.
This Jewish American Heritage Month, we honor Jewish Americans, who have never given up on the promise of our Nation. We celebrate the contributions, culture, and values that they have passed down from generation to generation and that have shaped who we are as Americans. We remember that the power lies within each of us to rise together against hate, to see each other as fellow human beings, and to ensure that the Jewish community is afforded the safety, security, and dignity they deserve as they continue to shine their light in America and around the world.
Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2024 as Jewish American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the heritage and contributions of Jewish Americans and to observe this month with appropriate programs, activities, and ceremonies.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.

"May 03, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-world-press-freedom-day-8,Statement on World Press Freedom Day,"""The free press is an essential pillar of democracy, and the women and men worldwide who uphold it do vital work. Journalists go to great lengths to expose corruption, document wars and other urgent world events, bring to light threats to public safety, and bring citizens the information they need to participate fully in their societies. Some journalists have given their lives to this work. Others have suffered grievous injuries or lost their freedom.
Journalism should not be a crime anywhere on Earth. On World Press Freedom Day, we honor the bravery and sacrifice of journalists and media workers around the world risking everything in pursuit of truth.
This is especially resonant today: 2023 was one of the deadliest years for journalists in recent memory. One reason for that is the war in Gaza, where far too many journalists, the vast majority of them Palestinian, have been killed. Additionally, over 300 journalists were imprisoned around the world last year, the highest number in decades. In Russia, American journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva have been imprisoned in connection with their work for the Wall Street Journal and for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. And Austin Tice is still being held hostage in Syria after nearly 12 years.
On World Press Freedom Day, the United States calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all journalists who have been put behind bars for simply doing their jobs. And we call for the protection of journalists everywhere, including during military operations. My administration will continue to support free and independent media worldwide. We have brought together a coalition of countries to counter the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware, which is often used to monitor journalists worldwide. And we're taking action to combat crimes against journalists, strengthen security for independent media outlets, and provide legal support for investigative journalists around the world.
In the coming weeks, I will be taking executive action in response to the global crackdown on press freedom, as exemplified by the wrongful detention of journalists around the world. I will declare this crackdown on press freedom a grave threat to national security and will authorize measures, including sanctions and visa bans, against those who take abusive actions to silence the press.
Journalists and media workers are an essential part of any democracy, because well-informed dissent is critical to building stronger and more successful societies. Today and every day, we recognize their courage, support their right to do their jobs, and stand with them for press freedom."""

A Proclamation
During Yom HaShoah and these days of remembrance, we mourn the six million Jews who were systematically targeted and murdered in the Holocaust, one of the darkest chapters in human history. We also mourn the Roma, Sinti, Slavs, people with disabilities, LGBTQI+ people, racial minorities, and political dissidents who were killed or endured abuse by the Nazis and their collaborators, as well as those who risked or lost their lives to protect others. We honor the memories of the victims, the courage of the survivors, and the heroism of those who stood up to the Nazis, and we recommit ourselves to making real the promise of ""Never Again.""
I often reflect on memories of sitting around our kitchen table where my father would educate my siblings and me about the horrors of the Holocaust. Entire families wiped out. Communities savagely destroyed. Survivors left with memories and traumas that will never go away—even as the tattoos etched into their skin by the Nazis fade and the number of survivors dwindles. My dad taught us that silence is complicity—a lesson I have passed down to my children and grandchildren by taking them to the Dachau concentration camp in Germany. As United States Senator, as Vice President, and now as President, I have met with many Holocaust survivors, promising them that our Nation would neither forget what they endured nor ever again stand by silently in the face of antisemitism.
The charge has never been more urgent than in the aftermath of Hamas' vicious terrorist attack on October 7th—the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. Among the 1,200 innocent people who were slaughtered and the hundreds taken hostage were elderly survivors of the Shoah, who were forced to relive the horrors they thought they had escaped decades ago. My Administration is working tirelessly to free the hostages who have been held by Hamas for over half a year—and as I have said to their families, we will not rest until we bring them home.
While Jews across the country and around the world are still coping with the trauma of that day and its aftermath, we have seen an alarming surge in antisemitism at home and abroad that resurfaces painful scars of millennia of antisemitism and hate against the Jewish people. This includes harassment and calls for violence against Jews—in our schools, in our communities, and online. This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous. Antisemitic hate speech has absolutely no place on college campuses or anywhere else in our country. As Americans, we cannot stay silent as Jews are attacked, harassed, and targeted. We must also forcefully push back attempts to ignore, deny, distort, or revise the history of Nazi atrocities during the Holocaust or Hamas' murders and other atrocities committed on October 7th—including the appalling and unforgiveable use of rape and sexual assault to terrorize and torture Jewish women and girls.
My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people and the security of Israel is ironclad. Under the first-ever National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism, my Administration is mobilizing the full force of the Federal Government to crack down on antisemitism and to ensure hate has no safe harbor in America. We clarified civil rights protections for Jews under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Department of Education is leading investigations into antisemitism on college campuses. The Department of Justice is investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is focused on delivering security resources to Jewish communities. We provided the largest-ever increase in funding for the physical security of non-profits, including synagogues, Jewish community centers, and Jewish schools. I appointed Deborah Lipstadt, a Holocaust expert, to be the first-ever Ambassador-level Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism around the world.
During these somber days of remembrance, we mourn the lives tragically stolen in the Shoah and on October 7th. As we hold the Jewish community close to our hearts, we recommit to remembering so that what happened can never be erased. Some injustices are so heinous, horrific, and grievous that they cannot be buried, no matter how hard people try. In silence, wounds deepen, but in remembrance comes healing, justice, and repair. Toward those aims, we must all forcefully act against antisemitism and all forms of hate-fueled violence. As we do, we honor the courage, strength, and resilience of the Jewish people, who have inspired the world for generations by turning pain into purpose, healing into hope, and darkness into light.
Now, Therefore, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 5 through May 12, 2024, as a week of observance of the Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week and pause to remember victims and survivors of the Holocaust.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.

JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.""	Proclamation 10747—Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust, 2024"
"May 07, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-united-states-holocaust-memorial-museums-annual-days-remembrance-ceremony,Remarks at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's Annual Days of Remembrance Ceremony,"""Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please.
Thank you, Stu Eizenstat, for that introduction, for your leadership of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. You're a true scholar and a statesman and a dear friend.
Speaker Johnson, Leader Jeffries, Members of Congress, and, especially, the survivors of the Holocaust. If my mother were here, she would look at you and say: ""God love you all. God love you all.""
Abe Foxman and all other survivors who embody absolute courage and dignity and grace are here as well.
During these sacred Days of Remembrance, we grieve. We give voice to the 6 million Jews who were systematically targeted and murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators during World War II. We honor the memory of victims, the pain of survivors, the bravery of heroes who stood up to Hitler's unspeakable evil. And we recommit to heading and heeding the lessons that [of; White House correction] one of the darkest chapters in human history, to revitalize and realize the responsibility of ""never again.""
Never again, simply translated for me, means ""never forget."" Never forget. Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story. We must keep teaching the truth. We must keep teaching our children and our grandchildren.
And the truth is, we are at risk of people not knowing the truth.
That's why, growing up, my dad taught me and my siblings about the horrors of the Shoah at our family dinner table. That's why I visited Yad Vashem with my family as a Senator, as Vice President, and as President. And that's why I took my grandchildren to Dachau, so they could see and bear witness to the perils of indifference, the complicity of silence in the face of evil that they knew was happening.
Germany, 1933. Hitler and his Nazi party rise to power by rekindling one of the world's oldest forms of prejudice and hate: anti-Semitism. His rule didn't begin with mass murder. It started slowly across economic, political, social, and cultural life: propaganda demonizing Jews; boycotts of Jewish businesses; synagogues defaced with swastikas; harassment of Jews in the street and in the schools; anti-Semitic demonstrations, pogroms, organized riots.
With the indifference of the world, Hitler knew he could expand his reign of terror by eliminating Jews from Germany, to annihilate Jews across Europe through genocide the Nazi's called the ""Final Solution""—concentration camps, gas chambers, mass shootings. By the time the war ended, 6 million Jews—one out of every three Jews in the entire world—were murdered.
This ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust; it didn't end with the Holocaust, either, or after—or even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world, and it requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness.
That hatred was brought to life on October 7 in 2023. On the sacred Jewish holiday, the terrorist group Hamas unleashed the deadliest day of the Jewish people since the Holocaust.
Driven by ancient desire to wipe out the Jewish people off the face of the Earth, over 1,200 innocent people—babies, parents, grandparents—slaughtered in their kibbutz, massacred at a music festival, brutally raped, mutilated, and sexually assaulted. Thousands more carrying wounds, bullets, and shrapnel from the memory of that terrible day they endured. Hundreds taken hostage, including survivors of the Shoah.
Now, here we are, not 75 years later, but just 7½ months later, and people are already forgetting. They're already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror, that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.
And as Jews around the world still cope with the atrocities and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of anti-Semitism in America and around the world: vicious propaganda on social media, Jews forced to keep their—hide their kippahs under baseball hats, tuck their Jewish stars into their shirts.
On college campuses, Jewish students blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class.
Anti-Semitism—anti-Semitic posters, slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's only Jewish state.
Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7, including Hamas's appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews.
It's absolutely despicable, and it must stop.
Silence—[applause]. Silence and denial can hide much, but it can erase nothing. Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous, they cannot be—[inaudible]—buried, no matter how hard people try.
In my view, a major lesson of the Holocaust is, as mentioned earlier, it's not—was not inevitable. We know hate never goes away; it only hides. And given a little oxygen, it comes out from under the rocks.
But we also know what stops hate. One thing: all of us.
The late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks described anti-Semitism as a virus that has survived and mutated over time. Together, we cannot continue to let that happen.
We have to remember our basic principles as a nation. We have an obligation—we have an obligation to learn the lessons of history so we don't surrender our future to the horrors of the past. We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone—anyone.
From the very founding—our very founding, Jewish Americans, who represented only about 2 percent of the U.S. population, have helped lead the cause of freedom for everyone in our Nation. From that experience, we know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority and the very foundation of our democracy.
So, in moments like this, we have to put these principles that we're talking about into action.
I understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world. In America, where—we respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech, to debate and disagree, to protest peacefully and make our voices heard. I understand. That's America.
But there is no place on any campus in America—any place in America—for anti-Semitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind, whether against Jews or anyone else.
Violent attacks, destroying property is not peaceful protest, it's against the law. And we are not a lawless country. We're a civil society. We uphold the rule of law.
And no one should have to hide or be brave just to be themselves.
To the Jewish community, I want you to know I see your fear, your hurt, and your pain. Let me reassure you, as your President, you are not alone. You belong. You always have, and you always will.
And my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree.
My administration is working around the clock to free remaining hostages, just as we have freed hostages already, and we will not rest until we bring them all home.
My administration, with our Second Gentleman's leadership, has launched our Nation's first National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism that's mobilizing the full force of the Federal Government to protect Jewish communities.
But we know this is not the work of government alone or Jews alone. That's why I'm calling on all Americans to stand united against anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms.
My dear friend, and he became a friend, the late Elie Wiesel, said, quote, ""One person of integrity can make a difference."" We have to remember that now more than ever.
Here in Emancipation Hall in the U.S. Capitol, among the towering statues of history, is a bronze bust of Raoul Wallenberg. Born in Sweden as a Lutheran, he was a businessman and a diplomat. While stationed in Hungary during World War II, he used diplomatic cover to hide and rescue about 100,000 Jews over a 6-month period.
Among them was a 16-year-old Jewish boy who escaped a Nazi labor camp. After the war ended, that boy received a scholarship from the Hillel Foundation to study in America. He came to New York City penniless, but determined to turn his pain into purpose, along with his wife, also a Holocaust survivor. He became a renowned economist and foreign policy thinker, eventually making his way to this very Capitol on the staff of a first-term Senator.
That Jewish refugee was Tom Lantos, and that Senator was me.
Tom and his wife Annette and their family became dear friends to me and my family. Tom would go on to become the only Holocaust survivor ever elected to Congress, where he became a leading voice on civil rights and human rights around the world.
Tom never met Raoul, who was taken prisoner by the Soviets, never to be heard from again. But through Tom's efforts, Raoul's bust is here in the Capitol. He was also given honorary U.S. citizenship, only the second person ever, after Winston Churchill. And the Holocaust Museum here in Washington is located on a roll—a road in Raoul's name.
The story of the power of a single person to put aside our differences, to see our common humanity, to stand up to hate. And it's an ancient story of resilience from immense pain, persecution to find hope, purpose, and meaning in life we try to live and share with one another. That story endures.
Let me close with this. I know these Days of Remembrance fall on difficult times. But we all do well to remember, these days also fall during the month we celebrate Jewish American heritage, a heritage that stretches from our earliest days to enrich every single part of American life today.
Great American—great Jewish American named Tom Lantos used the phrase: ""The veneer of civilization is paper thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.""
My fellow Americans, we must—we must—be those guardians. We must never rest. We must rise against hate, meet across the divide, see our common humanity.
And God bless the victims and survivors of the Shoah.
May the resilient hearts, the courageous spirit, and the eternal flame of faith of the Jewish people forever shine their light on America and around the world, pray God.
Thank you all."""
"May 11, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-reception-medina-washington,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Medina, Washington","""Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Well, welcome to the Seattle Art Museum. [Laughter] What a magnificent place you have, Kim—really, really, really. And thanks for that introduction—most of all for your friendship.
The first couple of times they helped, it was their own fault. But they know better now, and they're still helping. [Laughter] And God love you. Thank you very, very much.
And you know, I also want to thank what I consider to be the best Governor in America on environment and one of the best Governors in America overall. Mr. Governor.
Jay and the first spouse, Trudi, thank you very, very much. And I warn you—I warn you all, if you like seeing him around Washington State, don't elect me. But if you want to see him—if you don't mind leaving him—having him leave this State a little bit, elect me, because I'm going to try to grab him to get him to Washington. [Laughter] You think I'm kidding. I'm not.
And your congressional delegation. A great friend—I won't say ""old"" because she's not; I am—Maria Cantwell. Maria, where—where is she sitting? There you are.
I can't think of virtually any major issue we've ever disagreed on in all these years. I don't want to ruin your reputation. [Laughter] But it's true.
She's a significant leader. Not kidding. And you know why? When you think of Maria, you think of one thing: integrity. No one ever doubts that whatever she says, she means, and she's telling you the truth. Maria, I love you, kid. You're really—you're the best.
And Suzan DelBene, who is working like hell to make everything work. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. She's putting together a real, real effort running the DNC [DCCC; White House correction]. I mean—anyway, thank you for all you're doing.
And a woman who has more courage and hutzpah and stamina than anybody I know, Representative Jayapal. Thank you.
Adam Smith. Kim Schuler [Schrier; White House correction]. And Marilyn—where's Marilyn—where's Marilyn Strickland? There you go. Marilyn, thank you very much.
Just what you all need: You finally get to come home on a magnificent Saturday, and you're all in here with me. [Laughter] Please forgive me. [Laughter]
Look, before I begin, let me answer a question related to the hostage deal I get—keep getting asked by the press and all the folks out there.
You know, there would be a cease-fire tomorrow if Hamas would release the hostages—the women and the elderly and the wounded. Israel said it's up to Hamas; if they wanted to do it, we could end it tomorrow. And the cease-fire would begin tomorrow. It all has to do—you know, we've not—anyway, I don't want to—I guess I shouldn't get into all this about Israel. But you know—well, I don't want to get going, I guess. [Laughter]
But look, I want to thank you for your support and—for this campaign, especially Brad and Kathy Smith. Brad, you've been—we were—where—there you are. We were recently in another part of the world—in Wisconsin doing an incredible job.
And Microsoft is investing $3 billion to build a data center in Racine to power their artificial intelligence system. It's being built on the same site that Trump promised FoxComm would build a $10 billion manufacturing center. Trump even showed up at the groundbreaking with, literally, a golden shovel—[laughter]—promising this would be the, quote, ""eighth wonder of the world.""
Give me a break. Anyway—[laughter]—and he dug this hole with the golden shovel, and then he fell into it. [Laughter] He just keeps digging and digging more holes.
Folks, look, in fact, we feel good about the—the state of the race. But you know, we know the race is close.
The last four national polls have me ahead in two, him ahead in one, tied in—for another. In the battleground States, most of the polls released this week are within the margin of error. We just had the very strong Wisconsin poll up 6 points.
But look, here are a few things we find encouraging. And the polls are very difficult now. As some of you know, in your businesses you use polling, it's very difficult to get an accurate poll because not everybody has a landline. It takes x thousand calls—not really, but scores of calls to get one response.
But what I look at—and if you take a look at '20, '22, '23, all those races, you look at the—what the outcome of the primaries were.
First, we run strongest among likely voters in the polling data. That's a good sign. And while the national polls basically have us registered voters up by 4, likely voters we're up by more.
The second point I'd like to make is, the actual votes in the primaries, as opposed to the polls, we're running much stronger than Trump.
Trump continues to lose a gigantic chunk of his Republican colleagues. Just this last week, over 120,000 people voted for a woman who dropped out of the race, Nikki Haley, in the Indiana primary—a hundred twenty thousand—in Pennsylvania primary, she was already out of the race and over 150,000 people voted for her in that race.
In the Pennsylvania primary, I got over 100,000 more votes in the Democratic primary than Trump did in the Republican primary. I got 900,000 votes. Trump, a little under 800,000.
I know a lot of people like to look at the polls, but I look at the actual votes as we—for—and if you look at a guide from '18, '20, '22, '23, and those off-year elections, it comes down to that.
Let me say there's always going to be a place for Haley voters for my campaign. [Laughter]
And—anyway, I won't get into what I'm predicting. But anyway—look, third, we're building the strongest ground game for any campaign in our country's history.
So far, 1.6 million individuals have contributed to our campaign—1.6 million individuals. We've raised more money than any candidate has at this spot in the campaign. And of those 1.6 million, over 97 percent contributed less than $200. They're on payment plans of $5, $10, $20, $30, $50 a month. That's how we're raising that money.
And as the candidates know here, if you want to know what's happening in the street, see what ordinary people are doing with their money.
The battleground States, we've opened up more than 150 field offices, while Trump has not opened a single, solitary one. We're organizing, and we're ready. Trump MAGA Republicans are in significant disarray.
Now let's get to the message of the campaign. Our message is straightforward. There's a lot to talk about. But the threat posed—that Trump poses to democracy is greater than what he posed in the first term.
It's clear that when we lost the—when he lost in 2020, something snapped in him. And I mean it sincerely. A lot of people known him well when he was in New York. But some—[inaudible]—he just can't accept the fact he's lost, and he's lost it when he lost. He really did.
That's why January 6, every legal avenue Trump tried to change the election failed, so he unleashed an insurrection. And he did unleash the insurrection. Now he's running again.
He's not only obsessed with the losing in 2020, he's clearly unhinged. Just listen to what he's telling people. I urge you to get TIME magazine. He's on the cover of TIME. He did a long, long interview. And he means when he says.
In the article, he said, ""A lot of people liked it when I said I'll be a dictator on day one."" I don't know—asked if he would—there would be violence occur if he lost, he said, ""Well, it depends."" ""It depends"" about whether there'd be a violent—he calls insurrectionists who are in prison—he calls them ""patriots."" ""Patriots."" And if reelected, he wants ""every one"" of them pardoned—""every one"" of them pardoned.
Trump says, when he loses again, that there'll be a ""bloodbath"" if that occurs. These are his words, not mine. His words.
You know, he said he's not going to accept the results of the election when he loses again. And it's clear—it's clear a lot of people—a lot of people are—how can I say it?—auditioning for Vice President, which is not unusual. But he has a litmus test. They have to say they won't accept the results—that they didn't accept the results of the 2020 election, and when they lose again, they'll not accept the results of the 2024 election.
This is not some dictator state. What's going on? I really mean it. Have you ever, ever—even if you're as old as I am—[laughter]—have you ever heard anything like that in American politics?
And look at what he's saying about reproductive freedom. He's bragging he's the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned. Listen to what he said in TIME magazine. He said, ""The States should monitor women's pregnancies""—""monitor them,"" not just—know—""monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who seek help."" Monitor women's pregnancies? Prosecute them?
Folks, Trump is running—he's not running to lead America, he's running for revenge. He talks about it. ""I'll be your revenge"" —""I will be your revenge."" ""I will be your retribution.""
That's revenge. Every—but—but revenge in no ways lead—to lead the county. And you can't. You can't build a future on revenge. You can't build better lives for people on revenge. That's why I'm not running on revenge, I'm running to lead America into the future, folks.
Look at the progress we've made: 15 million votes—excuse me, new jobs since we got elected—15 million. More than any President has in that period of time in American history. More have health insurance today in America than any time in American history.
We took on Big Pharma, and we won, lowering prescription drug costs. Everybody knows somebody with insulin—needing insulin or other major drugs they need.
Well, insulin was 400 bucks a month, now it's $35 a month, and people are able to afford it, saving lives. But what people don't also—what we don't talk about enough is not only is it saving lives, it's saving the taxpayer $160 billion—$160 billion—because Medicare doesn't have to pay out that $400 and exorbitant prices.
I'm proud to say the new report co-released by 20 major climate organizations—and by the way, I'm not—I'll say it again: Your Governor is one of the leaders in the Nation and the world on climate change—climate organizations, from the Sierra Club to the Sunrise Movement, credited my administration with taking on more than 300 actions relating to conservation, climate, public health, and clean energy. And the Indian Nations are stepping up. And we're keeping our promise to them as well.
You know, in the words of that—the endorsement, it says, ""Biden has done more to take action to protect the environment, to protect and secure health and the—our environment than any president in American history, and he's not done yet.""
Well, we're not done yet. We've got a long way to go. But we're on a path to be able to get it done. And we've also made the most significant investments in science, technology, innovation in generations—so that many of you are leading the way.
Talking about science and development to you guys is like talking about, you know, football to the Philadelphia Eagles. [Laughter] I'm an Eagles fan.
But all kidding aside, we've already attracted six—$866 billion—$866 billion in private sector investment in clean energy, manufacturing, and historic amounts in—in such short amount of period. And we're just getting started. And you all know it.
I just signed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. We're not going to stop until we once again—I miss her; Dianne Feinstein helped me get passed, when I was a Senator, the assault weapons ban. We need to get that again. It saved lives. It will save lives.
And I promise you, elect a Democratic Congress and Kamala and I will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again.
I promise I'm not going to keep you much longer. But, folks, we're lowering costs, expanding opportunities, and protecting freedoms. And we have to keep it going.
For example, Trump is determined to get rid of my climate law. He just flat out said it in that—read that article. He said he wants to get rid of the climate law because the oil companies hate it. He said he wants to ""drill, drill, drill.""
In fact, he's been reported—he asked—[inaudible]—on television the other day—Big Oil companies—he met with the oil execs—to direct a billion dollars toward his campaign, and we'd have ourselves ""a deal,"" he said. Look, what's the deal?
He'd repeal everything we've done on climate—as he said in the TIME—in the TIME's article, again, ""Drill, drill, drill.""
Folks, look, let me close with this. Our freedoms and our very democracy are at stake. And that's not hyperbole. I mean it. I give you my word. I mean it from the bottom of my heart. We know it.
I do an awful lot of international—as you might expect. But because that's been my—my, sort of, go-to job when I was in the Senate and when I was Vice President. And I know all these heads of state, knew them before, and know the ones that are there now.
I attend all these meetings, these international conclaves with heads of state. And as I leave those meetings—not a—this is not a exaggeration—half of the CEOs—half of these CEOs—half of the heads of state will come up and grab my arm and say, ""You can't let him win. My""—meaning their—""My democracy is at stake.""
This is the guy who says, ""Let them""—whether it's you're talking about the Middle East or you're talking about Europe, ""If you don't pay enough money for your own defense, go ahead, you can take the country.""
Look, this is why I need you. I know we can do this together. I've never been more optimistic about our future. We just have to remember who the hell we are. We're the United States of America. We're the only country—in my view, as a student of history—the only country that's come out of every crisis we've entered stronger than we went in—literally, not figuratively, stronger than we went in.
And we have—and think about this. Madeleine Albright wrote about us being the essential nation. Not because I'm President; because no matter—who leads the world in the right direction if America is not the leader? Seriously, who replaces America in that role?
And he has no notion of it. And he doesn't seem to care much about it. And so that's why other nations are worried about their democratic future, whether it's Europe, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's the Far East, whether it's Japan, no matter where it is.
And so there's a lot at stake. The world's looking at us. I'm going to try my best not to let you down, because we have the greatest democracy in history of the world.
We're the only democracy—we're the only country in the whole world that's built on an idea. Every other nation in the world was built on geography, ethnicity, religion, something that unites them. But we're the only one built on an idea. And the idea—and it's not hyperbole—the idea is, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal, endowed by""—we've never lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it.
This guy is ready to walk away from it. It's not who we are. Not only does the American public need us to do the right thing, but the world needs us to do the right thing. And I'll try my best not to disappoint you. Thank you.""	Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Medina, Washington"

Thank you, thank you, thank you. Now, I assume you're standing in case you have to run when the rain starts. [Laughter] Please, have a seat.
Rox, thank you very much for all you do to fight for American steelworkers. I mean that sincerely.
I—and I want to recognize all the labor unions here today, including Steelworkers, Auto Workers, Sheet Metal Workers, AFL-CIO, IBEW, Communications Workers, Boilermakers, Machinists.
I'm proud, as Rox said, to be labeled the most pro-union President in American history. You heard me say it before: Wall Street is important, lot of good folks there, but they didn't build America. The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class.
Folks, leaders from key American industries are here as well, including steel, aluminum, solar, semiconductors, automakers.
And members of my Cabinet are here as well: Janet Yellen—the front row is ""murderers' row"" here—[laughter]—the Treasury Department; Julie Su, our Trade—our—of Labor; and Katherine Tai, our Nation's Trade Representative.
And outstanding Members of Congress as well. From Michigan, Debbie Stabenow is here. Debbie, welcome. And Haley Stevens is here. No, I guess she—there you are. Oh, you did make it. They told me you might not be able to make it. I'm sorry.
Representative Haley M. Stevens. I'm here. [Inaudible]
The President. All right.
And Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. Again, you—smile, Debbie, it's okay. [Laughter]
Representative Deborah A. Dingell. I am. I'm happy.
The President. Elissa Slotkin—well, you should be. [Laughter] You—you're responsible for a lot of this.
Thank you for joining us as I announce a series of actions to make sure American workers and American business and corporations can compete and win in the industries of the future, because that's what this is about.
The fact is that American workers are—can outwork and outcompete anyone, as long as the competition is fair. But for too long, it hasn't been fair.
For years, the Chinese Government has poured state money into Chinese companies across a whole range of industries: steel and aluminum, semiconductors, electric vehicles, solar panels—the industries of the future—and even critical health equipment, like gloves and masks.
China heavily subsidized all these products, pushing Chinese companies to produce far more than the rest of the world can absorb. And then dumping the excess products onto the market at unfairly low prices, driving other manufacturers around the world out of business.
You know, we—I won't go into it, but we were talking today about how many aluminum plants there used to be and how many there are now.
The price is unfairly low because Chinese companies don't need to worry about a profit because the Chinese Government subsidized them and subsidized them heavily.
And the Chinese relies on other anticompetitive tactics as well, like forcing the American companies to transfer their technology in order to do business in China.
I've spent a lot of time with Xi Jinping. Early on, I told him—he said, why am I being unfair with China? [Inaudible]—unfair. I said: ""Look, we'll play by the same rules if you want. If you want to do business in China, you've got to have a 51-percent Chinese owner, you've got to provide access to all your intellectual property, et cetera. You want to do that in America?"" There was silence.
Sometimes they just outright steal through cyber espionage and other means. And it's been a—well documented and internationally recognized.
When you make tactics like these, they are—they're—you're not competing. It's not competition, it's cheating. And we've seen the damage here in America.
To name one example, back in 2000, when cheap steel from China began to flood the market, U.S. steel towns across Pennsylvania and Ohio were hit hard. And any of you from those areas know well. More than 1,800 [18,000; White House correction] ironworkers and steelworkers in Pennsylvania and Ohio lost their jobs.
I'm not going to let that happen again. That's why today I'm announcing new tariffs in key sectors of the economy that are going to ensure that our workers are not held back by unfair trade practices.
They include a thing I'm announcing today: 25-percent tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum products. And we'll counter China's overcapacity in these industries.
And we're making major investments in clean American steel and aluminum—clean American steel and aluminum. It's a big deal. Clean because of the way we manufacture it here—it emits half as much carbon as steel made in China.
Last month, my administration announced the largest investment in clean manufacturing in all of history, up to $1.5 billion in six clean steel projects across America, creating and supporting thousands—thousands—of union jobs.
Next, a 100-percent tariff on electric vehicles made in China. And people say, ""Wow."" [Applause] Because we're not going to let China flood our market, making it impossible for American automakers—automobile—auto manufacturers to compete fairly.
We're also implementing a 25-percent tariff on electric vehicle batteries from China and a 25-percent tariff on the critical minerals that make those batteries.
Folks, look, I'm determined that the future of electric vehicles will be made in America by union workers. Period. And we'll do it by following international trade laws to do it.
American companies are investing tens of billions of dollars in electric vehicles and batteries. And thanks to my bipartisan infrastructure law, we're building a network of 500,000 charging stations all across America, creating thousands—thousands—of IBEW jobs across America. Electric charging stations—[applause]—and the reason to do this is simple: Electric charging stations have to be as easy to find as a gas station, and that's what this will be. You're not going to have to worry about—you're taking off, and you're going to be able to make it all across the country in one—without having to figure something else out.
Our partners around the world are making similar investments. They also want a supply chain for electric vehicles that isn't dominated by unfair trade practices from China.
America can continue to buy—Americans—I want to make this clear, notwithstanding what the other guy is saying—can buy any kind of car they want, whether it's gas, electric, or hybrid, but we're never going to allow China to unfairly control the market for these cars. Period.
Next, we're going to raise tariffs on Chinese solar panels from 25 to 50 percent. Here, again, because the Chinese Government is subsidizing excess capacity, they're flooding the market. They're driving manufacturing companies out of business in Europe. But we won't let that happen here in America.
We're putting a 50-percent tariff on semiconductors made in China. These are those tiny computer—all of you know this, but for the public—those little, tiny computer chips, smaller than a fingertip, that power our everyday lives, everything from smartphones to automobiles to dishwashers, satellites.
Look, America invented these cheeps [chips; White House correction]. But, over time, we stopped making them. We invested other—overseas. Now, thanks to my CHIPS and Science Act, one of the most significant investments ever in science and technology, we're bringing this vital industry back home where it started, in the United States of America.
And finally, we're putting tariffs on health equipment, like masks and gloves that nurses and doctors wear every single day. If the pandemic caught us any—taught us anything, we need to have a secure supply of essential supplies here at home.
Folks, these key sectors, my administration is combining investments in America with tariffs that are strategic and targeted. It's a smart approach.
Compare that to the prior—what the prior administration did. The—my predecessor promised to increase American exports and boost manufacturing. But he did neither. He failed. He signed a trade deal with China. They were supposed to buy $200 billion more in American goods. Instead, China imports from America barely budged.
And now Trump and his MAGA Republicans want across-the-board tariffs on all imports from all countries, if reelected. Well, that would drive up costs for families on an average of $1,500 per year each year. He simply doesn't get it.
For years, I've heard many Republicans and even Democratic friends say, ""China is not on the rise""—excuse me, ""China is on the rise; America is falling behind."" I've always believed they got it wrong.
America is rising. We have the best economy in the world. And since I've come into office, the GDP is up, our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest level in over a decade, and we're standing up against Chinese Government unfair economic practices now.
At the same time, we're standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. I've revitalized our partnerships with the Pacific allies in India, Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines—Pacific Island nations.
I've made sure the most advanced American technologies we develop or invent can be used by the China—can't be used by the Chinese Government to undermine our national security.
Frankly—before it rains—frankly, for all this tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that.
Bottom line: I want fair competition with China, not conflict. And we're in a stronger position to win that economic competition of the 21st century against China than anyone else because we're investing in America again, in American workers.
Let me close—let me close with this. I come from Scranton, a town like a lot of working class, middle class neighborhoods all across America—like Racine, Wisconsin, which I visited last week. Once a manufacturing boomtown until trickle-down economics came along, and the middle class in Racine got hollowed out.
Six years ago, my predecessor showed up carrying a golden shovel, promising, thanks to his new $10 billion, manufacturing complex would be built in Racine. He said it would be the eighth wonder of the world, big promises that never came true. He used that golden shovel to dig a hole, and then he fell into it. [Laughter]
Well, that's not on my—that's not part of my—well, I'm delivering for Racine—delivering. Thanks to the investment of my administration, Microsoft is investing billions to build a new data center in Racine, creating thousands of good-paying jobs.
Because the view from Scranton and towns like it are a lot different than from Mar-a-Lago. It's the view where—that money doesn't determine your worth, everyone is entitled to being treated with dignity and respect, and everyone deserves a fair shot. We leave nobody behind.
That's the America we're building together. That's why I've never been more optimistic about our future. And I'm really going fast because of the rain.
We have—[laughter]—that's why we have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there is nothing—there is nothing—beyond our capacity when we do it together.
God bless you all. And better get out of the rain.
Thank you very, very much.
Thank you.
Oh, we've got to sign this.
[At this point, the President moved to the signing desk.]
Q. Mr. President, why wait 3 years for the tariffs?

Well, hello, everyone. Welcome to the Cabinet Room. Welcome. And it's great to see you all.
We've got some important meeting and business to do in a minute. But I do want to kick it off with one comment: Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
You know, first, I want to thank you for your leadership. I know it's—I may not look it, but I've seen it for a while. I've been around—I know I don't look like I've been around very long. [Laughter] I know that part. But never before have I seen the Nation ask so much of our military in so many parts of the world at the same time.
In Europe, you're equipping and training Ukrainian troops as they defend their freedom against Russia's vicious onslaught.
In Africa, you're working with our partners to take terrorists off the battlefield.
In the Indo-Pacific, you're building on alliances with Australia, Philippines, Japan, and Republic of Korea and improving our relationship with India as well and putting our Nation in the strongest position we can possibly be in.
In the Middle East, you have stepped up to defend against a range of unprecedented attacks on U.S. Forces, Israel, and our partners across the region.
And I look forward to discussing—I think you've been remarkable. I look forward to discussing all these issues this afternoon.
Next, I want to thank you for your commitment. I know last year hasn't been easy. I know, as you've faced crisis abroad, you've also faced unnecessary chaos here at home: polarized politics, which I'm sure doesn't confuse you at all, but it does me sometimes; and potential shutdowns, performative stunts that impact on morale and readiness and too many military families.
But you keep going. And you keep showing every person, with the most heart to serve, you're made up of an incredible group of men and women. And I know I've said it before, but I mean it—I don't think there's any comparable counterargument—you're the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen. And that's a fact.
And you know, I've had a vow since I've been a young Senator, and that is that, you know, we have a lot of obligations, but only one—only one—overwhelming obligation: to prepare those we send into harm's way with all they need and to take care of them and their families when they come home and when they don't come home.
And you've made progress on this front as well, over the last year, in particular.
I'm proud that, for the first time in nearly a decade, rates of sexual assault and harassment are—within Active Duty forces are down. They're down. And that's because of your leadership.
And finally, as I said a moment ago, I know I've asked a lot of you, but—and everyone in this room, but I have one more request: Please pass along my deepest thanks to all the service men and women under your control and under your charge. And I really mean it.
Right now all across the world, we're defending our Nation—they're defending it. And every day, they're risking their own safety for the safety of their fellow citizens.
So this afternoon I look forward to discussing a whole range of things and how I can continue to help support your needs and what you're doing for us.
So I want to thank you again for being here. And I'm going to ask the press to leave, and we get down to business.
Thank you.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, President Thomas, faculty, staff, alumni. And a special thanks: I'll ask all the folks who helped you get here—your mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers—all those who got you here, all the way in the back, please, parents, grandparents, all who helped, stand up, because we owe you a debt of gratitude. To all the family.
And that is not hyperbole. A lot of you, like my family, had to make significant sacrifices to get your kids to school. It mattered. It's mattered a lot.
And the friends of Morehouse and the Morehouse Men of the class of 2024.
I've got more Morehouse Men in the White House telling me what to do than I know what to do. [Laughter] You all think I'm kidding, don't you? [Laughter] You know I'm not. And it's the best thing that's happened to me.
Scripture says, ""The prayers of a righteous man availeth much."" In Augusta, Georgia, a righteous man once enslaved set foot for freedom. The story goes, he feared no evil; he walked through the valley of the shadow of death on his way north to free soil in Philadelphia. A Baptist minister, he walked with faith in his soul, powering the steps of his feet to glory.
But after the Union won the war, he knew his prayers availed him freedom that was not his alone. And so this righteous man, Richard Coulter, returned home, his feet weary, his spirit in no ways tired.
A hundred and fifty-seven years ago—you all know the story, but the rest of the world doesn't, and it should—in the basement of a Baptist church in Augusta, he and two other ministers, William Jefferson White and Edmund Turney, planted the seeds of something revolutionary—and it was at the time—a school: a school to help formerly enslaved men enter the ministry, where education would be the great equalizer from slavery to freedom, an institution of higher learning that would become Morehouse College.
I don't know any other college in America that has that tradition and that consequence.
To the class of 2024, you join, as you know, a sacred tradition. An education makes you free. And Morehouse education makes you fearless. I mean it. Visionary. Exceptional. Congratulations. You are Morehouse Men. God love you.
And, again, I thank your families and your friends who helped you get here, because they made sacrifices for you as well.
This graduation day is a day for generations, a day of joy, a day earned, not given.
We gather on this Sunday morning because—if we were in church, perhaps there would be this reflection. There would be a reflection about Resurrection and redemption. Remember, Jesus was buried on Friday, and it was Sunday—on Sunday he rose again. But—but—we don't talk enough about Saturday, when the disciples—his disciples felt all hope was lost.
In our lives and the lives of the Nation, we have those Saturdays, to bear witness the day before glory, seeing people's pain and not looking away. But what work is done on Saturday to move pain to purpose? How can faith get a man, get a nation through what was to come?
Here's what my faith has taught me.
I was the first Biden to ever graduate from college, taking out loans with my dad and my—all through school to get me there. My junior year spring break, I fell in love at first sight, literally, with a woman I adored. I graduated from law school in her hometown, and I got married and took a job at a law firm in my hometown, Wilmington, Delaware. But then everything changed.
One of my heroes—and he was my hero—a Baptist minister, a Morehouse Man, Dr. Martin Luther King—in April of my law school graduation year, he was murdered. My city of Wilmington—and we were a—to our great shame, a slave State, and we were segregated. Delaware erupted into flames when he was assassinated, literally.
We're the only city in America where the National Guard patrolled every street corner for 9 full months with drawn bayonets, the longest stretch in any American city since the Civil War.
Dr. King's legacy had a profound impact on me and my generation, whether you're Black or White. I left the fancy law firm I had just joined and decided to become a public defender and then a county councilman, working to change our State's politics to embrace the cause of civil rights.
The Democratic Party in Delaware was a Southern Democratic Party at the time. We wanted to change it to become a Northeastern Democratic Party.
Then, we were trying to get someone to run for the United States Senate the year Nixon ran. I was 29 years of age. I had no notion of running—I love reading about everybody knew I was going to run; I didn't know I was going to run—[laughter]—when a group of senior members of the Democratic Party came to me. They couldn't find anybody to run and said, ""You should run.""
Nixon won my State by 60 percent of the vote. We won by 3,100 votes. We won by the thinnest of margins, but with a broad coalition, including students from the best HBCU in America, Delaware State University. You guys are good, but—[laughter]—they got me elected. All you all think I'm kidding. [Laughter] I'm not kidding.
But, by Christmas, I was a newly elected Senator hiring staff in Washington, DC, when I got a call from the first responders, my fire department in my hometown, that forever altered my life. They put a young woman first responder on the line to say: ""There was an automobile accident. A tractor-trailer hit your wife's car while she was Christmas shopping with your three children."" And she—poor woman, she just blurted out. She said, ""Your wife and daughter are killed""—my 13-month-old daughter—""they're dead, and your almost 3-year-old and 4-year-old sons are badly injured. We're not sure they're going to make it either.""
I rushed from Washington to their bedside. I wanted to pray, but I was so angry. I was angry at God. I was angry at the world.
I had the same pain 43 years later when that 4-year-old boy who survived was a grown man and a father himself, laying in another hospital bed at Walter Reed hospital having contracted stage-4 glioblastoma because he was a year in Iraq as a major—he won the Bronze Star—living next to a burn pit. Cancer took his last breath.
On this walk of life, you can understand—you come to understand that we don't know where or what fate will bring you or when. But we also know we don't walk alone. When you've been a beneficiary of the compassion of your family, your friends, even strangers, you know how much the compassion matters. I've learned there is no easy optimism, but by faith—by faith—we can find redemption.
I was a single father for 5 years. No man deserves one great love, let alone two. My youngest brother, who was a hell of an athlete, did a great thing. He introduced me to a classmate of his and said, ""You'll love her; she doesn't like politics."" [Laughter] But all kidding aside, until I met Jill, who healed—who healed—the family in all the broken places. Our family became my redemption.
Many of you have gone through similar or worse—and even worse things. But you lean on others, they lean on you, and together, you keep the faith in a better day tomorrow. But it's not easy.
I know 4 years ago, as some of your speakers have already mentioned, it felt like one of those Saturdays. The pandemic robbed you of so much. Some of you lost loved ones—mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, who were—aren't able to be here to celebrate with you today. You missed your high school graduation. You started college just as George Floyd was murdered and there was a reckoning on race.
It's natural to wonder if democracy you hear about actually works for you. What is democracy if Black men are being killed in the street? What is democracy if a trail of broken promises still leave Black communities behind? What is democracy if you have to be 10 times better than anyone else to get a fair shot?
And most of all, what does it mean, as we've heard before, to be a Black man who loves his country even if it doesn't love him back in equal measure?
When I sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, in front of the fireplace across from my desk, I have two busts: one of Dr. King and one of Bobby Kennedy. I often find myself looking at those busts and making decisions. I ask myself: Are we living up to what we say we are as a nation, to end racism and poverty, to deliver jobs and justice, to restore our leadership in the world?
Then I look down and see the rosary on my wrist that was that of my late son, he had on him when he died at Walter Reed and I was with him. And I ask myself: What would he say? I know the answer because he told me in his last days.
My son knew the days were numbered. The last conversation was: ""Dad, I'm not afraid, but I'm worried. I'm worried you're going to give up when I go. You're going to give up.""
We have an expression in the Biden family. When you want someone to know—give you their word, you say, ""Look at me."" He was lying—to me, he said: ""Look at me, Dad. Look at me."" He said: ""Give me your word. Give me your word as my father that you will not quit, that you will stay engaged. Promise me, Dad. Stay engaged. Promise me. Promise me.""
I wrote a book called ""Promise Me, Dad,"" not for the public at large, although a lot of people would end up buying it. It's for my grandchildren and great-grandchildren to know who Beau Biden was.
The rosary on the—my wrist, the bust in my office remind me that faith asks you to hold on to hope, to move heaven and earth to make better days. Well, that's my commitment to you: to show you democracy, democracy, democracy is still the way.
If Black men are being killed on the streets, we bear witness. For me, that means to call out the poison of White supremacy, to root out systemic racism. I stood up for George—with George Floyd's family to help create a country where you don't need to have that talk with your son or grandson as they get pulled over.
Instead of a trail of broken promises, we're investing more money than ever in Black families and Black communities. We're reconnecting Black neighborhoods cut off by old highways and decades of disinvestment where no one cared about the community.
We've delivered checks in pockets to reduce child—Black child poverty to the lowest rate in history. We're removing every lead pipe in America so every child can drink clean water without fear of brain damage, and they can't afford to remove the lead pipes themselves. We're delivering affordable high-speed internet so no child has to sit in their parents' car or do their homework in a parking lot outside of McDonald's.
Instead of forcing you to prove you're 10 times better, we're breaking down doors so you have a hundred times more opportunities: good-paying jobs you can raise a family on in your neighborhood; capital to start small business and loans to buy homes; health insurance, prescriptions drugs, housing that's more affordable and accessible.
I've walked the picket line and defended the rights of workers. I'm relieving the burden of student debt—many of you have already had the benefit of it—[applause]—so I [you; White House correction] can chase your dreams and grow the economy. When the Supreme Court told me I couldn't, I found two other ways to do it. And we were able to do it, because it grows the economy.
And I—in addition to the original $7 billion investment in HBCUs, I'm investing 16 billion more dollars—[applause]—more in our history, because you're vital to our Nation. Most HBCUs don't have the endowments. The jobs of the future require sophisticated laboratories, sophisticated opportunity on campus.
We're opening doors so you can walk into a life of generational wealth, to be providers and leaders for your families and communities. Today, record numbers of Black Americans have jobs, health insurance, and more [wealth; White House correction] than ever.
Democracy is also about hearing and heeding your generation's call to a community free of gun violence and a planet free of climate crisis and showing your power to change the world.
But I also know some of you ask: What is democracy if we can't stop wars that break out and break our hearts? In a democracy, we debate and dissent about America's role in the world.
I want to say this very clearly. I support peaceful, nonviolent protest. Your voices should be heard, and I promise you I hear them. I determined to make my administration look like America. I have more African Americans in high places, including on the Court, than any President in American history—[applause]—because I need the input.
What's happening in Gaza and Israel is heartbreaking. Hamas's vicious attack on Israel, killing innocent lives and holding people hostage. I was there 9 days after, seen pictures of tying a mother and a daughter with a rope, pouring kerosene on them, burning them and watching as they died. Innocent Palestinians caught in the middle of all this: men, women, and children killed or displaced in despite—in desperate need of water, food, and medicine. It's a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
That's why I've called for an immediate cease-fire—an immediate cease-fire—to stop the fighting—[applause]—bring the hostages home. And I've been working on a deal as we speak, working around the clock to lead an international effort to get more aid into Gaza, rebuild Gaza.
I'm also working around the clock for more than just one cease-fire. I'm working to bring the region together. I'm working to build a lasting, durable peace. Because the question is, as you see what's going on in Israel today: What after? What after Hamas? What happens then? What happens in Gaza? What rights do the Palestinian people have? I'm working to make sure we finally get a two-state solution—the only solution—[applause]—for two people to live in peace, security, and dignity.
This is one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world. And there's nothing easy about it. I know it angered and frustrates many of you, including my family. But most of all, I know it breaks your heart. It breaks mine as well.
Leadership is about fighting through the most intractable problems. It's about challenging anger, frustration, and heartbreak to find a solution. It's about doing what you believe is right, even when it's hard and lonely.
You're all future leaders, every one of you graduating today. And that's not hyperbole. You're future leaders, all of you. You'll face complicated, tough moments. In these moments, you'll listen to others, but you'll have to decide, guided by knowledge, conviction, principle, and your own moral compass.
And the desire to know what freedom is, what it can be is the heart and soul of why this college was founded in the first place, proving that a free nation is born in the hearts of men spellbound by freedom. But the—that's the magic of Morehouse. That's the magic of America.
But let's be clear: What happens to you and your family when old ghosts in new garments seize power, extremists come for the freedoms you thought belonged to you and everyone?
Today in Georgia, they won't allow water to be available to you while you wait in line to vote in an election. What in the hell is that all about? I'm serious. Think about it. And then the constant attacks on Black election workers who count your vote.
Insurrectionists who storm the Capitol with Confederate flags are called ""patriots"" by some. Not in my house. Black police officers, Black veterans protecting the Capitol were called another word, as you'll recall.
They also say out loud, these other groups, immigrants ""poison the blood"" of our country, like the Grand Wizard and Fascists said in the past. But you know and I know we all bleed the same color. In America, we're all created equal.
Extremists close the doors of opportunity; strike down affirmative action; attack the values of diversity, equality, and inclusion.
I never thought when I was graduating in 1968—as your honoree just was—we talked about—I never thought I'd be in—present in a time when there's a national effort to ban books—not to write history, but to erase history.
They don't see you in the future of America. But they're wrong. To me, we make history, not erase it. We know Black history is American history. Many of you graduates don't know me, but check my record, you'll know what I'm saying, I mean from my gut. And we know Black men are going to help us, lead us to the future, Black men from this class, in this university.
But, graduates, this is what we're up against: extremist forces aligned against the meaning and message of Morehouse. And they peddle a fiction, a caricature of what being a man is about: tough talk, abusing power, bigotry. Their idea of being a man is toxic. I ran into them all the time when I was younger. They got—all right, I don't want to get started. [Laughter]
But that's not you. It's not us. You all know and demonstrate what it really means to be a man. Being a man is about the strength of respect and dignity. It's about showing up because it's too late if you have to ask. It's about giving hate no safe harbor and leaving no one behind and defending freedoms. It's about standing up to the abuse of power, whether physical, economic, or psychological. It's about knowing faith without works is dead.
Look—and you're doing the work. Today I look out at all you graduates and I see the next generation of Morehouse Men who are doctors and researchers curing cancer; artists shaping our culture; fearless journalists and intellectuals challenging convention. I see preachers and advocates who might even join another Morehouse Man in the United States Senate.
You can clap for him. He's a good man. [Applause]
As I said, I'm proud to have the most diverse administration in history to tap into the full talents of our Nation. I'm also proud of putting the first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court. And I have no doubt, one day a Morehouse Man will be on that Court as well. [Applause] Well, you know it.
I've been Vice President to the first Black President and become my close friend and President to the first woman Vice President. Why—I have no idea—no doubt that a Morehouse Man will be President one day, just after an AKA from Howard. [Laughter] She's tough, guys. [Laughter]
Look, let me close with this. I know I don't look like I've been around very long. [Laughter]
[At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.]
But in my career, for the first 30 years, I was told, ""You're too young, kid."" They used to stop me from getting on the Senate elevator when I first got there, for real. And now I'm too old. Whether you're young or old, I know what endures: The strength and wisdom of faith endures. And I hope—my hope for you is—my challenge to you is that you still keep the faith so long as you can.
That cap on your head proves you've earned your crown. The question is now, 25 years from now, 50 years from now, when you're asked to stand and address the next generation of Morehouse Men, what will you say you did with that power you've earned? What will you say you've done for your family, for your community, your country when it mattered most?
I know what we can do. Together, we're capable of building a democracy worthy of our dreams; a future where every—even more of your brothers and sisters can follow their dreams; a boundless future where your legacies lift us up to sow—those who follow; a bigger, brighter future that proves the American Dream is big enough for everyone to succeed.
Class of 2024, 4 years ago, it felt probably like Saturday. Four years later, you made it to Sunday, to commencement, to the beginning. And with faith and determination, you can push the sun above the horizon once more. You can reveal a light hope—and that's not—I'm not kidding—for yourself and for your nation.
""The prayers of a righteous man availeth much."" A righteous man. A good man. A Morehouse Man.
God bless you all. We're expecting a lot from you.
Thank you.""	Commencement Address at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia"

"May 20, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-jewish-american-heritage-month-celebration-0,Remarks at a Jewish American Heritage Month Celebration,"""Second Gentleman Douglas C. Emhoff. I've got to wait for that song to end. [Laughter]
Good evening.
Audience members. Good evening.
Second Gentleman Emhoff. It is my honor to be standing here with President Biden and Vice President Harris. They have both stood strong with the Jewish community time and time again. There is no one fighting harder to combat hate and to unite our country.
To all of our esteemed guests, it is so great to join you for a Jewish American Heritage Month celebration at the White House.
Tonight we've come together to celebrate our heritage and honor our culture, to reflect on the invaluable contributions of our ancestors and the Jewish leaders of today.
But it is also a challenging time for our community. It's been a dark and difficult 7 months. I know a lot of us are feeling alone, afraid, and in pain.
There is an epidemic of hate, including a crisis of anti-Semitism, in our country and around the world. We see it on our streets, our college campuses, and our places of worship.
I know it's difficult to have hope and to feel optimistic right now. And to be honest, some days, it's really challenging for me to put myself out here and do this work publicly. And I know it's hard for you too. But we keep fighting because we have no choice but to fight.
Jewish leaders are on the frontlines fighting anti-Semitism through education, advocacy, and building bridges with other communities. It's because of your leadership that we will dismantle prejudice and ensure Jewish safety.
I also want to acknowledge the student leaders who are here with us today. You have stood up to hate and anti-Semitism on college campuses. And, on behalf of our Nation, thank you for your courage. And let me be clear: We have your back.
Ever since that horrific day of October 7, I've been reaching out to Jewish leaders and Jewish students all across the country just to check in and see how they're feeling. And in each of these conversations, my message is always the same: We still need to find and embrace that Jewish joy.
Joy is what I remember most about growing up Jewish. And it's what I felt in some of my favorite moments as Second Gentleman, like returning to my Jewish summer camp and reliving the memory of being voted ""Most Athletic."" [Laughter] Or when I attended—[laughter].
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. [Laughter] You did. [Laughter]
Second Gentleman Emhoff. [Laughter] Or——
Audience member. You're still athletic! [Laughter]
Second Gentleman Emhoff. Or—thank you.
Or when I attended the BBYO International Convention and spoke with—[applause]—there you go—with the next generation of leaders about how proud they are of being Jewish.
And when the Vice President, my wife, and I affixed the first-ever mezuzah on the door of the Vice President's Residence with our entire family there. And honestly, I think it's one of the only times I've ever seen my father cry was during that moment.
So it's that same feeling of joy I want everyone to experience, especially our young people, because we cannot live in fear. We cannot be afraid. We must always raise our voices and live openly and proudly as Jews.
Last year, before my trip to Poland and Germany to recognize International Holocaust Remembrance Day, President Biden pulled me into the Oval Office. He shared with me his memories of visiting the Dachau concentration camp with his children and grandchildren and also how angry his father was that the Allies had not bombed the train tracks leading to the concentration camps.
Then, in the immediate aftermath of October 7, I stood beside President Biden as he condemned the pure evil Hamas unleashed into the world and staunchly proclaimed his support for the Jewish people and Israel.
He reaffirmed America's ironclad commitment to Israel's security, and that hasn't changed. President Biden and Vice President Harris are steadfast in their support of Israel and the entire Jewish community. Thank you.
I am so grateful for their leadership, especially during these challenging times.
So please join me in welcoming President Joe Biden.
The President. Well, thank you, Kamala and Doug. It's an almost—it's an honor to be introduced by the first-ever Jewish spouse of an American President—Vice President.
It's also—have with us the Attorney General, Members of Congress, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who will be here soon; Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who is responsible for this occurring, having sponsored this early on—[applause]—back when she was 12 years old as a—[laughter].
And, to all of you here, welcome to the White House to celebrate extraordinary contributions of Jewish Americans in the Nation. Look, the story of the Jewish people is a story of resilience—absolute resilience—from pain and persecution, to hope and delight even in the darkest times.
The story that endures. Throughout our history, Jewish people helped define and expand the singular idea that binds us together as Americans—this is not hyperbole: freedom. Freedom—the bedrock principle on which this Nation was built and that American Jews fought for since the 1600s after fleeing persecution abroad.
One of our Nation's first commitments to freedom of religion was in the Jewish community in Newport, Rhode Island. It goes back a long way—1790, America was just 14 years old. A local Jewish leader wrote a letter to President George Washington expressing his hope that America would be a nation of religious freedom not just for Jews, but for all citizens, a nation which, quote, ""gives bigotry no sanction [and] persecution no assistance.""
It helped bring—lay the groundwork for religious freedom and the First Amendment in our—amendment in our Constitution.
And ever since, Jews have been in the forefront of helping realize the promise of America for all Americans. Jewish artists, poets helped define the American vision of liberty for millions of people who come to our shores.
And look, Jewish suffragettes and advocates have fought for women's rights, voting rights, every—every right we have. My whole career, every fight to increase civil rights and civil liberties have been led by Jewish community, where I come from. The Jewish faith leaders and citizens march, petition, boarded a bus, demanded civil rights for all.
Jewish scientists and engineers and doctors have led breakthroughs in innovation, technology, and medicine. Across government, Jewish Americans have proudly served our Nation in uniform and elected and appointive office, in Embassies and civil service and our Nation's highest courts.
That's why Jill and I hosted the first-ever High Holiday reception at the White House. The—[applause]. It's important. The first-ever permanent White House menorah, made from the original wood of the White House building to make clear that the history and vibrancy of the Jewish life is woven into the very fabric of America, and it's permanent. It's permanent.
But look, I know today's reception falls on hard times. The trauma of October 7 and its aftermath of the deadliest day the Jewish people have undergone since the Holocaust is still fresh and ongoing and many of—with many of you.
And we have parents of someone being held hostage right now. And we're going to get him home. We're going to get him home, come hell or high water.
Twelve hundred innocent people slaughtered in their kibbutz; massacred at a music festival; brutally raped, mutilated, sexually assaulted. Hundreds taken hostage and thousands more wounded, carrying the scars and the memory of what they endured. You all know someone, directly or indirectly—family, friends—who were stolen from you or are in a harm's way now.
And my commitment to the safety the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist is—as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. [Applause] No, it really is.
My administration is working around the clock to free the remaining hostages, just as we have freed hostages already.
And here with us today is Hersh Goldberg-Polin, and who is still—he is not here with us, but he's still being held by Hamas, and Rachel and Jon are here with us. Stand up, guys. Their love, strength, and compassion inspire the entire world. And I pledge to both of you—and I mean it—and I know you know, Mom, that I mean it—that I will not rest until we bring your loved one home. We've got to bring him home.
And, folks, let me [be; White House correction] clear. I'll always ensure that Israel has everything it needs to defend itself against Hamas and all other enemies, just as I did when Iran's unprecedented attack last month.
We stand with Israel to take out Sinwar and the rest of the butchers of Hamas. We want Hamas defeated. We'll work with Israel to make that happen.
And, consistent with Jewish values in compassion, kindness, and dignity and human life, my team also is providing critical humanitarian assistance to help innocent Palestinian civilians who are suffering greatly because of the war Hamas—Hamas—has unleashed. It's heartbreaking.
As we do this, we're also committed to bring the region together to work toward a two-state solution that provides security, prosperity, and enduring peace for Israel and Palestinians.
And let me be clear: We reject the ICC's application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders. Whatever these warrants may imply, there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas. And it's clear Israel wants all—do all it can to ensure civilian protection.
But let me be clear. Contrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice, what's happening is not genocide.
Audience member. Thank you.
The President. We reject that. And we'll always stand with Israel and its—in the threats against its security.
Compounding the pain and [is; White House correction] a vicious surge of anti-Semitism around the world, here in America as well, in our streets, our social media, and college campuses. It's amazing it's happening. It's absolutely despicable. It's wrong, and it must stop. It must stop.
In America, we respect and protect fundamental rights of free speech to protest peacefully. That's America. But there's no place in any campus in America, any place in America for anti-Semitism, for hate speech that threatens violence of any kind against Jews or anyone else.
Nobody should fear going to synagogue or school or walking on the street wearing a symbol of your faith. That's wrong—simply wrong.
And that's why, long before October 7, I launched the Nation's first National Strategy To Counter Antisemitism. And it's mobilizing the full force of the Federal Government to crack down on anti-Semitism wherever we find it.
We recently cured—secured an additional $400 million, the largest increase ever, in physical security for nonprofits, including synagogues, Jewish community centers, Jewish schools, Jewish nonprofits.
My Department of Education has put colleges on notice that anti-Semitism is discrimination prohibited under title 6 of the Civil Rights Act, period. And the Department has to investigate discriminatively and aggressively—discrimination aggressively.
That's my Special Envoy To Monitor and—[inaudible]—Antisemitism, Deborah—Deborah, you all—where—is Deborah here?
Audience member. Yeah!
The President. Deborah, thank you—Lipstadt—for furthering our efforts all around the world. It matters. This matters.
To the Jewish community, I want you to know: I see your fear, your hurt, and your pain. And let me assure you, as your President: You are not alone. You belong. You always will belong.
Let me close with this. In moments like this, we do well to remember that this ancient story of Jewish resilience endures because of its people. That's what today is all about: feeling the joy and pride of community; honoring the beauty of your unshakeable faith; and celebrating heritage and legacy of Jewish Americans, who continue to enrich every single part of our life.
So thank you for what you've done for America and for the whole world to make it a better place.
May the Jewish people shine their light and shine the light of the—on the world for generations to come, because we need you badly.
So God bless you all, and God protect our troops. Thank you for being here."""
"May 21, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-reception-boston-massachusetts-2,"Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Boston, Massachusetts","""If you have a seat, please take it. If you don't have a seat, I'll even be shorter than I was going to be. Please, sit down.
Mark and Audrey, thank you for the introduction and welcoming me here back to your home. I appreciate it.
The first time, you may have been—your fault. The second time, it's clearly your fault. [Laughter] You know—you should know better.
And, George and Douglas, thank you for cohosting. I really mean it.
And, Governor Maura Healey, I don't know if she's here now still, but she met me at the airplane, and I want to thank her. She's doing a hell of a job.
And also, Michelle, thanks for the passport into town. I appreciate it. [Laughter]
Thank you all for your support. I'm a Delaware guy, and—but there's something special about this city. I mean, it really is. It's just a good feeling to be able to know you can be in Boston and Boston has your back. I really mean it.
I lived—we lived in Newton for a while when I—my dad was working in the shipyards during the war. But it's just a special place. It's like no other city in the world, in my view.
And we're rebuilding the strongest ground campaign in American history and really are. We're trying to get back to just basic block and tackle in campaigns.
So far, there's over 1.8 million people who've contributed to the—this campaign. And the 1.8 million people contributed under $200. People are doing it at 25, 50, 100 bucks. And it's—and we've raised more money than anybody ever has at this point.
And so, in the battleground States, we've opened 150—150 field offices. Trump hasn't opened a single one yet. We've organized—we're organized—and we're ready.
You know, Trump and the MAGA Republicans are really in disarray right now. It's clear that when we [he; White House correction] lost in 2020, something snapped in this guy. And when he—I mean, really, there's something different. He just can't accept the fact he lost. It's just beyond his capacity.
And that's why January 6 happened, in my view. That's why January 6 happened. Every legal avenue Trump tried to change the election failed and unleashed that—that insurrection.
He's now running again. And the threat that Trump poses is greater in a second term than it was in his first. And, again, that's not hyperbole. He's only obsessed with one thing—about losing in 2020. And it's clearly unhinged him. And I mean it, I—the guy is a little unhinged right now.
And he did a long interview with TIME magazine this week. You ought to—if you haven't seen it, get it. Read it. He just straightforward want—saying what he wants to do. He says, ""A lot of people—a lot of people liked the fact that I said I'd be dictator on day one""—""a lot of people."" He—asked if he thought violence could occur if he lost, and he said, ""It depends.""
He called the insurrectionists in prison ""patriots."" He says he's going to release them if he wins—""every one"" of them.
And yesterday his campaign posted online about—he wants to—if he wins, there will be a ""unified Reich,"" like the Third Reich. This is the same guy—this is Hitler's language, not America's. It's no surprise that when he—about 4 months ago, he talked about—I think maybe a little longer—that Hitler did ""some""—quote, ""some good things."" He did ""some good things.""
Trump says if loses again in November, that there will be a ""bloodbath""—a bloodbath—in America. I mean, the guy means what he says. He's not accepting the results of the election when—if he loses again, he pointed out.
And it's clear that all those—all those people auditioning to be his Vice President, they're all singing the same—trying to pass the same litmus test. They've all said the election—even the ones who said that he lost are now saying: ""No, no, he won. Biden stole the election."" And if he loses the election, they're all saying they will not accept the results either.
This has not happened in American history. This has not happened.
Look what he's saying about reproductive freedom. He's bragging that he's the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned. And it was, because of the appointments he made to the bench.
But you know, look at the piece in TIME magazine. He said States should monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate the bans. Monitor women's pregnancies. I mean, you know, prosecute them.
You know, folks, Trump isn't running to lead America. He is running on revenge, and he really is. That's revenge. Revenge, but in no way—is no way to lead the country. That's how he wants to do it.
He's running to lead America into the future. That's what he says he's going to do, but he doesn't want to do that.
Look, I mean, I don't have time and I don't want to keep you standing, but just read what he's saying.
Look, we made some real progress. We've got a way to go.
We've created 15 million new jobs—15 million new jobs—more than anybody has in one term. People have more health insurance than they ever did before—our history, and we still cut the deficit.
And it took Big Pharma, won to lower price prescriptions—for prescription drugs. All the people of—who need insulin. You—all of you know somebody who needs insulin for diabetes. Well, guess what? It was costing $400 a month or more. It's now—can't charge more than 35 bucks a month. Because, by the way, it costs—it costs $10 to make it.
Our reforms not only save lives, but it's saving taxpayers billions of dollars. That one thing of reducing the—the last change we made in terms of Medicare, that's reduced the Federal debt by $160 billion—$160 billion—because they don't have to pay the exorbitant prices anymore.
And look, I'm proud that the new report released by 20 major climate organizations—from the Sierra Club to the Sunrise Movement—cited my administration for taking more than 300 actions related to climate, conservation, public health, and clean energy.
And Boston is a national leader, including the New England Aquarium, which is focused on coastal erosion and so much more.
And I'm proud to have restored protections for the Northeast Canyons and the Seamounts in the natural—as national—monuments. It's a big deal. It's going to be here for a long time.
And we've also put more land in conservation than any—somebody—since John Kennedy. And we're going to put 30 percent of all the land and seas in conservation by the year 2030.
Meanwhile, Trump is determined to get rid of the climate law—I mean, he's being straightforward about it—I mean, he flat out wants to get rid of it—get rid of it, because the oil companies hate it.
In fact, it has been reported that he asked Big Oil to direct $1 billion toward his campaign and said if they did that, there'd be ""a deal."" ""We'd have a deal.""
What's the deal? They want to—they—Big Oil—it's not about getting lower prices for—he wants Big Oil to fund his campaign in exchange—in exchange for a repeal of everything we've done on climate. That's what he said in TIME magazine. Just look at it. It's on the front—there was a front cover of him last—I guess it's this past month. And he just says one thing. He wants to drill, drill, drill.
This is the same guy that told you if you had windmills off your coast, it was going to cause cancer. And we're going—I mean it's just—it's—it almost is hard to believe what he says.
And the threat just isn't Trump; it's his MAGA Republican Congress. The House of Representatives put together a plan, and I just—I wasn't going to take the time, but I think I should. The Congressional Budget Office analysis, which is a bipartisan operation—it's not Democrat or Republican—did an analysis of his—of the budget that the House Republicans put out. Okay?
It cuts Social Security by $1.5 trillion. Raise your retirement age by 2 years. Raise Medicare costs by repealing the ability to negotiate drug prices, the caps on insulin, and a $2,000 out-of-pocket—package limitation for seniors. Turn Medicare into a premium support voucher-style program that raises premiums for all seniors. Repeal the Affordable Care Act protections against denying care for people with preexisting conditions. There's over 20 million people who have preexisting conditions—that wouldn't be able to get insurance without the existence of that act.
He also says he wants—they're saving—they're going to use savings for a $5.5 trillion tax cut and repeal the minimum tax on corporations and real estate.
Look, I come from the corporate State of the world. More folks are—more corporations are incorporated in my State than every other State in the Union combined. I represented the State for over 36 years in the Senate. I'm not anticorporation, but there's got to be some balance—what we're talking about—just some balance.
And he says that the national abortion ban, they—this is the House—endorsed life as a—at moment of conception—no rape, no incest exceptions, and no bans—and he wants to ban even—they're talking about banning certain contraceptions.
He defunds the Community Oriented Policing Services—the COPS Program—that support local law enforcement in 500 towns and cities all across America.
I could go on. They're just saying it out loud what they're going to do.
Folks, we're lowering costs, expanding opportunities, protecting freedoms. We have to keep that going because all—it's all at stake.
Look, let me close with this. Our freedoms—in my view, our freedoms and our democracy are literally at stake. I know that sounds like hyperbole.
Some of you may remember, when I ran the first time—and you helped me the very first time, a lot of you in this room, but my—this household—that, in fact, if—we talked about how he was going to do a number of things that were contrary to everything we thought would happen.
And I made a speech shortly before the election—made a speech—and after the election as well—on the threat to democracy. And I did it at Constitution [Independence; White House correction] Hall. And I—at, you know, where they wrote the Declaration—I mean, excuse me, where they wrote the Constitution.
And I laid it out. And the press—there are a lot of good press here, and I'm not being critical. But they wondered why I was focused on that, because I said democracy was at stake.
Well, guess what? Sixty-three percent of the American people in the polls said they thought it was too, because of the things that are happening.
That's why I need you. I need you, I need you, because I know we can do this together. I've never been more optimistic about our future. We just have to remember who in the hell we are.
In 2020, I wasn't going to run again because I had just lost my—not just—I had lost my son on Memorial Day in 2015. He was in Iraq, and he was near one of those burn pits for a year, and he came home with stage-4 glioblastoma and died.
And I wasn't going to run again until—remember what happened when—down in Charlottesville, Virginia, when that group came out of the woods carrying torches, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile—the same exact bile—that was chanted in Germany in the early thirties, carrying swastikas—not a joke—carrying swastikas, and saying what they wanted to do? And a young woman was killed, and I ended up talking to her mother. And—accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan.
And afterwards, the press went to her—him and said—to Trump and said, ""What's your view of all this?"" He said there were very good people on both sides—very good people on both sides.
That's not who in the hell we are, guys. That's not who we are. But if we don't watch it—if we don't watch it—and I know I'm responsible to make sure not to let you down, but we have to win. And you're all putting me in a position to be able to compete and win. And I hope I don't screw it up for you. Because if I do, it's—and by the way, the national press is here. I'm going to say it again. I go to—I've been deeply involved in foreign policy my whole career—chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee; I know all the heads of state before, and I know them now. Barack asked me to be Vice President in large part because of my foreign policy background.
And I go to these international meetings of heads of state—the G-7, the G-20, all—and I give you my word: Every one of those meetings, and I've attended a number of them since I've become President, somebody will grab you—another President or another Prime Minister or head of state will grab my arm as I'm walking out, pull me aside, and say: ""You can't let him win. You can't let him win."" And then they look at me and say, ""Because""—meaning their—""my democracy is at stake.""
Folks, there's a lot at stake. We talk about—it's not an important election because I'm running. That's not the reason why it's important. This is one of the most important elections of our life.
I've said to other people that, you know, when I run, I always want to win. Everybody wants—I'm a competitor. But this isn't about my winning. It's about making sure he doesn't win.
You're putting me in a position to be competitive enough to make sure that he doesn't. So, thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, you know, as I said, this is the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity. We're the only Nation in the world—the only Nation in the world—that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in. Think about it, as a student of history. Every crisis we face, we come out stronger than we went in.
And the world is looking to us. They really are. Whether it's in Israel or Gaza, whether it's in Ukraine, where—where it is. They're tough decisions, but we can make them. And we have to stick together.
Thanks for putting me in the position to compete.""	Remarks at a Campaign Reception in Boston, Massachusetts"
"May 22, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-with-president-william-ruto-kenya-meeting-with-business-leaders,Remarks With President William Ruto of Kenya in a Meeting With Business Leaders,"""President Biden. Hello, everyone. It's great to be here. I—Secretary Raimondo, thank you for the update you gave us. And I want to thank all the folks around this table for prioritizing a partnership that I think is really, really important and will deliver dividends for both our countries.
And finally, Mr. President, I can't thank you—think of a better way to kick off this visit. When I visited Nairobi as Vice President, I said that the true strength of Kenya was its people and the students, workers, founders, activists, innovators, entrepreneurs, and so many people like you who really do depend on democracy and support democracy.
President Ruto. Thank you.
President Biden. And today, as we honor 60 years of ties between our countries, it's clear that our people are the true strength of this partnership and a partnership that's working well. Nowhere is it more important than in the realm of innovation. That's why we have so many business leaders around this table.
From Silicon Valley to Silicon Savannah—[laughter]—our people have brought us forward, and they've pioneered new technologies that are transforming millions of lives—I mean, literally, millions of lives, and it's going to go beyond that. And we've invested in new industries that have generated billions of dollars economically, and they've created new opportunities that have lifted up our countries across both our continents.
And our people and our innovators have also brought together—we've—are all excited about this. I mean, I've not seen my team so excited about a visit in a long time. And I think it's all because of the American companies that are here, but—oh, I'm only kidding. [Laughter]
As—and, President, as you and I discussed—and we'll discuss tomorrow—we're launching a new era of technology—technological cooperation between Kenya and America, including new exchanges and investments in key fields of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and semiconductors. And this progress is thanks in large part to the leaders around this table.
So my message is really straightforward and simple. Thank you and thank you, and keep it up. We're going to see more technological change in the next 10 years—I've been saying this for a long time, and I mean it—than we've seen in the last 50 years.
And we need your help to seize this moment. We really do. And we need your—we need you to help us find opportunities to bring the public and private sectors together. And we need you to help us strengthen the supply chains and industries of the future, including clean energy and e-commerce as well. And we need you to keep investing in the diversity of our democracies, which will make this innovation possible.
So, in return, I promise we'll prioritize technological partnerships between our countries. And as Ambassador Whitman—and by the way, she's smarter than I am. [Laughter] She's handling everything.
I was amazed. We had a meeting earlier. I'm going to—this is ad-libbing—but she sat there, and she had more statistical data to spout off without any piece of paper in her hand. It amazed me. I don't know. It reminded me of my sister. [Laughter]
But—[laughter]—but look, I think we really can seize the moment. In return, I think, as I said, we're going to prioritize the technological partnership between our countries and—and the former CEO—who was also a former CEO, is going to make sure that happens.
And Vice President Harris is already building a new public-private partnership to increase investments in innovation.
And because our cooperation matters, it's not just for our own people, but for people around the world. If this relationship continues to grow, as it is, I think it benefits not only the United States and Kenya, but will lead and will have positive benefits literally around the world.
So thank you again for being here. And look forward to working with you, and you know, we'll keep investing in the true strengths of our nations, our people, and—in the years ahead.
And with that, Mr. President, I'm going to turn it over to you. You've got it.
President Ruto. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. President. And, on behalf of my delegation and I, to, in a very special way, thank you for extending an invitation to me to undertake this state visit.
I bring you very warm greetings from the people of Kenya and our brothers and sisters from across the continent. And I undertake this state visit from the background of 60 years of solid friendship between the United States and Kenya.
And specifically, Mr. President, on the subject we are driving today here on the digital space, on technology, and the whole space around investment, trade, and the relationship that we have managed to build over the years to confirm to you that Kenya is a young tech country.
And as you have said correctly, we have spent a lot of time working with our technology companies, our technology investors. We've had twinning relationships between Silicon Savannah in Kenya and Silicon Valley in the U.S.
And this meeting is about what we can do together around digital jobs, business-process outsourcing, research and development. And, Mr. President, one very important aspect is the CHIPS Act, which, hopefully, we will be able to have a conversation about in the coming days.
And, Your Excellency, it speaks to the wealth of opportunity that exists between Kenya and the United States. Our young population—talented, educated, innovative—and American technology that is cutting edge and investment capital and investors that are hungry for opportunities not just in Kenya, but in our continent is a perfect match for this moment.
I think we have a historic moment to explore investment opportunities between Kenya and the United States.
And, Mr. President, under your leadership, we believe that as we celebrate these 60 years of relationship between our two countries, we also celebrate the opportunities that come with a friendship that exists between our two countries.
And, as you have said correctly, the space around artificial intelligence, space around cybersecurity, and investments that come with it, we are expanding our footprint in the digital space. We are rolling out 100,000 kilometers of fiber optic in Kenya and connecting every ward and every village to fiber by backbone to make sure that e-commerce, digital jobs, and digital learning, we can access to every child in Kenya.
And we are very proud that we are going to work with American companies. Last month, Secretary Raimondo was in Kenya. And we agreed with her on the kind of investments, the level of investment, the type of investment that needs to be fashioned between our two sides. And my being here today is a confirmation that we are moving from ideas into action and from opportunities into investments.
And hopefully, we will be able to sign off some of those investments. We have semiconductor companies here from Kenya. We have large corporates—fintech corporates in Kenya, one of them M-PESA. And we are going to be discussing the opportunities in that space.
And I look forward, Mr. President, to consummating some of the discussions around this table into concrete investments going into the future.
President Biden. Looking forward to it.
Thank you, all.
Q. Mr. President, do you welcome Netanyahu addressing Congress?""	Remarks With President William Ruto of Kenya in a Meeting With Business Leaders"
"May 23, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-william-ruto-kenya,The President's News Conference With President William Ruto of Kenya,"""President Biden. Good afternoon, everyone. Please have a seat.
Mr. President, six decades ago, when Kenya was—declared its independence, President Lyndon Baines Johnson wrote a letter from our Nation to yours. And he said, ""May the responsibilities of freedom wake the best that is in you.""
Today we are—mark 60 years of partnership between our democracies, and we're fulfilling that wish together, and we're continuing. I truly believe that it has brought out the best in both of us. Not only in Kenya and America, but around the world, it's had positive impact.
But through our partnership, we are continuing to meet our responsibilities in four key areas.
First, I'm proud to announce we're working with Congress to designate Kenya a major non-NATO ally. That's a fulfillment of years of collaboration.
Our joint counterterrorism operations have degraded ISIS and al-Shabaab across East Africa. Our mutual support for Ukraine has rallied the world to stand behind the U.N. Charter. And our work together on Haiti is helping pave the way to reduce instability and insecurity.
And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for Kenya's leadership of the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti.
Our new partner—global partnership is going to build on all this progress. We're going to make—meet new challenges and with more resources. And it's going to strengthen the security of our countries and our—countries around the world.
Second, we're deepening our economic cooperation. Both President Ruto and I have focused on growing economies—our growing economies and growing them from the bottom up and the middle out and the bottom up. And when that happens, everybody does well, not the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. That's true in Kenya, that's true in America, and that's true around the world.
Right now many companies—many countries, debt stands in the way of growth. Too many nations are forced to make a choice between development and debt, between investing in their people and paying back their creditors.
So today we're launching what we're calling the Nairobi-Washington Vision. This initiative is going to bring together international financial institutions and nations from all around the world to mobilize more resources for countries saddled with debt; to open more opportunities to the private-sector financing; and to promote transparent, sustainable, and affordable lending practices.
These are big goals. It's going to take time to see lasting progress.
But we're providing $250 million—the United States is—to the World Bank in a crisis-response window. In the coming weeks, the United States is going to make an additional $21 billion available to the International Monetary Fund.
And today I'm proud to announce there'll be $250 billion in new lending capacity from multilateral development banks like the World Bank to help low-income nations invest in their development and tackle growing challenges. This is supported by the United States and many other countries as well.
Next, we're launching a new era of technology—technological cooperation between the United States and Kenya. That means new partnerships: new partnerships with industry, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and cybersecurity companies; new initiatives to expand affordable internet all across East Africa; new education programs that are going to bring Kenyan students to the United States to study in the STEM fields.
And I'm proud to announce that I am working with Congress to make Kenya the first country in Africa to receive funding through the CHIPS and Science Act, which has served us well.
This funding would link their supply chains to the United States and to our partners and spur innovation that extends from Silicon Valley in California to Silicon Savannah in Kenya, which, by the way, is already a $1 billion tech hub—already a billion-dollar tech hub.
Finally, we are ensuring democracy delivers for our people. That includes Kenya's diaspora community here in the United States.
Two years ago, our Nation's first Black Vice President, President Kamala Harris, launched the Nation's first Presidential Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement. Today, we're building on her work to strengthen longstanding bonds between our people.
I also want to thank you, Mr. President, for taking action to implement the long-awaited Public Benefits Organization Act, which provides historic protections for civil society and NGOs all across Kenya.
Like you, I believe the future is going to be won by countries that unleash the full potential—the full potential—of their populations, including civil society, women, and young people. And I look forward to working together to implement this act and jump-starting anticorruption reforms to promote democratic values that bind our nations together.
Now, let me close with this. Taken together, these are responsibilities Kenya and America must meet in the years ahead—meet them together, as partners—for security, for prosperity, for innovation, and most importantly, for democracy.
But I know these responsibilities will wake the best in us. And I know we'll bring—not only bring our nations together, but I want to thank you for—again, Mr. President, for being here and knowing we have even bigger dreams for the cooperation of our countries.
The floor is yours, sir.
President Ruto. Thank you, Mr. President. And I want to—in a very, very sincere way—thank you, Mr. President, for inviting me to make this state visit to the United States on behalf of the people and Government of Kenya. I also take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude for the warm welcome we have received on arrival and the excellent hospitality of the American people.
My visit provides us, Mr. President, with the opportunity to celebrate 60 years of bilateral relations rooted on shared values of freedom, democracy, rule of law, equality, and inclusivity.
My visit takes place at a time when democracy is perceived to be retreating worldwide. The accelerating drift towards regimes indifferent to democratic values is of deep concern to us, and I believe it is time the U.S., working with Kenya, deploys its capabilities and rally likeminded democratic countries to set up the cause for democracy.
During our discussions, we agreed on the significant opportunity for the U.S. to radically recalibrate its strategy and strengthen its support for Africa, as discussed at the U.S.-Africa Leadership Summit, by enhancing its investment in the institutions of African integration and increasing support for peace and security.
As we take this historic step of elevating our partnership to be more effective in addressing global challenges, it is important for us to appreciate that many countries in Africa, including Kenya, are struggling with an overwhelming convergence of multiple shocks, including extreme climate events, debt distress, and the destructive—disruptive upheavals in Europe and the Middle East, whose cumulative impact is to divert national resources from investment in people and economic growth into managing climate-induced crisis and servicing sovereign debt.
For this reason, I have underscored the imperative for our partnership to facilitate recovery from these multiple crises and particularly for the United States of America to take a leading role in a comprehensive debt resolution framework by doubling contributions to the concessionary financing window of the World Bank and also to work with the IMF on rechanneling SDRs to institutions like the Africa Development Bank to further leverage on private-sector funding to support countries.
Unless this is done and done immediately, the values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law are in great jeopardy.
On regional peace and security in the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region, I express optimism that Kenya and the U.S. will innovatively design appropriate defense and security frameworks to help Kenya, as the anchor state, and the region in general to deal with the peace and security challenges that are undermining human well-being, slowing down development, and also having a negative impact on democracy.
We affirmed our mutual commitment to the stabilization of Haiti through the Multinational Security Support Mission.
The Kenya-U.N. Climate and Clean Energy Industrial Partnership we have just committed to is an encouraging milestone on our collective journey and builds on the paradigm shift we have inaugurated at the Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi last year. Accordingly, Africa's resource potential is a huge opportunity to deploy U.S. technology and investment to catalyze unprecedented growth through green industrialization.
We've also agreed to hasten the renewal of the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act to sustain the rising momentum of our investments and exports in the manufacturing space.
Similarly, we agreed to undertake sustainable green growth by facilitating conclusion of our Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership, alongside the renewal of AGOA.
During our discussions, I witnessed firsthand President Biden's and the U.S. Government's determination to make our partnership work and resolve to spread and deepen the roots of freedom, democracy, security, and prosperity throughout the world.
As my visit comes to a close, I am confident that our engagements have laid a solid foundation for us to continue the work—the good work we have begun with stronger faith and greater hope for success, because, in Joe Biden, Kenya and Africa have a strong and committed friend.
I thank you.
President Biden. Thank you, Mr. President. And you do have a friend. And you know, the African Continent is going to have a billion people not too soon. The idea we're going to ignore it, it makes no sense at all.
First question: Michael Wilner, McClatchy.
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions, if I may. On——
President Biden. No, one. [Laughter]
Haiti 
Q. I'm going to do my level best. On Haiti and on Israel. Your administration went on a worldwide search for security forces—Beninese forces, Bangladeshi, Canadian, Chilean—any but American forces—to stand up this Multinational Security Support Mission for Haiti before Kenya stood up to lead.
Can you explain why it is that you believe, on the one hand, that this mission is so critical and, on the other, why it is that you have categorically ruled out contributing U.S. Forces to this effort? Is it your goal to beat back Haiti's gangs or to contain them?
And on Israel. Does the United States——
President Biden. One question. I'll answer your question.
Q. Okay. Yes, well, let me——
President Biden. Your question—your question with regard to Haiti is: We concluded that for the United States to deploy forces in the hemisphere just raises all kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented about what we're trying to do and be able to be used by those who disagree with us and against our—against the interests of Haiti and the United States.
So we set out to find a partner or partners who would lead that effort that we would participate in, not with American forces, but with supplies and making sure they have what they needed. And so, you know, I'm very grateful for President Ruto's leadership here. A multinational effort, but Kenya's willingness to really lead this matter matters. You're not the only country, but you're leading this effort.
And there's going to be U.S. Forces not on the ground, but we're going to supply logistics, intelligence, and equipment. Matter of fact, some equipment has already arrived. And Kenya is stepping up with police, and other countries plan to do as well. The United States is going to support the collective effort here.
And of course, Kenya won't be going in alone. We're working with Congress to provide $300 million to MSS Mission and an additional $60 million for equipment assistance. And we have also—we have received and are continuing to bring major contributions from other partners in as well.
President Ruto and I agree that the Haitian people deserve better. They deserve peace and security. And I thank him for taking on this responsibility. But we have his back, and we're there all the way.
Q. I do have a question for you, President Ruto.
International Criminal Court 
But before I do, I do very briefly have a question on whether the United States has any evidence at all that would substantiate the ICC Prosecutor's specific allegations against Israeli leaders that they are using starvation as a tactic of war in Gaza—or exculpatory evidence, for that matter—and would—if you would commit to releasing that information before any potential issuance of ICC arrest warrants.
And, President Ruto, the mission that Kenya is about to lead in Haiti is obviously a support mission; that is well known. But the fact is that Haiti's national police have been internationally funded and trained for some time and, nevertheless, have obviously failed to beat back these gangs.
Will Kenyan forces, in partnership with the MSS, be out front in the fight against these gangs? Or will they be a static force behind the HNP? And are you concerned about casualties among the Kenyan forces?
President Ruto. Thank you very much.
Kenya believes that the responsibility of peace and security anywhere in the world, including in Haiti, is the collective responsibility of all nations and all peoples who believe in freedom, self-determination, democracy, and justice.
And it is the reason why Kenya took up this responsibility, because we have been participating in peacemaking and we have been participating in peacekeeping over the last 40 years in 47 countries, including very difficult neighborhoods, like what we are going to face in Haiti.
We are going to take up that responsibility alongside the Haiti police. And we have clear modus operandi how we are going to relate with the situation on the ground that has been agreed under the United Nations framework.
So we are looking forward to this deployment because we believe that the women and children in Haiti deserve peace, like all other women and children and people around the world.
President Biden. Look, we made my position known on ICC. You guys never keep the deal, but that's okay. [Laughter] That—you know, we've made our position clear on the ICC. We don't think the—we don't recognize their jurisdiction—the ICC—the way it's being exercised. And it's that simple. We don't think there's an equivalence between what Israel did and what Hamas did.
Okay, next. I—do I ask the next question as well?
President Ruto. Let me ask Ayub Abdikadir [Citizen TV Kenya] from Kenya for the next question. [Inaudible]
Afghanistan/Haiti/Democratic Republic of the Congo 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. One question, and this is on Haiti. [Laughter]
President Biden, Kenya is rather doing the heavy lifting in our turbulent regions: Somalia, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Washington, as you have mentioned, has committed millions of dollars for the cost in Haiti.
Isn't it ironic that while America is ending its forever wars in Afghanistan—the latest in 2021, under your leadership, when you withdrew troops from Kabul—and that you're committing Kenya to another foreign wars 12,000 kilometers away from Nairobi?
I mean, why the discrepancy? Why the dichotomy, while you're ending your forever wars, overseas wars, yet you are committing Kenya to Haiti? Can you explain that?
President Biden. Very easily. [Laughter]
There's a reason why Afghanistan has been known as the ""graveyard of empires."" The likelihood of anybody uniting Afghanistan is highly, highly, highly unlikely. Number one.
Number two, there are ways to control ISIS other than occupying Afghanistan. It was an unnecessary need.
Now, with regard to Haiti, Haiti is in the area of the Caribbean that is very volatile. There's a lot going on in this hemisphere. And we're in a situation where we want to do all we can without us looking like America, once again, is stepping over and deciding ""this is what must be done.""
Haitians are looking for help, as well as the folks in the Caribbean are looking for help.
And so we checked out with a number of other countries. The one who stepped up was Haiti [Kenya; White House correction]. We've committed to provide them the wherewithal—the intelligence and equipment and the like—to Haiti. And so it's a logical thing.
And you have a first-rate capability, and you keep your word. That's an important dynamic.
President Ruto. I agree with President Biden that Kenya's participation in Haiti is not so much about what happened in the past. It's about what we believe in: the peace and security of humanity.
And we don't find that the U.S. is committing Kenya, because the U.S. cannot commit Kenya. I am the President of Kenya. It's me to make that decision. And it's the people of Kenya to commit their own troops, using their own structures.
We've gone through the processes in Kenya. Parliament has approved. We have a clear mandate. We have a clear framework. And it is us, the people of Kenya, who made this decision in the interest of serving peace and stability as a responsible global citizen and understanding that insecurity, instability anywhere is insecurity and instability everywhere.
President Biden. And by the way, you asked about—you implied that we weren't doing anything anywhere else. Well, we're kind of occupied around the world. But we're also engaging in Congo, in the neighborhood, and you know, we're going to continue to help alleviate human suffering there.
The United States is the largest humanitarian donor, providing $375 million in humanitarian funding just this year, including support for more than 6 million displaced people from the D.R.C. So we are engaged in more than one place.
Q. Follow-up to my President, Dr. Ruto. You said that Kenya is committed. And in your Carter speech in Atlanta, you said it's based on humanitarianism, helping Haiti out. But can you explain the geopolitical goal 12,000 kilometers away from Nairobi when schools in the counties of Baringo, West Pokot, and Turkana have not yet opened because of the banditry problem, yet you are committing our national police force to Haiti? And where is the priority, this being one of your major manifesto pillars, talking about security?
And to the extent that even the Defense Cabinet Secretary talked about the deployment of, if need be, the Kenyan military or the special personnel to make sure that schools are reopened, children go to school in areas that are bandit-prone in Kenya. Why are you committing to Haiti when we have a problem back home? Isn't it an irony that you are putting [out; White House correction] the fire in the faraway neighbor's home when your—when our own home is on fire?
President Ruto. Thank you very much. I made a commitment to the people of Kenya to sort out insecurity in the North Rift. I have followed that with action. As we talk, there are 3,000 military officers in the North Rift, 2,000 police officers in the North Rift. We have renovated the first 15 schools and completed—we have reopened 20 schools already that were closed in the North Rift.
And that exercise is ongoing. We have made tremendous progress in making sure that we create security at home. But that does not take away our responsibility. Even as we were deploying troops and policemen in our own country in North Rift to sort out the banditry problem, we still deployed 1,000 troop—1,000 troop—troops to D.R.C. Congo because that is our neighborhood.
We have 5,000 troops in Somalia because, equally, that is our responsibility. And Haiti should not be an exception. That's why deploying a thousand security men to Haiti speaks to the same belief and commitment to peace and security.
President Biden. The next question is from April Ryan [Grio].
Haiti 
Q. Mr. Presidents—President Biden, President Ruto—thank you.
First of all, when you talk about Haiti, President Ruto, you said, ""Haiti is a collective responsibility for all nations."" And for you, Mr. President—President Biden, President Ruto—do you believe that these nations can break the back of this militia that has gripped the nation there?
And also, when it comes to Congo—thank you, Mr. President, for bringing up what the United States is doing for the Congo, especially as that flag was behind you at Morehouse. Mr. President, could you tell me what the African Union is doing, as well as Kenya is doing, when it comes to the humanitarian crisis in the Congo? Thank you.
President Biden. What was my question? [Laughter]
Q. Sir, your question was Haiti. Can——
President Biden. Yes.
Q. ——the United States and Kenya or the nations collectively break the backs of this coordinated militia that has the grips of the nation—that nation? Thank you.
President Biden. Yes.
Q. Tell me how please. [Laughter]
President Biden. The very way we're doing it. We're not talking about a thousand-person army that's made up of trained persons—this is a crisis that's able to be dealt with. And we think we can—dealt with this way with a multinational approach with Haiti leading the way and us providing the intelligence as well as equipment.
President Ruto. Gangs and criminals do not have nationalities. They have no religion. They have no language. Their language is one: to deal with them firmly, decisively, within the parameters of the law. And that's why we're building a coalition of nations beyond Kenya and the U.S., many who are making contributions towards the MSS force in Haiti, to secure that country and to break the back of the gangs and the criminals that have visited untold suffering in that country.
On D.R.C., the AU, the East African Community, and Kenya has seized—[inaudible]—I've just told you that Kenya had a thousand troops in Haiti. We now have another 800—not in Haiti, but in D.R.C. We now have another 800 troops from SADC.
We are going to be having a meeting of the East African Community. I did send my Minister of—my Foreign Minister to Kinshasa. They had a conversation. And shortly, we will be looking at how to begin the dialogue process under the Nairobi Process, because we believe there is no military solution to what is going on in D.R.C. But instead, dialogue should be able to give us the necessary momentum and outcomes that would solve the matters in eastern D.R.C.
So both the AU, the East African Community, and Kenya as a country are seized of that matter. We know that the humanitarian crisis in eastern D.R.C. has displaced close to 7 million people.
And I want to thank the United States of America for stepping in with humanitarian support for that region, because it is a collaboration of different countries in different ways to deal with that situation. The rest of us are committing troops. We are committing our—deploying our infrastructure to facilitate the resolution of the matters in D.R.C.
President Biden. Is that it?
Q. Mr. President?
President Ruto. Let me ask Nancy Agutu [Radio Africa Group] from Kenya. She is here? Okay, Nancy.
International Monetary Fund/International Development Association 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Africa is asking America to lead the way and double its contribution to the World Bank's International Development Assistance to help developing countries access more financing to alleviate debt distress and to tackle climate change. What is your commitment on this? Thank you.
President Biden. Would you—I'm sorry. I didn't catch all your question.
Q. Sorry. I'm saying Africa is asking America to lead the way and double its contribution to the World Bank's International Development Assistance to help developing countries——
President Biden. Yes.
Q. ——to access financing to alleviate debt distress and to tackle climate change. What is your commitment on this?
President Biden. We made a major commitment to this.
Number one, as I said, the United States has long championed international financial institutions that provide low-cost concessional resources to the poorest developing countries, including from the IMF.
To that end, my administration helped design and establish the IMF's new initiative that provides low-cost funding to—for countries that are taking steps to enhance their resilience. Important partners in Africa have the capital they—ensure they have their capital they need to invest in their futures.
We heard them, and we stand with them. Now, that's why we've worked with Congress to enable the United States to make available in the coming weeks up to $21 billion in new lending resources to the IMF trust fund that provides concessional lending to the poorest countries.
It's a little like a—you know, having to go—when you're in debt, having to go and find someone to help you out. That's what this is about.
We believe supporting your friends and in this partnership is happy to—we were happy to do our part.
And look, we've also doubled our commitment to the IDA. And I'm proud the United States is the biggest donor to the IDA in this cycle and proud to be working with—alongside Kenya to support robust financing and a policy package that are going to help the most vulnerable countries address their investment needs.
There's debt and there's growth, and you can't—you've got to deal with the debt before you deal with the growth. And so what we're—we're trying to use international lending organizations to be able to provide that capability so people can grow. That's what it's about.

"May 25, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/commencement-address-the-united-states-military-academy-west-point-new-york-5,"Commencement Address at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York","""The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
General Gilland, Secretary Wormuth, General George, Members of Congress. And by the way, one of the Members of Congress up here, I'm flying up with him, and he's bragging about being from this district and maybe graduated from this academy. Stand up, Ryan. Stand up, Congressman. Fellow graduate right there.
Faculty, staff, soldiers, officers, family, and friends, most of all, West Point Class of 2024: In 1776, British forces had driven General Washington's army out of New York City. The British Navy dominated the coast of New England. If they could control the Hudson, they could cut colonies in half, divide and conquer, a classic strategy.
But General Washington saw it coming. He knew there was a place on the Hudson where the river bent with a plateau overhead. The Americans placed artillery batteries along the river, stretched an iron chain across the water, and built a fort on a plain called West Point.
West Point, George Washington said—[applause]. George Washington said West Point was the ""key of America."" He was right. The British never captured the Hudson. They failed to divide and conquer us. And a few years later, they surrendered at the Battle of Yorktown.
Audience members. Yeah!
The President. You've got it, man.
The most powerful empire in the world defeated by an army of ordinary people driven by the sacred cause of freedom. And I might add, you're about to become full-time members of the most honorable and the most consequential fighting force in the history of the world—that's not hyperbole—of the world. That's the truth.
Ever since, men and women of West Point have stayed true to this mission. And today 1,036 graduates of the class of 2024 will join the Long Gray Line that has never failed us and never, ever will.
Together, you survived the Beast Barracks—[laughter]—and countless hours of PT. You completed rigorous academics at the—America's first, toughest engineering school in the country. You met the highest standards of discipline.
And of course, no one is perfect. Even Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower were written up from time to time—you know I'm not kidding—[laughter]—when they were cadets here at West Point. If that sounds familiar to you, maybe I can help you today. In keeping with a longstanding tradition, as Commander in Chief, I absolve all cadets on restriction for minor conduct offenses. [Laughter] If you have any questions, the Superintendent can clarify what ""minor"" means. [Laughter]
Of course, your time here wasn't all difficult. The class did plenty of celebrating every time you beat Navy. Now, look, lots of West Point classes have some wins over Navy. But not every class, over a 4-years period, beats Navy 51 times. As they say in Delaware, ""You done good.""
A few weeks ago, I was honored to present the Commander in Chief's Trophy to the Black Knights at the White House. I told them I don't take sides. But my son Beau was a decorated major in the United States Army. He spent a year in Iraq. And he always made it clear who he expected the family to root for in the game in Philadelphia. [Laughter]
Parenthetically, I was appointed by my—the fellow I ran against when I was 29 years old to the Naval Academy. I was one of 10. I wanted to play football. And my—the day I was supposed to go down for the interview, a classmate of mine who was also one of the 10 appointed to be chosen from—a kid named Steve Dunning—came to pick me up.
And I had found out 2 days earlier they had a quarterback named Roger Staubach and a halfback named Joe Bellino. I said, ""Hell, I'm not going there."" [Laughter] I went to Delaware. [Laughter] Not a joke. [Laughter]
And by the way, that same fellow, he was a wonderful man. I had—in our last debate, when I was 29 years old, he was—the first question he was asked at the debate was, ""Do you have any regrets, Senator Boggs?"" And he said, ""No."" Then we came to the very end of the debate, where I spoke and then he was to conclude. He stood up, and he said: ""You know, I was asked whether I had any regrets. I said no, but I have one: Had Joe Biden gone to the Naval Academy when I appointed him, he'd still have 7 months left on and wouldn't be able to run."" [Laughter]
Cadets, as proud as your country is today, your families are even prouder. At R-Day 4 years ago, because of the pandemic, they could not spend the day on post. It was a challenging way to begin the West Point experience. So I'm thrilled today so many of your loved ones get to see you here.
To everyone who helped raise these remarkable young people, this is your day as well. Because we know, as the English poet John Milton wrote, ""They also serve who only stand and wait."" Cadets, it's time for you to stand up now and thank your parents. Stand up, turn, and thank them. You owe them big.
The class of '24 is an extraordinary group. You include the Army's alltime home run leader; athletes who have swum laps around Manhattan Island, which I could never quite figure out, and the son of an Iraqi interpreter for the American forces, one of your class's two Rhodes Scholars.
You hail from all 50 States and 12 countries. Some of you are third-generation West Pointers. Others are the first in your family to join the U.S. Armed Forces. And at least one of you has a twin brother graduating from Annapolis this year. [Laughter]
I tell you what, I don't want to be at that family reunion. [Laughter] Every time you show up to the Army-Navy game, I don't know how the hell you're going to do it. But any rate. [Laughter]
Look, I wish I could praise every single cadet one by one, because you deserve it. You make our entire nation proud, and that's not hyperbole. You do. As your Commander in Chief, let me say again: Congratulations. You've earned every bit of what you've—[inaudible]—going to get today.
Look, the motto of this class, ""Like None Before,"" was an appropriate choice for your class, because you're graduating into a world—as a student of history, I can tell you—""like none before."" I've been a Senator since I was 29 years old, never left Government. And, ladies and gentlemen, the world is not only changing rapidly, it's also, the pace of change is accelerating. And the range of missions that our servicemen are carrying out are ""like none before"" as well.
There's never been a time in history when we've asked our military to do so many different things in so many different places around the world all at the same time.
Right now American soldiers are supporting brave Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Our soldiers are working around the clock to keep munitions and equipment moving by land, sea, and air. They're training Ukrainians on how to use advanced weapons systems, like HIMARS, Patriots, and Abrams tanks, and they're sharing lessons in Tactical Combat Casualty Care with Ukrainian medics and surgeons.
There are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine. I'm determined to keep it that way. But we are standing strong with Ukraine, and we will stand with them. We're standing against a man who I've known well for many years, a brutal tyrant. We may not—we—and we will not—we will not walk away.
Putin was certain that NATO would fracture. I remember them—right after being elected President, before—right after I was sworn in, and we talked about this very issue. In the fall, he had tied—that fall, he decided to—look, I shouldn't get into this, probably—[laughter]—because it gets me a little excited. But Putin was certain that NATO would fracture.
I said to him in Switzerland that, ""You want the Finlandization of Ukraine; you're going to get the Finlandization—you're going to get the NATO-ization of Europe."" He had a brazen vision, which we stepped up and stopped. Instead, today, the greatest defense alliance in the history of the world is stronger than ever. Finland and Sweden are our newest members, and they are tough.
In the Middle East, while we conduct urgent diplomacy to secure an immediate cease-fire that brings hostages home, our Army and Navy have deployed a temporary pier in the—on the Mediterranean in record time to increase lifesaving aid to the Palestinians. The U.S. Air Force has conducted food drops, delivering tens of thousands of meals to the people of Gaza.
In the face of Iran's recent unprecedented attack on Israel, we brought partners together, including Arab nations, to repel the sustained assault. The man running the operation on the ground: General Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, West Point '88. General Kurilla did a superb job.
I was in the Situation Room with our national security team. He was on the screen from the region. He knew the attack was coming, but we weren't sure precisely when it would begin. Then, at 6:34 p.m., the General said to me, ""Mr. President, we just got multiple ballistic missile launches from Iran toward Israel."" Six minutes later, he said, ""There are 30 missiles in the air."" Four minutes after that, he said, ""There's 75 missiles in the air."" Then he said, ""Over 100 missiles in the air.""
Under incredible pressure, General Kurilla and the Combined Joint Task Force performed exceptionally from sea, air, and bases nearby. Thanks to the—99 percent of the missiles and drones of Iran never reached their targets because of the quality of our forces. We swiftly ended—[applause]. We swiftly ended what could have been a devastating attack, and we deescalated the conflict, when it easily could have gone the other way.
On the other side of the world, in the Indo-Pacific, we deepened our alliances. We've created new ones, like AUKUS, our new strategic partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom. Or the trilateral cooperation we've forged with Japan and the Republic of Korea that no one thought was possible: two of our allies cooperating on strategic defense thanks to our leadership. We've begun the new trilateral partnership with Japan and the Philippines as well.
We elevated the Quad—together with Japan, India, and Australia—to advance free, open, secure, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. We're standing up for peace and stability and across the Taiwan Straits. And we've depended on our strategic partnership with Vietnam. I wonder if the classes of '74 are here today could have imagined that they were sitting where you were at the same time and right—during Vietnam.
The upshot of all this: Across vastly different regions and very different challenges, our women and men in uniform are hard at work strengthening our alliances, because no country has allies like ours; investing in deterrence so anyone who thinks they can threaten us thinks again; defending our values by standing up to tyrants; and safeguarding the peace by protecting freedom and openness.
Thanks to the U.S. Armed Forces, we're doing what only America can do as the indispensable nation, the world's only superpower, and the leading democracy in the world. Never forget: America is the strongest when we lead not only by our example of our power, but by the power of our example. You can clap for that.
I want to mention one additional way we've made progress. Every member of our Armed Forces must always be safe and respected in the ranks. For the first time in nearly a decade, rates of sexual assault and sexual harassment have gone down across the Active Duty forces. It's long past time to end the scourge of sexual violence in the military once and for all. And we can do this.
Cadets, make no mistake, there remains a hard-power world. You can't draw any other conclusion when powerful nations try to coerce their neighbors or terrorists attempt evil plots. That's why I'm making historic investments in our military, overhauling our defense industrial base.
For decades, America has had the most powerful military in the world. And that happens because we choose to make it happen. I have always been willing to use force when required to protect our Nation, our allies, our core interests.
And when anyone targets American troops, we will deliver justice to them. That happened earlier this year, when three heroic members of the U.S. Army Reserve were killed in an unmanned drone attack near—in northeast Jordan.
In response, we launched dozens of successful airstrikes against Iran-backed militants. And we'll never forget to honor the memory of those warriors who gave their lives in the fight against terrorism.
Cadets, West Point had made you—has made you leaders of character. In minutes, you'll be United States Army officers. In time, some of you will serve in powerful roles at headquarters, the Pentagon, even in the White House. You'll confront challenges that previous generations of soldiers couldn't imagine.
When that happens, hold fast to your values you learned here at West Point: duty, honor, country. Hold fast to your honor code, which says, quote, ""We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate those who do,"" end of quote. And above all, hold fast to your oath. On your very first day at West Point, you raised your right hands and took an oath, not to a political party, not to a President, but to the Constitution of the United States of America, against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
Members of the Long Gray Line have given their lives for that Constitution. They have fought to defend the freedoms that it protects: the right to vote, the right to worship, the right to raise your voice in protest. They have saved and sacrificed to ensure, as President Lincoln said, a ""Government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the Earth.""
West Pointers know better than anyone: Freedom is not free. It requires constant vigilance. And for—from the very beginning, nothing is guaranteed about our democracy in America. Every generation has an obligation to defend it, to protect it, to preserve it, to choose it. Now is your turn.
Remember what over a thousand graduates of West Point wrote to the class of 2020, 4 years ago: The oath you've taken here, quote, ""has no expiration date,"" they said. Not for you, not for your country. It's important to your nation now as it's ever been. Keep it, honor it, and live it.
Cadets, let me close with this. In the early days of our Nation, as General Washington said, West Point was the ""key of America."" Today, you're still the key because of your commitment to protect what makes America ""America.""
We're unique in the world. We're the only country in the world founded on an idea. Other countries are founded based on geography, ethnicity, religion, or other attributes, but we're the only one founded on an idea—not figuratively, literally. And the idea is, we're all created equal, deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.
But ideas need defenders to make them real. That's what you, the class of 2024, are all about: defenders of freedom, champions of liberty, guardians—and I mean this—guardians of American democracy.
And just as this historic institution helped make America free over two centuries ago, and just as generations of West Point graduates have kept us free through every challenge and danger, you must keep us free at this time, ""like none before.""
I know you can. I know you will. For we are the United States of America, and there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we do it together.
May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Congratulations, class of 2024.""	Commencement Address at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York"
"May 31, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-situation-gaza-palestinian-territories,"Remarks on the Situation in Gaza, Palestinian Territories","""The President. Hello, folks.
[At this point, the President checked his watch.]
Just checking, it's afternoon. [Laughter]
Conviction of Former President Donald J. Trump for Falsifying Business Records 
Good afternoon. Before I begin my remarks, I just wanted to say a few words about what happened yesterday in New York City. The American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed. Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself.
It was a State case, not a Federal case. And it was heard by a jury of 12 citizens—12 Americans, 12 people like you. Like millions of Americans who served on juries, this jury was chosen the same way every jury in America is chosen. It was a process that Donald Trump's attorney was part of.
The jury heard 5 weeks of evidence—5 weeks. And after careful deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous verdict. They found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts. Now he'll be given the opportunity, as he should, to appeal that decision just like everyone else has that opportunity.
That's how the American system of justice works. And it's reckless, it's dangerous, and it's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict. Our justice system has endured for nearly 250 years, and it literally is the cornerstone of America—our justice system.
The justice system should be respected, and we should never allow anyone to tear it down. It's as simple as that. That's America, that's who we are, and that's who we'll always be, God willing.
Situation in Gaza, Palestinian Territories 
Now to another issue. I want to give an update on my efforts to end the crisis in Gaza.
For the past several months, my negotiators of foreign policy, intelligence community, and the like have been relentlessly focused not just on a cease-fire that would inevitably be fragile and temporary, but on a durable end to the war. That's been the focus: a durable end to this war.
One that brings all the hostages home, ensures Israel's security, creates a better ""day after"" in Gaza without Hamas in power, and sets the stage for a political settlement that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.
Now, after intensive diplomacy carried out by my team and my many conversations with leaders of Israel, Qatar, and Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries, Israel has now offered—Israel has offered a comprehensive new proposal.
It's a roadmap to an enduring cease-fire and the release of all hostages. This proposal has been transmitted by Qatar to Hamas. Today I want to lay out its terms for the American citizens and for the world.
This new proposal has three phases—three. The first phase would last for 6 weeks. Here's what it would include: a full and complete cease-fire; a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza; a release of a number of hostages—including women, the elderly, the wounded—in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. There are American hostages who would be released at this stage, and we want them home.
Additional, some remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families, bringing some degree of closure to their terrible grief.
Palestinians—civilians—would return to their homes and neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza, including in the north. Humanitarian assistance would surge with 600 trucks carrying aid into Gaza every single day.
With a cease-fire, that aid could be safely and effectively distributed to all who need it. Hundreds of thousands of temporary shelters, including housing units, would be delivered by the international community.
All that and more would begin immediately—immediately.
During the 6 weeks of phase one, Israel and Hamas would negotiate the necessary arrangements to get to phase two, which is a permanent end to hostilities.
Now, I'll be straight with you. There are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two. Israel will want to make sure its interests are protected.
But the proposal says if the negotiations take longer than 6 weeks for phase one, the cease-fire will still continue as long as negotiations continue.
And the United States, Egypt, and Qatar would work to ensure negotiations keep going—all agreements—all agreements—until all the agreements are reached and phase two is able to begin.
Then phase two: There would be an exchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers; Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza; and as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments, a temporary cease-fire would become, in the words of the proposal—the Israeli proposal, ""the cessation of hostilities permanently,"" end of quote. ""Cessation of hostilities permanently.""
Finally, in phase three, a major reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence. And any final remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families.
That's the offer that's now on the table and what we've been asking for. It's what we need.
The people of Israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they've devastated Hamas form—forces over the past 8 months. At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another October 7, which is one of the Israelis' main objective in this war and, quite frankly, a righteous one.
I know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some—some—are even in the Government coalition. And they've made it clear: They want to occupy Gaza, they want to keep fighting for years, and the hostages are not a priority to them. Well, I've urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes.
And to the people of Israel, let me say this. As someone whose had a lifelong commitment to Israel, as the only American President who has ever gone to Israel in a time of war, as someone who just sent the U.S. Forces to directly defend Israel when it was attacked by Iran, I ask you to take a step back and think what will happen if this moment is lost.
We can't lose this moment. Indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of ""total victory"" will not bring Israel in—will not bring down—bog down—will only bog down Israel in Gaza, draining the economic, military, and human resources, and furthering Israel's isolation in the world.
That will not bring hostages home. That will not—not—bring an enduring defeat of Hamas. That will not bring Israel lasting security.
But a comprehensive approach that starts with this deal will bring hostages home and will lead to a more secure Israel. And once a cease-fire and hostage deal is concluded, it unlocks the possibility of a great deal more progress, including—including—calm along Israelis' northern border with Lebanon.
The United States will help forge a diplomatic resolution, one that ensures Israel's security and allows people to safely return to their homes without fear of being attacked.
With the deal, a rebuilding of Gaza will begin [with; White House correction] Arab nations and the international community, along with Palestinian and Israeli leaders, to get it done in a manner that does not allow Hamas to re-arm.
And the United States will work with our partners to rebuild homes, schools, and hospitals in Gaza to help repair communities that were destroyed in the chaos of war.
And with this deal, Israel could become more deeply integrated into the region, including—it's no surprise to you all—including no—a potential historic normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia. Israel could be part of a regional security network to counter the threat posed by Iran.
All of this progress would make Israel more secure, with Israeli families no longer living in the shadow of a terrorist attack.
And all of this would create the conditions for a different future and a better future for the Palestinian people, one of self-determination, dignity, security, and freedom. This path is available once the deal is struck.
Israel will always have the right to defend itself against the threats to its security and to bring those responsible for October 7 to justice. And the United States will always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself.
If Hamas fails to fulfill its commitments under the deal, Israel can resume military operations. But Egypt and Qatar have assured me and they are continuing to work to ensure that Hamas doesn't do that. And the United States will help ensure that Israel lives up to their obligations as well.
That's what this deal says. That's what it says. And we'll do our part.
This is truly a decisive moment. Israel has made their proposal. Hamas says it wants a cease-fire. This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it.
Hamas needs to take the deal. For months, people all over the world have called for a cease-fire. Now it's time to raise your voices and to demand that Hamas come to the table, agrees to this deal, and ends this war that they began.
Of course, there will be differences on the specific details that need to be worked out. That's natural. If Hamas comes to negotiate ready to deal, then Israeli negotiations must be given a mandate, the necessary flexibility to close that deal.
The past 8 months have marked heartbreaking pain: pain of those whose loved ones were slaughtered by Hamas terrorists on October 7; hostages and their families waiting in anguish; ordinary Israelis whose lives were forever marked by the shattering event of Hamas's sexual violence and ruthless brutality.
And the Palestinian people have endured sheer hell in this war. Too many innocent people have been killed, including thousands of children. Far too many have been badly wounded.
We all saw the terrible images from the deadly fire in Rafah earlier this week following an Israeli strike against—targeting Hamas. And even as we work to surge assistance to Gaza, with 1,800 trucks delivering supplies these last 5 days—1,800—the humanitarian crisis still remains.
I know this is a subject on which people in this country feel deep, passionate convictions. And so do I. This has been one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world. There's nothing easy about this—nothing easy about it.
Through it all though, the United States has worked relentlessly to support Israelis' security, to get humanitarian supplies into Gaza, and to get a cease-fire and a hostage deal to bring this war to an end. Yesterday, with this new initiative, we've taken an important step in that direction.
And I want to level with you today as to where we are and what might be possible. But I need your help. Everyone who wants peace now must raise their voices and let the leaders know they should take this deal; work to make it real, make it lasting; and forge a better future out of the tragic terror attack and war.
It's time to begin this new stage, for the hostages to come home, for Israel to be secure, for the suffering to stop. It's time for this war to end and for the day after to begin.
Thank you very much.

"Jun 04, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-border-security-and-exchange-with-reporters-0,Remarks on Border Security and an Exchange With Reporters,"""The President. Good afternoon.
I've come here today to do what the Republicans in Congress refuse to do: take the necessary steps to secure our border.
Four months ago, after weeks of intense negotiation between my staff and Democrats and Republicans, we came to a clear—clear—bipartisan deal that was the strongest border security agreement in decades. But then Republicans in Congress—not all, but—walked away from it.
Why? Because Donald Trump told them to. He told the Republicans—it has been published widely by many of you—that he didn't want to fix the issue; he wanted to use it to attack me. That's what he wanted to do. It was a cynical and a—extremely cynical political move and a complete disservice to the American people, who are looking for us to—not to weaponize the border, but to fix it.
Today I'm joined by a bipartisan group of Governors, Members of Congress, mayors, law enforcement officials, most of whom live and work along the southern border. They know the border is not a political issue to be weaponized—the responsibility we have to share to do something about it. They don't have time for the games played in Washington, and neither do the American people.
So today I'm moving past Republican obstruction and using the executive authorities available to me as President to do what I can on my own to address the border.
Frankly, I would have preferred to address this issue through a bipartisan legislation, because that's the only way to actually get the kind of system we have now—that's broken—fixed, to hire more Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, more judges. But Republicans have left me with no choice.
Today I'm announcing actions to bar migrants who cross our southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum. Migrants will be restricted from receiving asylum at our southern border unless they seek it after entering through an established lawful process.
And those who seek—come to the United States legally—for example, by making an appointment and coming to a port of entry—asylum will still be available to them—still available. But if an individual chooses not to use our legal pathways, if they choose to come without permission and against the law, they'll be restricted from receiving asylum and staying in the United States.
This action will help us gain control of our border and restore order to the process. This ban will remain in place until the number of people trying to enter illegally is reduced to a level that our system can effectively manage. We'll carry out this order consistent with all our responsibilities under international law, every one of them.
In addition to this action, we recently made important reforms in our asylum system: more efficient and more secure reforms. The goal is to deliver decisions on asylum as quickly as possible.
The quicker the decision—the quicker decision means that a migrant is less likely to pay a criminal smuggler thousands of dollars to take them on a dangerous journey, knowing that if in fact they move in the wrong direction, they'd be turned around quickly.
And 2 weeks ago, the Department of Justice stated—started a new docket in the immigration courts to address cases where people who've recently crossed the border and make—they'll make a decision within 6 months rather than 6 years, because that's what happens now.
Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security has proposed new rules to allow Federal law enforcement to more quickly remove asylum seekers that have criminal convictions and remove them from the United States.
My administration is also—recently launched new efforts to go after criminal networks that profit from smuggling migrants to our border and incentivize people to give tips to law enforcement to provide information that brings smugglers to justice.
We're also sending additional Federal prosecutors to hot spots along the border and prosecute individuals who break our immigration laws.
One other critical step that we are—we'll be taking, and that is—made a huge difference: We continue to work closely with our Mexican neighbors instead of attacking Mexico, and it's worked.
We built a strong partnership of trust between the Mexican President, López Obrador, and I'm going to do the same with the Mexican-elect President, who I spoke with yesterday.
We've chosen to work together with Mexico as an equal partner, and the facts are clear. Due to the arrangements that I've reached with President Obrador, the number of migrants coming and shared—to our shared border unlawfully in recent months has dropped dramatically.
But while these steps are important, they're not enough. To truly secure the border, we have to change our laws, and Congress needs to provide the necessary funding to hire 1,500 more border security agents; 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backlog of cases, more than 2 million of them; 4,300 more asylum officers to make decisions in less than 6 months instead of 6 years, which is what it takes now; and around 100 more high-tech detection machines to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop fentanyl being smuggled into the United States.
These investments were one of the primary reasons that the Border Patrol union endorsed the bipartisan deal in the first place. And these investments are essential and remain essential.
As far as I'm concerned, if you're not willing to spend the money to hire more Border Patrol agents, more asylum officers, more judges, more high-tech machinery, you're just not serious about protecting our border. It's just as simple as that.
I believe that immigration has always been a lifeblood of America. We're constantly renewed by an infusion of people with—and new talent. The Statue of Liberty is not some relic of American history. It stands for who we are as the United States.
So I will never demonize immigrants. I will never refer to immigrants as ""poisoning the blood"" of a country. And further, I'll never separate children from their families at the border.
I will not ban people from this country because of their religious beliefs. I will not use the U.S. military to go into neighborhoods all across the country to pull millions of people out of their homes and away from their families to put detention camps and await—while awaiting deportation, as my predecessor says he will do if he occupies this office again.
On my first—very first day as President, I introduced a comprehensive immigration reform plan to fix—to fix—our broken system, secure our border, provide a pathway for citizenship for ""Dreamers,"" and a lot more. And I'm still fighting to get that done.
But we must face a simple truth: To protect America as a land that welcomes immigrants, we must first secure the border and secure it now.
The simple truth is, there is a worldwide migrant crisis, and if the United States doesn't secure our border, there is no limit to the number of people who may try to come here, because there is no better place on the planet than the United States of America.
For those who say the steps I've taken are too strict, I say to you that—be patient, and good will of the American people are going to wear—are wearing thin right now. Doing nothing is not an option. We have to act. We must act consistent with both our law and our values—our value as Americans.
I'll take these steps today not to walk away from we—who we are as Americans, but to make sure we preserve who we are for future generations to come.
Today I've spoken about what we need to do to secure the border. In the weeks ahead—and I mean the weeks ahead—I will speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just.
Let's fix the problem and stop fighting about it. I'm doing my part. We're doing our part. congressional Republicans should do their part.
Thank you very much.

Mr. President, dear Joe; Madam First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden.
[At this point, President Macron spoke briefly in English as follows.]
I want to reassure you, it's just a toast and not a speech—[laughter]—so I will be very short.
[President Macron continued in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, my wife and myself are very honored to be hosting you today here at the Élysée with all of your delegation and all of our guests, because every time there is an occasion to celebrate that brings together Americans and French people, the spirit of 1776 is never far, conjuring what is best in both of our countries.
These warm feelings borne of a long and deep friendship is further enhanced by the joy today of hosting you today for your first official state visit to France with a very pleasant feeling of déjà vu. Indeed, a year and a half ago, you were hosting me in Washington in December 2022, thus demonstrating through regular visits how close we are in the reciprocal interests of our countries.
And this year, 2024, for all people who are attached to the Franco relations—Franco-American relationship, there is something special to celebrate because there is a reciprocal sacrifice for our independence, for our freedom.
Indeed, this year, we will celebrate the 200th anniversary of the farewell tour of the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolution. I know that he is close to the hearts of all Americans.
We also commemorate the 80th anniversary of the landings in Normandy and in Provence. We stood side by side then, as we did 2 days ago in Normandy for the ceremonies on June 6, to bow our heads in the peaceful cemetery of Colleville to remember their courage on the Omaha Beach—Omaha the bloody—where so many of your countrymen gave their lives for a country they had never been to before.
Never will we forget these heroes who, from Normandy to Berlin, helped to free a continent and our country. Their sacrifice has cemented our friendship.
Amongst these heroes, there was a young man, Harold Terens. He was 18 when Pearl Harbor happened. At the age of 20, he was a radio operator working with your Air Force. He was at his duty post on D-Day, and then the war led him everywhere in France, in Morocco, and all the way to Ukraine.
Today Harold has chosen our country to marry Jeanne Swerlin. They are with us today, and they are just making their marriage vows, so let us congratulate the young newlyweds. We're very pleased to be here for your wedding repast.
On this foundation, so many relations have developed—from cinema to music, from literature to space, from energy to transport, agriculture and health—so many partnerships that have served to consolidate our bilateral relationship and that we have further strengthened recently.
It's also this relation that make it possible to affirm our values faced with a war of aggression by Russia in Ukraine or today in the Middle East in Gaza, and once again, thank you for the initiative that you have just taken and that we support to be united in spite of our differences when the main values are at stake. This is what is our—lie across the Atlantic.
When it comes to defending our values, we stand together, so, of course, there's something a bit special in our relationship, because you are—you're American; we are French. And there's something of a mutual fascination you find from Tocqueville all the way to Miller or, indeed, in our respective film industries.
We love the American Dream, and you like the French art de vivre, the French lifestyle. And we tend to be maybe defending our singularities, but we love each other for what we are. And this applies to each and every one of us.
And when I—we see the affection that you have for France, the way in which you have been prepared to attend the Olympic and Paralympic Games, I can see that more than ever you remain your best allies. United we stand, divided we fall—this is enshrined in the very name of your country. This should be the philosophy that should inspire us, that inspired the Greatest Generation to which you paid tribute yesterday at Pointe du Hoc. And indeed, that is what binds us together today.
We are allies. We will remain allies. And these are the values which 80 years down the road keep us together.
And this is why, Mr. President, dear Joe, dear Jill, it is such an honor to have you here in France on the occasion of this state visit that is an opportunity to celebrate the untrammeled vitality of our alliance and this very special relationship between our two nations and, indeed, our love for freedom.
If I may, I would like to propose a toast to the United States of America, to France, and, indeed, to the friendship between the United States and France.
[President Macron offered a toast.]
President Biden. Mr. President, Brigitte, distinguished guests.
You know, one of the things that's been a legend in my family is my middle name is Robinette. And allegedly, I've never—I've been told by my grandfather that this was established—I have not found it yet; maybe someone could help me—that I'm a son of the American Revolution, because Robinette came over with Lafayette and never went home. He stayed in the United States.
So that makes me a son of the American Revolution. And—but I haven't been able to establish that yet. So maybe one of your genealogists can figure it out for me.
Look, the—your—France is our first ally. And that's not insignificant. The fact of the matter is you were with us to help us secure our freedom, and we were with you 170 years later——
[President Biden cleared his throat.]
Excuse me—to do the same. And ever since, we've remained united, unyielding, as well as unwavering in our partnership.
That's what democracies do. That has been an extraordinary week here for us, for Jill and me. It's just been amazing to be here. I've been here a number of times over the years. I know I don't look it, but I'm only 40 years old. [Laughter] But, all kidding aside, been here many times, but this has been the most remarkable trip that I've ever made.
Together, we celebrated D-Day, the heroes of D-Day, and told the story of the alliance and how, together, we saved Europe. And the people of France two—and two—and you two, personally, honored our veterans with such warmth and dignity.
On behalf of all the American people, we want to say thank you, thank you, thank you from the bottom of our heart. I mean it.
When the American troops came to these shores 80 years ago on an audacious mission to save the continent, they each carried a book given to them by the U.S. military. And the book was called ""A Pocket Guide to France."" Seriously.
It included helpful hints like this: ""No bragging; the French don't like it."" [Laughter] Not a joke. ""Be generous; it won't hurt you."" ""Avoid controversial topics, even if you took French in high school."" [Laughter]
And try to follow at least one—I tried my best to follow at least one of those. But you know—and then it said the French are allies who, quote—to quote: ""happen to speak democracy in a different language. And we democracies aren't just doing favors; we're fighting for each other when history goes—gets through. We all are in the same boat,"" end of quote.
France and the United States have always been there for one another. We stand together when the going gets tough, and that's a fact.
We stand together to defend the values that lie at the soul, the very soul of both our nations, and I believe that to be the case today: liberty, equality, brotherhood. Generation after generation, people across both our nations have upheld these ideals because they know, when we stand as one, our countries are stronger and, literally, the world is safer.
Emmanuel, you've heard me say it before. We stand at an inflection point in history. The decisions we make now will determine the course of our future for decades to come.
We have a lot of opportunity, but a lot of responsibility. And it gives me hope to know France and the United States stand together now and always, or as the ""Pocket Guide to France"" given to the invading Americans might say, ""We're rowing in the same boat.""
Ladies and gentlemen, to France, the United States, and to our people, may we continue to seek democracy. May we—in both our languages. And may we always stay together.
It's been a great honor to be here. And I want to thank you. I'm going to raise my glass.
[President Biden offered a toast.]

13. They reaffirmed their determination to increase pressure on Iran to curb its destabilizing regional activities, nuclear escalation and missile proliferation, halt its support to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, secure its full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and pave the way for a future negotiated solution that ensures its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. They stand ready to adopt further sanctions and take other measures to counter Iranian destabilising activities and to prevent transfers of Iranian missiles to Russia.

They stress the importance of international discussions on AI governance and their interoperability, given the global economic potential and social impacts of this technological revolution. In doing so, France and the United States recognize the importance of promoting safe, secure, and trustworthy AI in line with a risk-based, human-centric and innovation-friendly approach. In particular, they reiterate their commitment to work together in the G7 to advance the International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems. This will include a reporting framework to foster accountability in the development of advanced AI systems and to understand the extent to which the Code of Conduct is encouraging improved security and risk management practices.
25. They commend cooperation via the Global Partnership on AI with 29 members from all geographies. They support the ambition to strengthen the mandate of the Partnership, meant to become an inclusive forum to both engage in joint research projects of public interest and support meaningful discussions among partners on standards and interoperability of their respective AI regulations. In particular, they underline the need for close cooperation on AI technical standards to ensure the safe and trustworthy development of AI systems. The United States intends to participate in the AI Action Summit in France in 2025, and contribute to its preparation as part of the steering committee, with a view to promoting safe, secure and trustworthy AI at the service of the general interest and economic and social prosperity for all regions of the world.

26. As France and the United States continue to enhance their cooperation regarding the promotion of critical and emerging technologies, they continue to acknowledge that certain of these technologies have implications for global peace and security. To this end, France and the United States have a shared objective of ensuring our technology ecosystems cannot be exploited to undermine international peace and security.

France and the United States call for scaled up efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, in a deep, timely, and sustained manner, during this critical decade to keep our goal of limiting the temperature increase to 1.5C alive. Together, they are committed to submitting new and ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions with absolute reduction targets, covering all sectors and categories of the economy and all greenhouse gases, including methane by February 2025, as well as revising their long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies towards just transitions to net zero emissions, as required by the Paris Agreement and the outcome of the first Global Stocktake (GST). France and the United States reiterate the need to reach a 75% reduction in global methane emissions from fossil fuels, including by reducing methane emissions intensity of oil and gas operations by 2030, leveraging instruments like the International Methane Emissions Observatory, the Global Methane Pledge and national instruments. They committed to continue robust bilateral coordination on climate negotiations through regular meetings.
31. Recognizing the key role of nuclear energy as a clean/zero-emissions energy source in achieving global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, both France and the United States reiterate their endorsement of the declaration to triple nuclear energy capacity globally by 2050, which they launched along with more than 20 other countries from four continents at COP28, and welcome additional endorsers in advance of COP29.
32. They express their intention to achieve meaningful results at COP29 and COP30, including on climate finance and the implementation of the GST's ""1.5-degree roadmap,"" as well as building upon the COP28 pledges to triple renewable energy capacity globally and double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030, through companion efforts such as increasing total energy storage and grids expansion, turning this added renewable capacity into baseload power.
33. France and the United States emphasize the urgency to effectively, concretely, and rapidly implement the CMA.5 GST decision, including on the transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems in a just, orderly, and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050. They recalled the commitment of the G7 to phase out existing unabated coal power generation in our energy systems during the first half of 2030s and make intensive efforts to reduce demand for and use of fossil fuels.
34. France and the United States welcome the OECD confirmation that developed countries fully met their goal of jointly mobilizing 100 billion USD per year for climate action in developing countries for the first time in 2022, and expressed the need for an ambitious new collective quantified goal, set from a floor of USD 100 billion per year, which contributes to keep 1.5°C within reach, and build a net-zero GHG emissions and climate resilient future.
35. They will continue to support developing and emerging economies through such measures as implementation of partnerships like the Just Energy Transition Partnerships and climate finance, particularly increased use of blended finance and mobilizing private finance. This will include a joint initiative to encourage multilateral development banks to explore their potential role in nuclear energy financing and technical assistance, according to each bank's capacity and comparative advantages. They will continue their efforts to make finance flows consistent with with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions gas and climate-resilient development.

"Jun 08, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-members-the-press-with-president-emmanuel-macron-france-paris-france,"Remarks to Members of the Press With President Emmanuel Macron of France in Paris, France","""President Biden. It's beautiful.
President Macron. Mr. President, dear Joe, ladies and gentlemen, Ambassadors, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. President, you are honoring us with a state visit to France after—your presence and that of your wife, Dr. Jill Biden, after the 80th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. And I believe your veterans, our veterans, and those of all the Allies were honored by your presence and that of other leaders on the 6th of June and by the warm welcome they enjoyed while they were there.
But this says a lot about the strength of our alliance and what binds France and the United States of America. This is a unity of blood, shed to address the great challenges of the day, but it is this bloodline that is the connection between our two flags, our two nations. So, once again, thank you for your presence.
Together with the President, we discussed the great issues that we are facing, the first of which being Ukraine. Today, in Ukraine, men and women are fighting with remarkable courage, determined not to give in faced with the Russian aggression, the unjustifiable aggression. Jointly, we responded to extend our support to this European nations, which is fighting for its survival and its freedom, and we will continue to this as intensely and as long as is necessary.
And I would like to thank you, sir, for the commitment of the United States of America and the recent decisions you've recently confirmed whereby you came to our sides and played a critical role in this conflict. This conflict is all about the security and stability of Old Europe.
Many thanks again. And I think we see eye to eye on this war raging in Ukraine. We took joint decisions authorizing Ukraine to fight back, strike its aggressor when defending its territory. We are, of course, making great efforts to arm, train, equip the Ukrainian army.
And we made remarkable decisions. We mentioned the—well, the details of the war, as I said, raging out there. But during the G-7, we hope—both hope that all members of the G-7 will agree to a 50 billion solidarity fund for Ukraine. And, in the peace conference in Switzerland, you will be represented there. This will be a critical stage as well. And of course, the NATO summit in Washington, DC.
As regards the Ukrainian issue, as I said, we do see eye to eye: respect for international law, the freedom of peoples to determine their own future to self-determination. And thank you for being at Europe's side.
This close cooperation between France and the United States concerns other crises as well. There should be no dual standards, and although there are many crises around the world, we're still applying the self-same principles with the self-same determination.
In Gaza, we want to obtain the immediate liberation of hostages, and we can only welcome the liberation of four hostages by the Israeli army.
We want to achieve the immediate cease-fire and open up the prospect of a political solution, which is the only one that can bring about a fair and lasting peace and meet the security of concerns of both people. And that is why we are supporting the comprehensive proposal of the United States of America.
After 9 months of conflict, the situation in Rafah and the human consequences are unacceptable. It is not acceptable that Israel should not open all checkpoints to humanitarian aid as requested by the united—international community for months.
Operations—Israeli operations should stop there, and the United Nations Security Council has a role to play. But of course, jointly, we will double down to avoid a regional escalation, in particular, in Lebanon, where we are working on deescalation on the Blue Line and on the institutional aspect in both countries, working with both—and indeed, all—stakeholders to assure that all parties come back to their senses.
Regarding Iran, we know the same thing. There is an all-out escalation: unprecedented attacks against Israel, operations of regional destabilization, and, of course, the Iranian nuclear program.
Both our countries are determined to bring pressure to bear to counter this trend. And this was demonstrated recently enough, a few days ago, by jointly adopting a resolution at the International Atomic Energy Agency. The self-same determination is there. We do not wish to apply double standards.
And that is why we coordinate our efforts in Africa, the crisis in Sudan, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, throughout the region.
And, over and beyond this, our two countries, with a mean sense of leadership, will address the challenges of our time, especially those touching the most vulnerable countries. We do wish to achieve a fairer international order. That is the meaning of the Paris Pact for the People and the Planet, but also initiatives for a more efficient tax system.
We are stepping up the exit from the coal—from coal energy. There will be the conference on the ocean. And indeed, we are mobilizing efforts on global health. And indeed, we will be both involved in organizing the Gavi conference here in Paris. That is also what lies behind this proposition of an Olympic Truce, which was proposed by the U.N. just a few days ago.
On the economic front, we are both concerned about China's unfair trade practices, which bring about overcapacity. This is of such importance for the global economy that we have to act in a coordinated fashion.
During my visit in December '22, I explained the consequences of the Inflation Reduction Act on the European economy. We discussed this again. That piece of legislation is useful because it makes it possible—indeed, it steps up the decarbonization of the American economy and, therefore, the implementation of the Paris Agreements.
But of course, we want to reset, as it were, both our economies—that is the European economy and the—that of the United States of America—in terms of regulation, investment, and on such issues as clean tech, artificial intelligence, and indeed, agrifood issues.
But of course, we want to work on the bilateral level for better cooperation. American students, American scientists, American entrepreneurs are more than welcome in this country. We wish there would be more of them.
We also have cooperation based, since the state visit of December 2022, around the civilian nuclear industry.
In the space industry, we want to go further. Indeed, a number of agreements were signed between CNES and NASA on Earth observation or, indeed, the Artemis program.
And also proud to announce that the first high-speed—American high-speed train, built by Alstom, will be commissioned in the United States by year's end. And that is also a sign of increased cooperation between our railroad industries, and this is a sign of economical cooperation, but also a step towards the energy transition resorting to France's technological excellence.
I would also like to signal the importance of American investors in France. There was the Choose France Summit in France. France will start a new foundation worth 100 million euros to promote university exchanges and exchange programs of research between our two countries. I would like to thank the companies that joined this. In particular, CMA-CGM was very much involved.
This new initiative comes after the success of the Villa Albertine project, where several cities in your country received as many as 180 creators and intellectuals in a matter of 2 years in about 50 cities.
I shan't speak longer.
But I would like to say that—regarding the wars around the world inflicting pain around the world on big international issues and on the bilateral front—together with President Biden, we want to have a joint roadmap. We need to trust in the future, trust in progress, trust in innovation, the determination to create jobs not just in the U.S., but in Europe as well. We want to be there when the economy is properly decarbonized, but we want to build peace.
We mustn't be naive. We must be on the side of those who resist. We must not be naive. In other words, we need to find demanding solutions.
But I would like to thank you, Mr. President, to be not—the President not just of the first—of the greatest world power, but you being clear and loyal partner who respects Europeans and who wants to build on these agreements from the Ukraine to the Middle East, through what we're taking up today on the economic front.
Thank you. Thank you for being with us today. And thank you for honoring Paris, Normandy, and France during the celebrations with your state visit.
Thank you.
President Biden. Well, Mr. President, thank you. It's been a great honor to be here, not only the Normandy events, but it was a moving experience for a student of French history to be—the Champs-Élysées today. I—it was a moving experience for us, for the whole delegation.
You know, France was our first friend and remains our—one of our best friends. This week, we reaffirmed that friendship in a deeply meaningful way.
But, before I begin my remarks, I want to echo President Macron's comments welcoming the safe rescue of four hostages that were returned to their families in Israel. We won't stop working until all the hostages come home and a cease-fire is reached. That is essential to happen.
You know, together we marked the 80th anniversary of the Allied operation that saved Europe and an—incredible heroes who carried it out. I found it—180 brave men—happened to be all men at the time—who came back to Normandy this week with such pride and sense of devotion. I don't think anyone who got to meet them, shake their hands, or hear their stories will ever forget their stories or the look in their eyes and the pride they took with what they did. But you could also see they were remembering the lost comrades at the same time. You know, the fact is that I know I won't forget it.
And I want to thank President Macron, Mrs. Macron for—and the people of France for making our heroes feel so welcome, because they did feel welcome. You could feel it. You could see it. And we'll never forget—we'll never forget—what they did.
And this week, we have showed the world once again the power of allies and what we can achieve when we stand together. That's what this relationship between France and the United States exemplifies.
You know, we see it in Ukraine, where our two countries are standing with the Ukrainian people as they fight off Putin's brutal aggression. And yesterday I announced $225 million in new security assistance to Ukraine. And it's the sixth package we've provided since we signed the national security legislation earlier this year—I wish we could have done it when we wanted to 6 months earlier, but we got it done—with $61 billion in additional aid to Ukraine.
And I commend France and our European allies for their leadership as well. The EU has proved that—provided over a—107 billion—$107 billion in assistance to Ukraine since the war began, because we know what happens if Putin succeeds in subjugating Ukraine, and it won't—we won't stop—you know—you know, Putin not going to stop at Ukraine. It's not just Ukraine; it's about much more than Ukraine. All of Europe will be threatened, but we're not going to let that happen.
The United States is standing strong with Ukraine. We're standing with our allies. And we're standing with France. We will not—we will not—say it again—walk away.
And around the world, France and the United States are working together to strengthen security and shared prosperity. In the Indo-Pacific, we stand together for freedom of navigation, transparent governments, as well as fair economic practices. In the Middle East and North Africa, we work together on issues critical to peace and stability, like food security and counterterrorism.
And the existential threat of climate change, which is just growing greater, we're working together to accelerate the global transition to net-zero. It is the existential threat to humanity, among—the only existential threat to humanity, including nuclear weapons, is if we do nothing on climate change. I could go on.
Every day, the French people and the American people are connected in countless ways through economic ties, collaboration in science and technology, educational exchanges.
The reason we don't have more Americans coming, we were afraid they won't come home. [Laughter] It's such a beautiful—I mean it. This is such an incredible country, such a beautiful country.
And you know, the fact is that these cherished ties between our families and friends continues to grow. The bonds between our nations are strong, vast, and rooted in the most important element: shared values. That's true today, as it's been from the very start.
In a few weeks, the United States will celebrate the Fourth of July, our day of independence. That feat would not have been possible—it's not hyperbole—would not have been possible were it not for France coming to our aid.
We're the—we're a nation because of France, in large part. You stepped up when we needed help, and you did it. That's what the Fourth of July is about. That feat would not have been possible, again, without your support, without France's support.
Today I proudly stand with France to support freedom and democracy around the world. That's what this spectacular week is all about.
Mr. President, there is much more we had the chance to talk about. We're going to continue to talk. You've become a good friend, and I really appreciate your cooperation and your insights.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
President Macron. Merci beaucoup. Thank you, President.
President Biden. Thank you.
Q. Mr. President, can you give us an update on the Russian assets? Did you discuss that today?"""
"Jun 13, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-savelletri-di,"The President's News Conference With President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine in Savelletri di Fasano, Italy","""[Prior to their remarks, President Biden and President Zelenskyy signed a joint statement titled ""Bilateral Security Agreement Between the United States of America and Ukraine.""]
President Biden. Good evening, everyone.
Last year, at the NATO summit in Lithuania, the United States brought together every member of the G-7 to sign a joint declaration of support for Ukraine. Twenty-five additional countries joined us quickly. Each agreed to forge a long-term bilateral commitments to—with Ukraine.
President Zelenskyy and I have just now signed that agreement between the United States and Ukraine. Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine's credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term. A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime in the future.
The United States is going to help ensure that Ukraine can do both, not by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine, but by providing weapons and ammunition; expanding intelligence-sharing; continuing to train brave Ukrainian troops at bases in Europe and the United States; enhancing interoperability between our militaries in line with NATO standards; investing in Ukraine's defense industrial base so in time—in time—they can supply their own weapons and munitions; working with Ukraine's partners to build a future force that is strong, sustainable, and resilient; and supporting Ukraine's economic recovery as well as its energy recovery after Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy grid with massive attacks in the futile attempt to break the will of the Ukrainian people. All these lines of efforts and others are laid out in this agreement.
Additionally, the G-7 achieved a significant outcome this week on the matter of Russia's frozen assets in Europe and other places outside of Russia. Back in 2022, 2 days after Russia's invasion, members of the G-7 and the European Union worked together to freeze $280 billion in Russian Central Bank funds outside of Russia.
I'm very pleased to share that, this week—this week—the G-7 signed a plan to finalize and unlock $50 billion from the proceeds of those frozen assets, to put that money to work for Ukraine. Another reminder to Putin: We're not backing down. In fact, we're standing together against this illegal aggression.
The agreement that President Zelenskyy and I just signed also lays out our shared vision for a just peace, a peace rooted in the U.N. Charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, a peace with a broad base of support around the world that holds Russia accountable for the damage it has done in this war.
We will see this vision strongly affirmed at the historic peace conference happening in Switzerland this weekend, where Vice President Harris will represent the United States.
Finally, this agreement accelerates Ukraine's integration into the European and Atlantic—trans-Atlantic communities. It includes major commitments from Ukraine to impact—and to—excuse me—to implement democratic, economic, and security reforms in line with the European Union's accession goals and NATO's programs of reforms.
While we take this step, the United States is also intensifying pressure on Russia. Yesterday the U.S. Treasury Department made clear any bank anywhere in the world that deals with sanctioned Russian banks, companies, or individuals risks being sanctioned themselves.
And we announced roughly 300 new sanctions on individuals and companies that are helping Russia's war effort. They include key parts of Russia's financial sector——
[At this point, an aircraft could be heard overhead.]
I'll wait until it goes over—as well as individual and entities that supply Russia with items critical to its defense production, like microelectronics, machine tools, and industrial materials.
We also—we also—sanctioned more Russian future energy projects that—Russia's natural gas and oil projects that are under construction and are not yet fully operating. Putin is counting on revenues from those projects. Our sanctions will disrupt those plans.
Plus, at the G-7, we discussed our shared concern about countries like China who are supplying Russia with materials they need for their war machine. And we agreed to taking collective action to push back against that activity.
Let me close with this. We've taken three major steps at the G-7 that collectively show Putin we cannot—he cannot wait us out, he cannot divide us, and we'll be with Ukraine until they prevail in this war.
First is the bilateral security agreement just signed. Second, a historic agreement to provide $50 billion in value from Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine. And third, an agreement to ensure our sanctions efforts disrupt third countries that are supplying Russia's war efforts. That will increase pressure on the Russian economy.
Collectively, this is a powerful set of actions, and it will create a stronger foundation for Ukraine's success.
Two and a half years ago, Putin unleashed a brutal war on Ukraine. And it's been a horrifying ordeal for the Ukrainian people that are so brave and incredible. It's also been a test for the world: Would we stand with Ukraine? Would we stand for sovereignty, freedom, and against tyranny?
The United States, the G-7, and countries around the world have consistently answered the question by saying, ""Yes, we will."" And we will say it again. Yes, again and again and again, we're going to stand with Ukraine.
And thank you. And I now yield to my friend from Ukraine, the President.
[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]
President Zelenskyy. Thank you so much, Mr. President Biden, dear President; dear journalists; dear Ukrainians; dear Americans. And thank you so much. Thanks, Italy and Giorgia, to—for an invitation.
Dear friends, today is a truly historic day. And we have signed the strongest agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. since our independence. And this is an agreement on security and thus on the protection of human life. This is an agreement on cooperation and thus on how our nations will become stronger. This is an agreement on steps to guarantee sustainable peace, and therefore, it benefits everyone in the world because the Russian war against Ukraine is a real, real global threat.
I thank you very much, Mr. President, for your leadership, which is reflected, in particular, in this agreement and in your years of support for Ukraine. I thank our teams—both teams. Thanks very much for making sure that the details of the agreement are really good.
And of course, I want to thank every Ukrainian soldier, all our people, whose courage made this level of alliance between Ukraine and the United States possible.
And I am proud of our people and what Ukraine can do. And I am very grateful to all Americans, to everyone in America who strengthens American leadership.
So, under the points of the agreement, first, the agreement contains a very detailed, legally binding part, and this means that credibility of American support for our Ukrainian independence.
Secondly, security commitments from the United States are based, among other things, on the sustainability of security and defense support not only for the duration of this war, but also—also—for the period of peace after the war. And we will definitely ensure peace.
Third, it clearly states that America supports Ukraine's efforts to win this war.
Fourth, the agreement has good provisions on weapons for our defense, very specifically on the Patriot systems, very specifically on the supply of fighter squadrons to Ukraine—that's right, plural ""squadrons""—including, but not limited to F-16s. We have worked for a long time for these.
The agreement is also very specific about the supply of the necessary weapons, joint production, and strengthening of the defense industries of our countries through our cooperation. And this is something that will not only provide security, but also new, good jobs for Ukrainians and Americans.
The agreement also outlines what is needed in terms of intelligence information. The agreement contains key aspects of protecting the lives of our people.
Fifth, it is very important that the agreement also addresses the issue of Russia's just responsibility for this war and its attempts to destroy Ukrainians. America supports both fair compensation for the damage caused by Russian strikes and working out ways to ensure that frozen Russian assets are used to protect and rebuild Ukraine.
The agreement also includes sanctions and export controls that will make Russia feel the pain for what it is doing against the freedom of peoples.
And two more things. I am grateful that the philosophy of our security agreement is, in fact, the philosophy of the alliance. And that is why the issue of NATO is covered through the text of the agreement. It states that America supports Ukraine's future—future—membership in NATO and recognizes that our security agreement is a bridge to Ukraine's membership in NATO.
It is very important for all Ukrainians and for all Europeans to know that there will be no security deficit in Europe, which tempts the aggressor to war and makes the future uncertain.
Now we are clearly defining everything. We will cooperate for the sake of victory, make peace guarantees effective, and provide the necessary security for our people.
And thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership in the G-7's decision on $50 billion loan for Ukraine. It's a vital step forward in providing sustainable support for Ukraine in winning this war.
Russian immobilized assets should be used for defending lives of Ukrainians from Russian terror and for repaying the damage aggressor caused to Ukraine. It's fair and absolutely right.
Mr. President, thank you, your team. I would also like to thank the United States Congress for their support: both parties, both Chambers.
Thank you. And thanks to every American heart that does not betray freedom and supports us.
Slava Ukraini.
President Biden. Now what we'll do is—we're each going to take two questions from American reporters and two—a question each from two American reporters and a question each from two Ukrainian supporters—reporters.
The first person I'm to call on is Colleen Long of the Associated Press.
Ukraine/Russia/President Biden's Son R. Hunter Biden 
Q. Thank you. Thanks, Mr. President.
About 2 weeks ago, you changed course to allow Ukraine to fire U.S. weapons into Russia. Given the reported successes, would you consider further expanding the parameters on U.S. weapons into Russia even despite your concerns about escalation?
And on the news from home: You're going through something that so many American families go through—the intersection of addiction and the criminal justice system—but you're not like most families. Was your son able to get a fair trial? Do you believe the Justice Department operated independently of politics?
And for President——
President Biden. Let me answer your question——
Q. Okay.
President Biden. ——then you ask his question. Okay?
Q. Okay.
President Biden. With regard to the first question, it is clear that the near abroad, meaning just across the line of the border with Russia and Ukraine, that it makes a lot of sense for Ukraine to be able to take out or combat what is coming across that border. In terms of long-range weapons—longer range weapons into the interior of Russia, we have not changed our position on that sort.
With regard to the question regarding the family, I'm extremely proud of my son Hunter. He has overcome an addiction. He is—he's one of the brightest, most decent men I know. And I am satisfied that—I'm not going to do anything. I said I'd abide by the jury decision, and I will do that. And I will not pardon him.
Q. President Zelenskyy, a number of leaders here in Italy, including President Biden, are facing upcoming election challenges. How will the security agreement signed tonight and the other promises of support continue if they are not in office? And what's your contingency plan if they don't?
[President Zelenskyy spoke in Ukrainian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter.]
President Zelenskyy. Thank you for this question—[inaudible]. First and foremost, I'd like to thank the people of the nations. First and foremost, to the United States, to the countries in Europe and other—on other continents who have supported us since the very beginning of—the beginning of this absolutely unjust war of Russia against the people of Ukraine.
That—and that is—they—they've been killing people that—homes and territory, all that is very important. It is part of life. But, first and foremost, we are speaking about people and lives of people, you understand. And this war was unjust since the very beginning, the war of this evil, whose name is Putin—the war against the people of Ukraine. And he has killed so many people.
To say that it is not him, and it—there was a military man who did it—the last one is just an instrument of his. And he's playing this instrument.
And therefore, it is important for us that, since the very beginning, we were supported by people, by nations, because they understood that we share common values. We simply want to live, and the people understood. They imagined what will happen if such evil attacks them. And therefore, we were supported by people.
And I thank President Biden and other leaders who, since the very beginning of the invasion—Putin's invasion—started to support us. They—based on their values, they were—based on the voice of their people. And it is impossible without people.
And I am sure that this nation chooses leaders and presidents. And it seems to me that no matter whom the nation chooses, first and foremost, it seems to me that everything depends on the unity within this or that state. And if the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom.
President Biden. Do you want to call on a Ukrainian reporter?
[President Zelenskyy spoke briefly in English as follows.]
President Zelenskyy. Yes, yes. Yes. With pleasure. Thank you so much.
[President Zelenskyy spoke briefly in Ukrainian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Yes, please, Inter. Irina Ivanova, Inter TV channel.
[The reporter spoke in English as follows.]
Ukraine/International Military Aid 
Q. [Inaudible]—for both leaders. So today, during the G-7 meeting, the discussion focused on developing Ukraine's air defense system based on the most advanced Western complexes and also on enhancing long-range capabilities. So my question is, can you provide any details on the initiative and about the readiness of our allies to take part in it? Thank you.
President Biden. I'd be happy to respond to that. We have acquired commitment from five countries so far for Patriot batteries and other air defense systems as well as, we've let it be known to those countries that are expecting from us air defense systems in the future that they're going to have to wait. Everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met. And then we will make good on the commitments we made to other countries.
[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]
President Zelenskyy. I think President Biden already answered your question. Really, he knows and all our other partners, they know that urgently we need seven Patriot systems—yes, to save our cities—not all of them; it's a pity—but urgently seven. And we discussed the possibility of having five of them, it's true. But the partners work on it.
It doesn't mean that tomorrow we will have these five systems, but we see, in the closest future, good result for Ukraine.
President Biden. You'll have some relatively quickly.
American reporter. Josh Winegrove [Wingrove; White House correction], Bloomberg. 
Conflict in Gaza, Palestinian Territories/International Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for Mr.—or President Zelenskyy shortly on the announcements. But if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you about your discussions on the situation in Gaza here at the summit. You were asked just a short time ago about it, after the skydiving demonstration. Can you give us your assessment of Hamas's response? And do you believe that they are trying to work towards a deal, or is this response working against a deal? And what is your message to allies, including those here at the G-7, about what more, if anything, the U.S. can do to drive towards a peace agreement? Thank you.
President Biden. I wish you guys would, a little, play by the rules a little bit.
I'm here to talk about a critical situation in Ukraine. You're asking me another subject; I'll be happy to answer it in detail later. But the bottom line is that we've made an agreement—I've laid out an approach that has been endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, by the G-7, by the Israelis, and the biggest hangup so far is Hamas refusing to sign on even though they have submitted something similar.
Whether it has—now to—comes to fruition remains to be seen. We're going to continue to push. I don't have a final answer for you.
Ukraine/Russia 
Q. And to President Biden's point, a question about today's discussions.
President Zelenskyy, the $50 billion today—you've had the supplemental, of course, from the U.S. Congress recently. Can you give us an assessment of the situation on the battlefield right now? And what has been given now, how long will this get you in terms of either stopping the Russian advance or making headway on this? And how long will it last you if, indeed, future leaders or current leaders are unable to reach consensus on further aid packages?
And President Biden, I'd welcome your assessment of the situation currently on the battlefield and what difference the supplemental has made as well, sir.
Thank you.
[President Zelenskyy spoke in Ukrainian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
President Zelenskyy. Thank you for your question. Indeed, we were expecting the fundamental package of this support was in the Congress of the United States of America. And truly, it was a long pause for our warriors, first and foremost, but it is important, and we are grateful that, in the very end, we have this supplement, and this will for sure strengthen our warriors.
Yes, this has given the opportunity to the enemy within this pause to try to occupy Kharkiv, but that attempt was stopped by our warriors. They were repelled—the enemy was repelled. And we, despite everything, disrupted all their plans. And it seems to me that that is the most important thing.
What this supplement that will arrive gives us: It enables us to fully equip the reserves—those guys, those brigades that are ready—so that they provide for the opportunity to rotate our units on the battlefield so that they can have some rest so that the brigades can regenerate so that other brigades enter the battlefield instead of them with equipment. This is what the supplement gives them.
So the raise of morale, but also the raise of strength of our brigades. And it seems to me that this is the most important.
For how long this will be enough—look, we, without package, have been holding the lines for 8 months, and the Russians had no successes. And therefore, the question on for how long it will be enough—no, I think the question has to be for how long the unity will last: the unity in the
United States together with the European leaders, how these or those elections will influence this unity.
It seems to me that we should look on this exactly this way: to preserve unity, to preserve the integrity of the world—integrity of the democratic world. Because if Ukraine does not withstand, the democracy of many countries will not be able to withstand—and I'm sure of that.
President Biden. By the way, the idea that we had to wait until we passed the legislation overall, being held up by a small majority of our Republican colleagues, was just terrible. And there's a lot more money coming beyond what's already come in the other tranches that are available now that we've passed the legislation. So they'll have what they need and get it there as quickly as we possibly can.
[President Zelenskyy spoke briefly in English as follows.]
President Zelenskyy. Thank you so much, Mr. President.
[President Zelenskyy spoke in Ukrainian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Telegraph, please.

Ukraine/Russia/International Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. Good evening. My name is Yaroslav Zharyenov of Telegraf UA. Thank you for this opportunity. I have a long way from Kyiv and have enough time to prepare such long question. [Laughter]
Firstly, to Joe Biden. Mr. President, the additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act that you signed mandated the submission of strategy war—for the war in Ukraine within 45 days after its enactment.
This deadline passed on June 8. And to now, yet the international community has not seen this strategy. Has it been developed? And if the strategy is classified, what step does your administration plan to take to hasten Ukraine victory in the war?
It's my first question. The second will be to the President Zelenskyy.
President Biden. What was the last part of your question?
Q. Has it been developed, this strategy? And to—what steps does your administration plan to take to victory Ukraine in the war?
President Biden. The steps we're going to take to make sure it has—Ukraine has victory and that Russia does not prevail is continued support—what we just signed. We signed that, and a significant number of nations have signed it.
We have convinced the G-7—convinced—we've got the support of the G-7 and, quite frankly, 48 other countries. We sat with the Prime Minister of Japan, South Korea. We have—50 nations have signed up, beyond NATO and the G-7. And so we're going to stay as long as it takes.
With regard to the plan, that is a—that is a plan in process now. We're discussing with our Ukrainian friends exactly what it would be. We have a lot of movement toward that. We know the outlines of it. We have not done the detail of it all. But we know what Ukraine is capable of doing when given the material to defend themselves, and that's exactly what they're doing now.
China/Russia
Q. And my second question is to President Zelenskyy. It will be in Ukrainian.
[The reporter spoke in Ukrainian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter.]
Recently, you have made a couple of sharp statements regarding China, and there are rumors in the press regarding the possible supplies of Russia's weapons to China. Apart from that, China is actively promoting its own peace plan among certain countries. What are the motives of Beijing now? And would it be possible to change the vision of China regarding our war and which role the U.S. can play in this?
And the final question. Is China a partner of Russia in these crimes that it commits?
[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]
President Zelenskyy. [Inaudible] Too many questions. Okay. But yes, I understood that your trip was long. [Laughter]
So the—so, first of all, I had phone conversation with the leader of China by phone. He said that he will not sell any weapon to Russia. That is the first. We'll see with you. We'll see, but he said to me. If he is respectable person, he will not, because he gave me the word.
The second. Our—you know that—you know very good with details how our peace formula—it's very open for everybody, basing on charter, yes, United Nations. And you know that it's—it bases on next principles: territorial integrity, sovereignty, nuclear security, food security.
If China has alternative view on it, it can prepare alternative peace formula—if we share common views on it, like with—globally, with all the world, I think so. So, if they share the same way to peace, we will find dialogue.
President Biden. By the way, China is not supplying weapons, but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it. So it is, in fact, helping Russia.
Thank you all so very much. Appreciate it.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. This concludes our press conference. Thank you, everybody.
[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]
President Zelenskyy. Thank you so much.
[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]
Q. Mr. President, should the American hostages—[inaudible]?
Q. Mr. President, do you plan on commuting your son's sentence?
Q. President Biden——""	The President's News Conference With President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine in Savelletri di Fasano, Italy"
"Jun 14, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nation-leaders-g7-apulia-leaders-communique,Joint Statement by Group of Seven (G-7) Nation Leaders—G7 Apulia Leaders' Communiqué,"Preamble 
We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), gathered in Apulia to reaffirm our enduring unity and determination to meet global challenges at a crucial moment in history and as the international community confronts multiple interconnected crises.
We reiterate our shared belief in democratic principles and free societies, universal human rights, social progress, and respect for multilateralism and the rule of law. We commit to providing opportunities and pursuing shared prosperity. We seek to strengthen international rules and norms for the benefit of all.
Our work is grounded in our commitment to respect the UN Charter, safeguard international peace and security, and uphold the free and open rules-based international order. We will support more effective, inclusive and equitable global governance that reflects our changing world. We reaffirm our commitment to uphold human dignity and the rule of law in all parts of the world.
We are working together and with others to address the pressing challenges of our time. We are:
In taking forward all these priorities, our partnership in the G7 will continue to be guided by our joint commitment to cooperate openly and transparently in a coordinated manner.
We are grateful for the presence of His Holiness Pope Francis and for his contribution.
In a spirit of shared responsibility, we warmly welcome the participation of the Leaders of Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, India, Jordan, Kenya, Mauritania, Tunisia, Türkiye, and the United Arab Emirates.
Steadfast support to Ukraine 
We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes. Together with international partners, we are determined to continue to provide military, budget, humanitarian, and reconstruction support to Ukraine and its people. We remain strongly committed to helping Ukraine meet its urgent short-term financing needs, as well as supporting its long-term recovery and reconstruction priorities.
Russia must end its illegal war of aggression and pay for the damage it has caused to Ukraine. These damages now exceed USD 486 billion, according to the World Bank. It is not right for Russia to decide if or when it will pay for the damage it has caused in Ukraine. Russia's obligations under international law to pay for the damage it is causing are clear, and so we are continuing to consider all possible lawful avenues by which Russia is made to meet those obligations.
We remain determined to dispel any false notion that time is on Russia's side, that destroying infrastructure and livelihoods has no consequences for Russia, or that Russia can prevail by causing Ukraine to fail economically. With a view to supporting Ukraine's current and future needs in the face of a prolonged defense against Russia, the G7 will launch ""Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loans for Ukraine"", in order to make available approximately USD 50 billion in additional funding to Ukraine by the end of the year.
Therefore, without prejudice to possible other contributions and standing together, the G7 intends to provide financing that will be serviced and repaid by future flows of extraordinary revenues stemming from the immobilization of Russian Sovereign Assets held in the European Union and other relevant jurisdictions. To enable this, we will work to obtain approval in these jurisdictions to use future flows of these extraordinary revenues to service and repay the loans. We confirm that, consistent with all applicable laws and our respective legal systems, Russia's sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia ends its aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine. We will maintain solidarity in our commitment to providing this support to Ukraine.
We intend to disburse this financing through multiple channels that direct the funds to Ukraine's military, budget, and reconstruction needs - within the constraints of our respective legal systems and administrative requirements. As it relates to reconstruction, we will also strengthen the Ukraine Multi-Donor Coordination Platform to help coordinate the disbursal of funds and ensure they align with Ukraine's highest priority needs at a pace it can effectively absorb. This will play a key role in advancing Ukraine's reforms in line with its European path.
In light of the above, we task our relevant Ministers and officials to operationalize these commitments in time for ERA to begin disbursing before year-end.
As we reiterated in our Statement on Ukraine in February, Ukraine is defending its freedom, sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, against Russia's brutal and unjustifiable war of aggression. We continue to condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia's blatant breach of international law, including the UN Charter and of basic principles that underpin the international order. Any use of nuclear weapons by Russia in the context of its war of aggression against Ukraine would be inadmissible. We therefore condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia's irresponsible and threatening nuclear rhetoric as well as its posture of strategic intimidation, including its announced deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus. We remain committed to holding those responsible accountable for their atrocities against the people of Ukraine, in line with international law. We also condemn the seizures of foreign companies and call on Russia to reverse these measures and seek acceptable solutions with the companies targeted by them.
We support Ukraine's right of self-defense and reiterate our commitment to Ukraine's long-term security, including by implementing bilateral security commitments and arrangements based on the Joint Declaration endorsed in Vilnius last July. We are increasing our production and delivery capabilities to assist its self-defense. We also support efforts to assist Ukraine modernizing its armed forces and strengthening its own defense industry. We express our resolve to bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities to save lives and protect critical infrastructure.
We are committed to raising the costs of Russia's war by building on the comprehensive package of sanctions and economic measures already in place. Though our measures have had a significant impact on Russia's ability to build its war machine and to fund its invasion, its military is still posing a threat not just to Ukraine but also to international security.
We will continue taking measures against actors in China and third countries that materially support Russia's war machine, including financial institutions, consistent with our legal systems, and other entities in China that facilitate Russia's acquisition of items for its defense industrial base.
In this context, we reiterate that entities, including financial institutions, that facilitate Russia's acquisition of items or equipment for its defense industrial base are supporting actions that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine. Accordingly, we will impose restrictive measures consistent with our legal systems to prevent abuse and restrict access to our financial systems for targeted individuals and entities in third countries, including Chinese entities, that engage in this activity. We will take robust action against actors who aid Russia in circumventing our sanctions, including by imposing severe costs on all those who fail to immediately cease providing material support to Russia's aggression and by strengthening domestic enforcement and stepping up our business engagement to promote corporate responsibility. We call on financial institutions to refrain from supporting and profiting from Russia's war machine. We will take further steps to deter and disrupt this behaviour.
We will continue to apply significant pressure on Russian revenues from energy and other commodities. This will include improving the efficacy of the oil price cap policy by taking further steps to tighten compliance and enforcement, while working to maintain market stability. We will take steps, including sanctions and innovative enforcement activities leveraging respective geographies, to combat Russia's use of deceptive alternative shipping practices to circumvent our sanctions by way of its shadow fleet. We call on industry actors facilitating this activity to consider the financial liability and environmental and reputational damage risks associated with these practices. We will impose additional sanctions measures on those engaged in deceptive practices while transporting Russian oil and against the networks Russia has developed to extract additional revenue from price cap violations or from oil sales using alternative service providers. We will continue taking further steps to limit Russia's future energy revenues by impeding development of future energy projects and disrupting access to the goods and services on which those projects rely. We will continue our efforts to reduce Russia's revenues from metals.
Ukraine's reconstruction remains a key priority, including early recovery measures and addressing the current energy emergency caused by Russia's increased targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure. We re-emphasize our strong support for Ukraine's energy security, including by coordinating international assistance through the G7+ Ukraine Energy Coordination Group. We will continue to work with the Ukrainian authorities and International Financial Institutions through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform, and by mobilizing private investments and fostering participation of civil society.
We highlight the reality of 3.4 million internally displaced Ukrainians and the importance of inclusive recovery and the need to address the needs of women, children and persons with disabilities as well as other population groups who have been disproportionately affected by Russia's war of aggression. The reintegration of combatants and civilians with disabilities in society remains a priority. We call on Russia to release all persons it has unlawfully detained and to safely return all civilians it has illegally transferred or deported, starting with children.
We reiterate our support for Ukraine's agriculture sector, which is critical for global food supply, particularly for the most vulnerable nations. We therefore call for unimpeded deliveries of grain, foodstuffs, fertilizers and inputs from Ukraine across the Black Sea and recall the importance of the EU Solidarity Lanes and President Zelenskyy's Grain from Ukraine initiative.
We are also working to involve our private sectors in the sustainable economic recovery of Ukraine. We welcome and underscore the significance of Ukraine itself continuing to implement domestic reform efforts, especially in the fields of anti-corruption, justice system reform, decentralization, and promotion of the rule of law. We will continue to support efforts of the Ukrainian government and people in these endeavors. We will build on the Japan-Ukraine Conference for Promotion of Economic Growth and Reconstruction held in Tokyo on 19 February and the Ukraine Recovery Conference held on 11-12 June in Berlin and we look forward to the next Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome in 2025.
We welcome the Summit on Peace in Ukraine planned in Switzerland on 15-16 June to build a framework for peace based on international law, the UN Charter and its principles, with respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will continue to work to achieve the widest possible international support for the key principles and objectives of President Zelenskyy's Peace Formula.
Our ultimate goal remains a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in line with international law and the UN Charter and its principles and respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will continue to stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.
Conflict in Gaza 
We reiterate our strongest condemnation of the brutal terrorist attacks conducted by Hamas and other terrorist groups against Israel on 7 October 2023. We express our full solidarity and support to Israel and its people and reaffirm our unwavering commitment towards its security. In exercising its right to defend itself, Israel must fully comply with its obligations under international law in all circumstances, including international humanitarian law. We condemn Hamas for its continuing use of civilian infrastructure for its military activities and failure to separate and distinguish itself from civilians in Gaza. We deplore all losses of civilian lives equally, and note with great concern the unacceptable number of civilian casualties especially women and children. We call on all parties to take every feasible step to protect civilian lives.
We fully endorse and will stand behind the comprehensive deal outlined by President Biden that would lead to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, a significant and sustained increase in the flow of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the crisis, with Israel's security interests and safety for Palestinian civilians in Gaza assured. In this regard, we welcome UNSC Resolution S/RES/2735 (2024). We reiterate our call on Hamas to fully and unequivocally accept and implement the cease fire proposal, as outlined in Resolution 2735, and urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so. We welcome Israel's acceptance of the proposal and readiness to move forward with it.
We urge all parties to facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need, in particular women and children. Securing full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access in all its forms, consistent with international humanitarian law, and through all relevant land crossing points, including the Rafah crossing, through maritime delivery routes, including through Ashdod Port, and throughout all of Gaza remains an absolute priority. We agree it is critical that UNRWA and other UN organizations and agencies' distribution networks be fully able to deliver aid to those who need it most, fulfilling their mandate effectively.
We are deeply concerned by the consequences on the civilian population of the ongoing ground operations in Rafah, and the possibility of a full-scale military offensive that would have further dire consequences for civilians. We call on the Government of Israel to refrain from such an offensive.
We welcome the appointment of the new Palestinian Authority cabinet and remain ready to support the Palestinian Authority as it undertakes the reforms that are indispensable to enable it to discharge its responsibilities in the West Bank and, in the aftermath of the conflict, in Gaza. Actions that weaken the Palestinian Authority must stop, including the withholding of clearance revenues by the Israeli Government. Maintaining economic stability in the West Bank is critical for regional security. We call on Israel to take the necessary measures to ensure that correspondent banking services between Israeli and Palestinian banks remain in place, so that vital financial transactions and critical trade in services continue; to release withheld clearance revenues to the Palestinian authority, in view of its urgent fiscal needs; and to remove or relax other measures to avoid further exacerbating the economic situation in the West Bank.
We reiterate our unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution where two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders, consistent with international law and relevant UN resolutions, and in this regard stress the importance of unifying the Gaza strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority. We note that mutual recognition, to include the recognition of a Palestinian state, at the appropriate time, would be a crucial component of that political process.
We affirm our commitment to working together—and with other international partners—to closely coordinate and institutionalize our support for civil society peacebuilding efforts, ensuring that they are part of a larger strategy to build the foundation necessary for a negotiated and lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace.
All parties must refrain from any unilateral actions that undermine the prospect of a two-state solution, including Israeli expansion of settlements and the ""legalization"" of settlement outposts. We condemn the rise in extremist settler violence committed against Palestinians, which undermines security and stability in the West Bank, and threatens prospects for a lasting peace. We encourage support for the Palestinian Authority Security Services to make sure the West Bank remains stable and conducive to the ultimate establishment of a Palestinian state.
We are deeply engaged—along with partners in the region—in preventing the conflict from escalating further. We reiterate our firm condemnation of Iran's attack against Israel of 13-14 April, which marked an unacceptable escalation, and we reaffirm our commitment towards Israel security. We call on all parties to lower tensions and contribute in a constructive way to de-escalation.
We are particularly concerned by the situation along the Blue Line. We recognize the essential stabilizing role played by the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in mitigating that risk. We urge all involved actors to exercise restraint to avoid further escalation, consistent with UNSCR 1701.
Freedom of Navigation in the Red Sea 
We condemn the ongoing attacks perpetrated by the Houthis against international and commercial vessels transiting through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. These illegal attacks must end. We call for the immediate release by the Houthis of the Galaxy Leader and its crew. We reiterate the right of countries to defend their vessels, in line with UNSCR 2722 and in accordance with international law.
The EU maritime operation ""Aspides"" and the U.S.-led operation ""Prosperity Guardian"" play an essential role to protect crucial shipping lanes that are fundamental for global trade. Maritime security and navigational rights and freedoms are critical to ensuring free movement of essential commodities to destinations and populations all over the world. This includes delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance to more than half the population of Yemen.
The continuing Houthi attacks in the Red Sea risk destabilizing the region, stopping freedom of navigation and trade flows and endangering the UN-led roadmap towards peace in Yemen. We call on the Houthis to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and cease their attacks in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and surrounding waters. We further call on Yemeni parties to continue their positive efforts in furtherance of the understanding reached in December 2023, under UN auspices, regarding the peace process.
Iran
Iran must cease its destabilizing actions.
We reiterate our determination that it must never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon. We urge Tehran to cease and reverse nuclear escalations, and stop the continuing uranium enrichment activities that have no credible civilian justifications. Iran must engage in serious dialogue and provide convincing assurances that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful, in full cooperation and compliance with the IAEA's monitoring and verification mechanism, including the Board of Governors' resolution of 5 June. We support IAEA's monitoring and verification role regarding Iran's nuclear-related obligation and commitments and express strong concern about Iran's current lack of cooperation with the Agency.
We call on Iran to stop assisting Russia's war in Ukraine and not to transfer ballistic missiles and related technology, as this would represent a substantive material escalation and a direct threat to European security. We are prepared to respond in a swift and coordinated manner, including with new and significant measures.
We demand that Iran cease its malicious activities and destabilizing actions in the Middle East and we stand ready to adopt further sanctions or take other measures in response to further destabilizing initiatives. We continue to call for the immediate release of the MSC Aries, its remaining crew and cargo.
We reiterate our deep concern over Iran's human rights violations, especially against women, girls and minority groups. We call on Iran's leadership to end all unjust and arbitrary detentions, including of dual and foreign citizens, and condemn the unacceptable harassment of its citizens.
Fostering partnerships with African countries 
We are committed to stepping up our support to African countries in their efforts to achieve sustainable development and local value creation, strengthen democratic governance, contribute to global stability and prosperity, and protect the rule-based international order. In doing so, we remain focused on equitable partnerships rooted in shared principles, democratic values, local ownership, and concrete initiatives. We will align our efforts with the African Union Agenda 2063 and African countries' needs and priorities, including the integrated African continental plans for improved local and regional food security, infrastructure, trade and agricultural productivity. We will also support the operationalization of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA) which will be an essential parameter of African growth in the coming decade.
We will reinforce mutually beneficial and equitable cooperation with African countries and regional organizations. While assuring African countries our continued financial support, we will enhance the coordination and effectiveness of G7 cooperation resources; support better mobilization and management of local domestic resources; and promote increased private investment. We endorse African countries' call for greater voice in international bodies and welcome the AU's participation in the G20 as a permanent member, and the creation of a third Chair for sub-Saharan Africa at the IMF Executive Board in November. We reiterate our support for the G20 Compact with Africa, as a tool to increase private sector investments, promote structural reforms, and local entrepreneurship support, and enhance cooperation, including in the energy sector. The G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) including initiatives such as the EU Global Gateway offer a framework, we will use to promote our vision of sustainable, resilient, and economically viable infrastructure in Africa, underpinned by transparent project selection, procurement, and finance. In that respect, we welcome the Mattei Plan for Africa launched by Italy.
Acknowledging that sustainable development and democracy are mutually reinforcing, we reiterate our commitment to supporting African governments in advancing democratic governance and human rights, as we address conditions conducive to terrorism, violent extremism, and instability. In this respect, we are concerned about the activities of the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group's and other emerging Russia-backed forces, which are having a destabilizing impact. We call for accountability of all those responsible for human rights violations and abuses.
Countries should not be forced to choose between fighting against poverty and protecting the planet or addressing global challenges, nor between repaying creditors and making further investments in development. We are committed to evolve the international financial architecture to make it fit for the challenges of today's world. We support the ambition of partnerships such as the G20 Compact with Africa and the Paris Pact for People and Planet (4P), which work to foster collaboration between key global stakeholders to deliver additional financing for development, climate, and nature and fostering private sector investment. As outlined in the Nairobi-Washington Vision, we call on the international community to step up sustainable and transparent financing for developing countries willing to commit to ambitious reforms and investment plans, while emphasizing the importance of domestic resource mobilization. This includes working with other stakeholders to deliver coordinated international financial institution support packages, utilize tools to facilitate private finance on better terms and unlock private investments, and activate creditor coordination and private sector participation when needed so as to ensure multilateral support is being used in the best interest of developing countries. We will work with the IMF, the World Bank, and other key parties to bring this plan forward, with a view to realize it for pilot countries by the end of 2024.
Sustainable Development, Food Security and PGII 
We reaffirm our steadfast commitment towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and we will redouble our efforts to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), restated at the 2023 SDG Summit, to ensure nobody is left behind. With our partners, we will work on concrete and ambitious actions to achieve long-term sustainable development, strong, environmental social and governance standards, and shared prosperity worldwide.
Noting that we have already exceeded our joint commitment of USD 14 billion to global food security, announced in Elmau in 2022, we remain steadfast in addressing the escalating global food security and nutrition crisis, aggravated by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.
We are launching the G7 Apulia Food Systems Initiative (AFSI) to intensify our efforts to overcome structural barriers to food security and nutrition and to build resilient sustainable and productive agriculture and food systems, and to ensure that all people can progressively realize the right to adequate food. This includes enhancing sustainability and productivity of local, regional, and global supply chains and addressing discriminatory rules and norms that affect gender equality. This initiative will leverage multi-stakeholder partnerships to advance ambitious programs on the ground and harness the full potential of food systems.
Noting global food supply disruptions due to climate change and that the Paris Agreement can only be reached by transforming food systems, we will support synergetic and coherent policies and investments to address the climate-food systems nexus, particularly in low-income countries. We will contribute to these efforts globally, with a special attention to implementing and aligning with the African continental plans by supporting the following multi-stakeholder programs developed with the African Union and other global partners: i) the Technical Cooperation Collaborative to implement the ""COP28 UAE Declaration on sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems, and climate action"" and enhance access to quality technical cooperation for the integration of food systems and climate plans in low-income and climate vulnerable countries; ii) the Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils for the restoration and maintenance of healthy soils and the further development and climate resilience of traditional and indigenous crops in Africa, recalling the importance of Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit 2024; iii) a G7 private-public initiative on coffee aimed to further advance policy, sustained investments, research and innovation, partnerships, blended finance to boost the resilience, environmental sustainability, value addition and circularity of the coffee value chains worldwide and to support smallholders and family farmers in producing countries, including examining the feasibility of the establishment of a global private-public fund on coffee.
Given childhood stunting and wasting caused by malnutrition can have lifelong physical, psychological, and social effects that threaten sustainable development, we commit to support treatment and prevention to address this challenge. We will foster multi-stakeholder engagement and innovation, including with multilaterals, the private sector and philanthropies, and welcome in particular the 2025 Paris Nutrition for Growth Summit.
We will also promote innovative solutions to increase the quantity and quality of public and private funding for food security and food systems in low-income countries. We will: i) work together to improve the fiscal space for food security in line with continued efforts to improve the international financial architecture, including further analysis of the potential of debt swaps, ii) building on existing cooperation, initiate a collaborative of G7 public development banks and DFIs to enhance co-investment and risk-mitigation for sustainable agriculture and food systems transformation; iii) support the design and development of a Financing for Shock-Driven Food Crisis Facility to provide rapid-response financing in anticipation of severe food crises, also involving private capital from global insurance markets.
Accordingly, we task our Development Ministers to further articulate the AFSI commitments and actions, ahead of their Meeting in October, in synergy with Ministers of Finance, Agriculture and Environment noting in particular the Initiative on Strengthening Seed Certification Capacity in Africa and the Africampus program to bridge educational gaps for African farmers and entrepreneurs, under joint development by the Ministers of Agriculture and international partners.
We also highlight synergies between AFSI, the Global Alliance for Food Security, and the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty under development within the G20, which the ambitions of we fully support.
We also continue to support coordinated action with and among the UN Rome Based Agencies and the wider UN system, Multilateral Development Banks and other relevant organizations, including the African Union.
With a view to addressing global food insecurity and malnutrition, we also acknowledge the importance of supporting fertilizer value chains including local fertilizer production in line with WTO rules and through supporting the use of local sources of energy in consistency with a 1.5°C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement.
We reaffirm our commitment to mobilize up to USD 600 billion through the PGII by 2027 towards sustainable, inclusive, resilient, and quality infrastructure and investments with partner countries, with a particular focus on Africa and on the Indo-Pacific. We reaffirm the Carbis Bay commitment for our DFIs and multilateral partners to invest at least USD 80 billion into the private sector in Africa, and we recognize the importance of directing more investment to poorer and more fragile countries across the continent.
We will enhance this Partnership by: i) raising the profile of the PGII initiative throughout the G7 platform with the strong coordination and involvement of all its G7 tracks and establishing a secretariat for effective implementation and investment coordination with partners; ii) supporting the launch of the African Virtual Investment Platform, in collaboration with the African Union and OECD, to enhance information sharing, transparency, and public policies on investment in Africa; iii) working together with our DFIs, MDBs, and private sector to improve green investments in Africa as part of our PGII commitment. In this respect, we will progressively enhance country-based investment coordination, including through platforms such as the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa.
We commit to implement these key pillars, as we are stepping up our efforts to attract private investments at scale, improving the enabling environments, maximizing the role of MDBs and DFIs, enhancing co-financing, advancing high standards for quality infrastructure, including through certification schemes such as the Blue Dot Network and the FAST-INFRA Initiative and further developing a pipeline of bankable projects. We also call on all actors to adhere to international rules, standards, and principles, including the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investments.
We will further promote concrete G7 PGII initiatives, flagship projects, and complementary initiatives to develop transformative economic corridors for quality infrastructure and investment, such as the deepening of our coordination and financing for the Lobito Corridor, the Luzon Corridor, the Middle Corridor, and the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, also building on the EU Global Gateway, the Great Green Wall Initiative, and the Mattei Plan for Africa launched by Italy.
Indo-Pacific 
We reiterate our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, based on the rule of law, which is inclusive, prosperous, and secure, grounded on sovereignty, territorial integrity, peaceful resolution of disputes, fundamental freedoms, and human rights. Peace and stability in the region are key to promoting global prosperity, and developments there can directly affect global security. We reaffirm our unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity and our commitment to promoting cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We also affirm our intention to work to support Pacific Island Countries' priorities as articulated through the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.
We seek constructive and stable relations with China and recognize the importance of direct and candid engagement to express concerns and manage differences. We act in our national interest. Given China's role in the international community, cooperation is necessary to address global challenges, and we continue to engage in areas of common interest. We call on China to step up efforts to promote international peace and security, and to work with us to tackle the climate, biodiversity, and pollution crises, combat illicit synthetic drug trafficking, ensure global macroeconomic stability, support global health security, and address vulnerable countries' debt sustainability and financing needs.
We recognize the importance of China in global trade. We are committed to advancing free and fair trade, a level playing field, and balanced economic relations, while updating and strengthening the multilateral rule-based trading system with the WTO at its core. We are not trying to harm China or thwart its economic development, indeed a growing China that plays by international rules and norms would be of global interest. However, we express our concerns about China's persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive non-market policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity in a growing range of sectors, undermining our workers, industries, and economic resilience and security. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. We are de-risking and diversifying supply chains where necessary and appropriate, and fostering resilience to economic coercion. We further call on China to refrain from adopting export control measures, particularly on critical minerals, that could lead to significant global supply chain disruptions.
With these concerns in mind, together with partners, we will invest in building our and their respective industrial capacities, promote diversified and resilient supply chains, and reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities. We will strengthen diplomatic efforts and international cooperation, including in the WTO, to encourage fair practices and build resilience to economic coercion. We will continue to take actions, as necessary and appropriate, to protect our workers and businesses from unfair practices, to level the playing field and remedy ongoing harm.
We call on China to uphold its commitment to act responsibly in cyberspace. We will continue our efforts to disrupt and deter persistent, malicious cyber activity stemming from China, which threatens our citizens' safety and privacy, undermines innovation, and puts our critical infrastructure at risk. We recognize the necessity of protecting certain advanced technologies that can be used to threaten our national security, without unduly limiting trade and investment.
We reaffirm that maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is indispensable to international security and prosperity. We support Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations, including in the World Health Assembly and WHO technical meetings, as a member where statehood is not a prerequisite and as an observer or guest where it is. There is no change in the basic positions of the G7 members on Taiwan, including stated one China policies. We call for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.
We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and reiterate our strong opposition to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force or coercion. We continue opposing China's dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia in the South China Sea and its repeated obstruction of countries' high seas freedom of navigation. We express serious concern about the increasing use of dangerous maneuvers and water cannons against Philippine vessels. In this regard, we reaffirm that there is no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea, and we oppose China's militarization, and coercive and intimidation activities in the South China Sea. We re-emphasize the universal and unified character of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and reaffirm UNCLOS's important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the oceans and the seas. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on 12 July 2016 is a significant milestone, which is legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings, and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties.
We express our deep concern at the People's Republic of China's support to Russia. We call on China to press Russia to stop its military aggression and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine. We encourage China to support a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on territorial integrity and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, including through its direct dialogue with Ukraine. China's ongoing support for Russia's defense industrial base is enabling Russia to maintain its illegal war in Ukraine and has significant and broad-based security implications. We call on China to cease the transfer of dual-use materials, including weapons components and equipment, that are inputs for Russia's defense sector.
We remain concerned by the human rights situation in China, including in Tibet and in Xinjiang where forced labor is a major concern to us. We are also worried by China's crackdown on Hong Kong's autonomy, independent institutions, and civil society and continued erosion of rights and freedom, including through the recent enactment of legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law that has broad and vaguely defined provisions regarding ""sedition"", ""state secrets,"" and interactions with foreign entities. We express concerns about the use of such laws to silence dissent in Hong Kong and overseas, including politically motivated prosecutions. These developments will make it harder to live, work and do business in Hong Kong.
We call on China not to conduct or condone activities aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities and the integrity of our democratic institutions, and to act in strict accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.
We reiterate our call for the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of all North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. We urge all UN Member States to fully implement all relevant UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs) and reiterate our deep disappointment with Russia's veto in March on the UNSCR 1718 Committee Panel of Experts mandate renewal. We strongly condemn North Korea's continued development of its ballistic missile program in defiance of multiple UNSCRs, including through launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and space launch vehicles using ballistic missile technologies. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, including North Korea's export and Russia's procurement of North Korean ballistic missiles in direct violation of relevant UNSCRs, as well as Russia's use of these missiles against Ukraine. We are also deeply concerned about the potential for any transfer of nuclear or ballistic missiles-related technology to North Korea, in violation of the relevant UNSCRs. We urge Russia and North Korea to immediately cease all such activities and abide by relevant UNSCRs. We reiterate our commitment to counter sanctions evasion and strengthen enforcement of all North Korea related UNSCRs. We call on North Korea to accept repeated offers of dialogue, to enhance regional peace and security. We strongly condemn North Korea's choice to prioritize its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs over the welfare of the people in North Korea and we demand that it abandons these programs. We urge North Korea to respect human rights, facilitate access for international humanitarian organizations, and resolve the abductions issue immediately.
We reiterate our firm condemnation of the brutal repression of the people of Myanmar by the Myanmar military regime, and express our concern with the expanding humanitarian crisis across the country.
We deplore the implementation of the 2010 People's Military Service Law. This is causing further internal and regional displacement, risks exacerbating divides and hampering reconciliation. Accountability for serious crimes committed in the whole country remains essential. We are particularly concerned that sectarian tensions could inflame Rakhine again, hindering the creation of conditions for voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of Rohingya refugees and all displaced persons, while propelling regional instability.
We reiterate our demands for unimpeded humanitarian access to those in need, that all parties respect human rights and international humanitarian law, and for the release of those arbitrarily detained. We reaffirm that an inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders is essential to restore foundations for a durable democratic process.
We also reiterate the importance of UNSCR 2669 and continue to support the UN's further engagement in the crisis and ASEAN's efforts to achieve the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus.
We restate our appeal on all States to prevent or to halt the flow of arms and dual-use material, including jet fuel, to the Myanmar military, and to contribute to the search for a viable political solution which respects the democratic aspirations of Myanmar's people.
Regional issues 
HAITI
We commit to work together with other members of the international community for the stabilization of Haiti and to ensure robust and timely funding and other support for the Kenya-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, which needs to be deployed as soon as possible, and to support the Haitian National Police (HNP). We welcome Kenya's leadership of the MSS mission. It is imperative that violence by criminal gangs is stopped. We welcome the establishment of the Presidential Transitional Council (CPT) as well as the appointment of interim Prime Minister Garry Conille and look forward to the rapid establishment of a transitional Government as the outcome of a transparent and inclusive national process. It is necessary to address urgently the most immediate needs of the population, protect women and children, restore security and the rule of law and start shaping the institutional framework required to lead Haiti to free and democratic elections by February 2026. We will continue to follow closely developments in Haiti. To that end, we welcome the efforts of the newly established G7 Working Group on Haiti to advance the MSS mission, the country's stabilization, including through humanitarian assistance and long-term development, accountability mechanisms, and democratic governance in Haiti.
LIBYA
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Libya's stability, independence, territorial integrity and national unity, including in the face of external interference. We call on all Libyan institutional stakeholders to overcome the current political stalemate by engaging in meaningful dialogue in good faith and without preconditions. An inclusive, Libyan-led, Libyan-owned political process facilitated by the United Nations remains the only viable pathway towards free and fair national presidential and parliamentary elections. In this context, we call on the Secretary General of the United Nations to appoint a new Special Representative without delay, and affirm our full support to the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL)'s interim leadership.
SAHEL
We remain concerned for the deterioration of the security situation in the Sahel, including the spread of terrorism and violent conflict causing widespread misery and displacement of the civilian population. This is compounded by the backsliding of the principles of constitutional rule of law, democracy and good governance and regression in the regional cooperation frameworks.
The grave human rights violations committed by multiple parties, including Russian proxies and local security forces in the region are unacceptable.
The challenge of growing political tension, confrontation, and instability in the Sahel requires renewed efforts by all relevant actors and stakeholders in reconfiguring international and regional responses.
A continued support to the civilian populations in the Sahel is essential to alleviate their suffering.
We call upon the States of the Sahel to accelerate the pace of the transition for return to constitutional order, and stand ready to assist them. We look forward to enhancing cooperation with the African Union and its current Mauritanian Presidency as well as regional organizations and the UN in fostering stability, security, good governance and development in the Sahel, preventing the ""spill-over"" of insecurity towards the Gulf of Guinea and North Africa, as well as irregular migratory flows.
SUDAN
We strongly condemn the ongoing fighting in Sudan, including human rights violations and abuses as well as international humanitarian law violations since April 2023. The situation is constantly deteriorating with increased civilian casualties. We express particular concern for the risks posed to women and children by both parties to the conflict and the increase in ethnic-based violence which must cease immediately. This is further undermining the fragile humanitarian situation and creating further displacement risks.
All parties must allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief. We reiterate our call on all parties to immediately cease hostilities throughout the country, to enter into serious, direct negotiations, to agree and implement an immediate and lasting ceasefire without pre-conditions. We are deeply concerned by the current escalation in El-Fasher in North Darfur.
We urge external actors to refrain from fueling the conflict, and we encourage all Sudanese actors to engage in a national dialogue inclusive of the composite Sudanese civil society and aimed at re-establishing civilian and representative institutions to meet the democratic aspirations of the Sudanese people.
An active African and regional role, as well as the intensified and coordinated efforts of the international community, remain essential to ending violence and restoring democracy.
We welcome the outcomes of the Paris Conference for Sudan and the neighboring countries, where over EUR 2 billion have been pledged to support the civilian population in Sudan, and those who sought refuge in neighboring countries.
VENEZUELA
We are deeply concerned by the ongoing political, economic, and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and by the lack of progress on the implementation of the Barbados Agreement of October 2023, with regard to the rights of the opposition within the electoral process and the decision to withdraw the invitation for an EU election observation mission. We call on Venezuela to fully implement the Barbados Agreement and to ensure competitive and inclusive elections on 28 July, that encompass full and credible international electoral observation missions. We further demand an end to the harassment of opposition members, and for the release of all political prisoners immediately.
We are following closely developments between Venezuela and Guyana over the Essequibo region and welcome regional efforts to maintain dialogues between the parties. We demand that Venezuela refrain from further destabilizing initiatives. The matter must be resolved peacefully, in line with international law.
BELARUS
We reiterate our condemnation of the Belarusian regime's complicity in Russia's war against Ukraine. We express our continued concern over the regime's continuing repression of independent media, civil society, opposition, and citizens that peacefully express their views. We also condemn the ill treatment of political prisoners and ask for their immediate and unconditional release.
Sustainable Urban Development 
We emphasize the transformative power of cities worldwide as drivers for sustainable development. We will continue our cooperation on sustainable urban development and task our relevant Ministers to discuss concrete actions to reduce spatial inequalities, protect the environment and climate, and promote smart and innovative economies in urban areas.
Energy, Climate and Environment 
We reiterate our determination to address the triple global crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss. We remain steadfast in our commitment to the Paris Agreement and keeping a limit of 1.5°C global temperature rise within reach and note with deep concern the findings of the first Global Stocktake at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) that there is a significant gap between global current emissions trajectories and this commitment. Our goal remains unchanged, to provide a substantial contribution to efforts to reduce global GHG emissions by around 43 per cent in this critical decade and by 60 per cent by 2035, relative to the 2019 level. We underline that this is a collective effort and further actions from all countries, especially major economies, are required in order to peak global GHG by 2025 at the latest and achieve net-zero by 2050.
We commit to submitting ambitious 1.5°C aligned NDCs, which will be catalysts for investments, with economy-wide, absolute reduction targets, covering all GHGs, sectors and categories. Underlining that this is a collective effort, we call on all countries, especially G20 and other major economies, to do the same. We will advance global and regional efforts to secure affordable clean energy for all, recognizing different national pathways.
We welcome the commitments, as set forth in COP28, to triple global renewable capacity and double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Energy efficiency is the first fuel and an essential element of clean energy transition. We also commit to meet the global goal of deploying 1500 GW of energy storage in the power sector by 2030, including through existing targets and policies. We will transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems in a just, orderly, and equitable manner, accelerating actions in this critical decade, to achieve net-zero by 2050 in keeping with the best available science. We will operationalize these commitments through the development and implementation of domestic plans, policies and actions, including to inform and be reflected in our NDCs and LTSs, and through intensive efforts to reduce demand for and use of fossil fuels. We reaffirm our commitment to eliminate inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 or sooner and will report in 2025 on progress made. We call on others to do the same.
We reaffirm the important role of high integrity carbon markets and carbon pricing, to foster cost-efficient reductions in emission levels, drive innovation and enable a transformation to net-zero and will work together and with others to accelerate their ambitious use.
To achieve our climate goals and help all countries reap the benefits of the clean energy transition, we will work with partners to end support for new unabated coal power, accelerate investments in renewable and clean energy sources, and establish secure, diverse, responsible clean energy supply chains. We reaffirm our commitment to achieve a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035 and to phase out existing unabated coal power generation in our energy systems during the first half of 2030s, or in a timeline consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5°C temperature rise within reach, in line with countries' net-zero pathways. We reiterate our call for other countries and partners to join us in ending permitting and construction of new unabated coal-fired powerplants as soon as possible, and will promote cooperation with countries, international partners, and relevant organizations, including the financial sector, to this end, noting the work of those joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance and the Coal Transition Accelerator, to facilitate these goals.
We commit to accelerating the transition toward decarbonization in the industrial sectors and particularly in the hard-to-abate sectors. We will promote and facilitate the scale-up of investments in the industrial sector for innovative technologies, smart clean electrification, improved energy efficiency, direct use of renewable heat, sustainable bio energies, sustainable production of energy from waste, sustainable biogases and biofuels, renewable, clean/zero-emission and low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives such as ammonia and direct use of renewable energy close to demand centers, the use of carbon management technologies. We also commit to accelerate the reduction of emissions from transport. We will continue working on this, including through the G7 Industrial Decarbonization Agenda as well as the Climate Club and its ambitious work program.
We reaffirm that the transition to a net-zero economy by 2050 at the latest should be inclusive and leave no one behind, and should be an opportunity for enhancing social development and economic growth, maximizing positive benefits for local economies while addressing negative social or economic impacts that may arise from climate action. Recognizing that cutting methane emissions from fossil fuel operations by means of already existing technologies is largely feasible and cost-effective for oil and gas operations, we will intensify efforts to tackle methane emissions in line with the global reduction level of at least 35 percent in methane emissions by 2035. We commit to pursue a collective effort towards a 75 per cent reduction in global methane emissions from fossil fuels, including by reducing the methane emissions intensity of oil and gas operations by 2030, through developing a robust methodology and use of measure data, and work with non-G7 oil and gas producing countries particularly in Africa, to deliver deep cuts to methane emissions.
Reaffirming our commitments in the 2023 Hiroshima Leaders' Statement, we note that G7 countries have made significant progress in reducing dependency on Russian fossil fuels, including through energy savings and gas demand reduction in a manner consistent with our Paris Commitments and address the global impact of Russia's war on energy supplies, gas prices and inflation, and people's lives, recognizing the primary need to accelerate the clean energy transition. We recognize that restricting Russian energy revenues is an essential part of our support to Ukraine and are pursuing to end significant dependency on, and to work on transitioning away from imports of Russian gas as soon as possible. In this context, we stress the important role that increased deliveries of LNG can play and acknowledge that investment in the sector can be appropriate in response to the current crisis and to address potential gas market shortfalls provoked by the crisis. In the exceptional circumstance of accelerating the phase-out of our dependency on Russian energy, publicly supported investments in the gas sector can be appropriate as a temporary response, subject to clearly defined national circumstances, if implemented in a manner consistent with our climate objectives without creating lock-in effects, for example by ensuring that projects are integrated into national strategies for the development of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen.
Those G7 countries that opt to use nuclear energy or support its use recognize its potential as a clean/zero-emissions energy source and reiterate its potential in accelerating the transition to net-zero and improving global energy security. They will continue supporting cooperative efforts to responsibly strengthen nuclear supply chains' safety, reliability and resilience while also promoting responsible waste management. We support Japan's safe, transparent, and science-based process to responsibly manage the discharge of Advanced Liquid Processing System treated water and in proactively coordinating with scientists and partners as well as the IAEA. They will also promote research and development in innovative technologies for advanced and small modular reactors, including microreactors, work collectively to enable greater access to project financing tools, and support sectorial collaboration. They note the global Declaration to Triple Global Nuclear Energy Capacity by 2050, launched during COP28. We will further reduce reliance on civil nuclear and related goods from Russia, including working to assist countries seeking to diversify their supplies. We underline that the highest standards of nuclear safety and security are important to all countries and their respective publics.
Fusion energy technology has the potential to provide a lasting solution to the global challenges of climate change and energy security. We will promote international collaborations to accelerate the development and demonstration of fusion plants to foster private investments and public engagement. With this aim, we commit to establishing a G7 Working Group on Fusion Energy. We will also work towards consistent approaches to fusion regulations. To enhance cooperation in this field, we welcome Italy and the International Atomic Energy Agency's decision to host in Rome the inaugural ministerial meeting of the World Fusion Energy Group.
We recall our commitment to holistically addressing energy security, climate crisis and geopolitical risk. In this context, we strongly encourage international partnerships to make critical minerals and critical raw materials supply chains more diversified, transparent, resilient, responsible, circular, resource efficient, and sustainable. We will support local value creation in critical minerals supply chains in line with WTO rules. We are working to advance strong international environmental, social, and governance standards for critical minerals extraction, processing, and recycling while leveraging their economic and development opportunities, particularly in low-income countries, including through implementation of the Five-Point Plan for Critical Mineral Security, as well as driving work through the International Energy Agency, the Mineral Security Partnership, and the RISE Partnership and the Sustainable Critical Mineral Alliance.
We will work to accelerate investment in clean energy and build out the secure, responsible, and diverse supply chains necessary to achieve these goals, together with partners around the world.
We are determined to ensure affordable, reliable, sustainable, clean, and modern energy in developing countries, particularly in Africa, recognizing the opportunity that the clean energy transition presents to spur a new era of productivity, industrial growth, and economic development, and to advance the priority of clean cooking in the continent. We stand ready to play a pivotal role in supporting Africa's ambitions and efforts to develop adequate clean energy infrastructure and supply chains. For this reason, we are launching the Energy for Growth in Africa initiative, alongside Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, and South Africa, and we look forward to others joining. This initiative will drive clean energy investments across the continent with strong African countries' ownership, contributing to addressing persistent barriers and gaps, and advancing sustainable, resilient and inclusive growth and industrial development. Our efforts will be geared towards ensuring Africa can fulfil its potential to become a global sustainable energy hub using relevant platforms, such as the UNDP Center for Climate, Energy and Environment established by the Italian Presidency.
Furthermore, we strongly support the creation of new sustainable energy generation capacity in Africa and the Mediterranean to contribute to global decarbonization goals, in our common fight against climate change, as well as the development of greater interconnectivity to help reduce the cost of the energy transition. We encourage and actively support the acceleration of private investment, including through public-private partnerships, increasing Africa's integration with the global energy market, in particular through the Mediterranean region.
We continue exploring innovative financing sources for climate and biodiversity action and clean energy, innovative schemes such as payment for ecosystem services, green bonds and high-integrity biodiversity credits with environmental and social safeguards. In particular, we support the issuance of green bonds in low- and middle-income countries, particularly on the African continent, to encourage private financial flows for sustainable investments and the growth of capital markets, in line with existing initiatives such as the Global Green Bonds Initiative.
We acknowledge the importance of fiscal space and mobilizing resources from all sources for increased climate and development action particularly for low-income and vulnerable countries, and that the fights against climate change and poverty go hand in hand. We will implement effective policy frameworks to drive the necessary public and private investments. In this context, we welcome the Menu of Policy Options for a Just Transition towards Net Zero and the High-Level Framework for Public-Private Insurance Programs against Natural Hazards as a viable measure.
We will work with the MDBs, IFIs and other climate finance providers to take a coordinated approach to financing climate action, nature-based solutions, and sustainable energy projects in developing countries, including by supporting private finance and domestic resource mobilization. We will effectively prioritize our international support in the energy sector towards accelerating the clean energy transition. We call on other major economies and all the relevant entities to do the same.
We look forward to setting a new collective quantified goal on climate finance at COP29, and recognize that a new goal is a unique opportunity to strengthen the international climate finance landscape in this critical decade to keep 1.5°C within reach. We emphasize that G7 countries intend to be leading contributors to a fit-for-purpose goal, underlining the importance of including those countries that are capable of contributing to any international public finance mobilization. As assessed by the OECD, developed countries exceeded the annual goal of providing and mobilizing USD 100 billion in climate finance for developing countries in 2022, an achievement that we warmly welcome.
We note that, despite progress, there is a need to continue to scale up action and support, including finance for climate adaptation as called for in the Glasgow Climate Pact. We will continue supporting the most vulnerable developing countries in translating national adaptation plans and other national adaptation instruments into investment plans aligned with their needs and priorities, including through the G7 Adaption Accelerator Hub.
We emphasize the importance of whole-of-society approaches, with the meaningful participation of the people and communities on the frontlines of the triple crisis, including women, youth, and Indigenous Peoples. We recognize that they are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change and recognize their critical role as leaders and agents of change.
Recognizing the role of younger generations to promote climate action and drive a more sustainable future, we need to empower their voices and their participation. Building on successful initiatives, such as the Youth4Climate program, we commit to amplifying youth-led initiatives, enhancing educational opportunities, and bolstering advocacy efforts.
We are committed to halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030 and to the swift and full implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) and achieving each of its goals and targets, including the 30 by 30 targets. For those G7 members that are parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), we will revise and submit updated National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans in alignment with the KMGBF or communicate national targets reflecting the KMGBF ahead of the 16th UN Biodiversity Conference. We recall our previous commitment to increase our national and international funding for nature by 2025, and to substantially and progressively increase the level of financial resources from all sources including by providing support to the Global Environment Facility. We commit to align all relevant financial and fiscal flows with the KMGBF. We note that Target 19 aims at mobilizing at least USD 200 billion per year by 2030 for biodiversity from all sources, including USD 20 billion per year by 2025 and USD 30 billion per year by 2030, through international financial resources. We are all still concerned about incentives, including subsidies, harmful to biodiversity, and call upon all relevant organizations to continue collaborating with us, including by assisting in identifying such incentives, and we are all working to fulfil our respective applicable commitments, including, inter alia, to identify these incentives by 2025, and redirect or eliminate them, while scaling-up positive incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity by 2030 at the latest, taking initial steps without delay.
In this context we are committed to halt and reverse deforestation and forest and land degradation by 2030 globally. We are committed to promoting sustainable forest management and sustainable use of woods and advancing sustainable supply chains that decouple agricultural production from deforestation and forest and land degradation, recognizing the importance of demand and supply-side measures. We are committed to developing innovative financial solutions for conserving, protecting, and restoring forests, and in that context welcome the launch of country packages for forests, nature, and climate at COP28. We will also take steps to prevent, manage, and address the negative impacts of extreme wildfires.
We reiterate our deep concern about the health of the ocean and seas, and we are united in the call for transformative action on ocean governance to tackle the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. We will work towards a successful UNOC3 in 2025 in this regard. We commit to pursue the swift ratification, approval, acceptance, and accession of the agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction and to contribute to a rapid entry into force and implementation.
We will accelerate efforts to decouple economic growth from negative environmental impacts and primary resource use by expanding the transformation of our economies to be net-zero, circular, climate-resilient, pollution-free and nature-positive. We are committed to end plastic pollution with the ambition to reduce additional plastic pollution to zero by 2040 and, as appropriate, reduce the global production and consumption of primary plastic polymers in the context of our actions throughout the full life cycle of plastic. We support efforts to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution of the highest ambition possible by the end of 2024, based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic. We also continue our work to reduce air pollution. We call on the global community to do the same. We will step up our efforts to increase resource efficiency and circular economy. They can reduce pressure on primary resources and play a key role in mitigating the adverse impacts of resource extraction and processing, while, at the same time, increasing the resilience of our economies to potential future shocks and fostering innovation and sustainability.
Safe water and healthy soils and ecosystems, including marine and coastal ecosystems, are vital for preserving life and livelihoods, and mitigating climate change and environmental degradation's impact, including climate-induced displacement, particularly in Africa. We express concern about Russia's environmentally unsustainable and unfair trading practices regarding fish and seafood products. We look forward to successful outcomes at the upcoming Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP16) in Colombia and the UN Conference to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP16) in Saudi Arabia. With this aim, the Italian G7 Presidency is setting up a Hub on Sustainable Use of Land, dedicated to promoting a collaborative and common approach to sustainable land use initiatives in Africa and the Mediterranean Basin. Recognizing the importance of water and sanitation for sustainable development, prosperity and peace, we endorse the establishment of a G7 Water Coalition to coordinate our action and strengthen our cooperation on water-related issues, and we welcome the organization of the One Water Summit in Riyadh at the margins of UNCCD COP16.
We reaffirm the critical role our DFIs can play in contributing to the mobilization of finance from all sources for advancing G7 energy, climate and environment commitments.
Artificial Intelligence, Science, Technology, and Innovation 
Artificial Intelligence can play a crucial role in promoting progress and development in our societies. We will promote safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. We will pursue an inclusive, human-centered, digital transformation that underpins economic growth and sustainable development, maximizes benefits, and manages risks, in line with our shared democratic values and respect for human rights.
In this regard, we recognize the need for approaches to AI governance that foster inclusion, to help us harness the potential of AI in a way that reflects these values and promotes its development while mitigating risks, including with respect to human rights and avoiding governance fragmentation. We will work toward these objectives by actively cooperating with other stakeholders, organizations and initiatives as relevant, such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) and the OECD. We will build on the outcomes of the AI Seoul Summit and upcoming milestones, including this year's UN Summit of the Future and the AI Action Summit in 2025.
Recognizing the importance of advancing the Hiroshima AI Process outcomes, we welcome support from the countries and organizations beyond the G7, as demonstrated by its Friends Group.
We will step up our efforts to enhance interoperability amongst our AI governance approaches to promote greater certainty, transparency and accountability while recognizing that approaches and policy instruments may vary across G7 members. We will take a risk-based approach in these efforts as we seek to foster innovation and strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth. To achieve this goal, we will step up our coordination around the evolution of our governance and regulatory frameworks, including by sharing best practices. We will enhance our regular consultations. We are also committed to deepening coordination between our respective institutes and offices focused on AI, to work towards shared understanding of risk management and advance international standards for AI development and deployment. We welcome our Industry, Tech, and Digital Ministers' efforts to advance the Hiroshima AI Process' outcomes released last year, including the development of a reporting framework for monitoring the International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems. We look forward to the pilot of the reporting framework, developed in cooperation with the OECD, in view of the Industry, Tech, and Digital Ministers' Meeting in October. We will work towards developing a brand that can be used to identify organizations that are voluntarily participating in and implementing the Code's forthcoming reporting framework.
We welcome the G7 Toolkit for Artificial Intelligence in the Public Sector, that can help governments to deliver better services to our economies and societies, while protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms.
We will work to ensure that AI enables increased productivity, quality jobs, and decent work; empowers workers; fosters inclusiveness and equal opportunities in the world of work; and enhances active labor market policies, including by fostering dialogue and transparency with workers organizations. To achieve these goals, we will launch an action plan on the use of AI in the world of work. We ask our Labor Ministers to develop the action plan, envisaging concrete actions to fully leverage the potential of AI to enable decent work and workers' rights and full access to adequate reskilling and upskilling, while addressing potential challenges and risks to our labor markets. We emphasize the need to anticipate future skills needs, provide higher education opportunities and equip workers and employers with the skills and competencies needed to design, adopt, and work with a human-centric, safe, secure and trustworthy AI. Against this background, we also emphasize the importance of innovative education, international talent mobility, digital competencies, and personalized lifelong learning to meet the demand for a qualified workforce. We recognize and encourage the work of the private sector to address skills gaps, including through the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence's Working Group on the Future of Work.
Acknowledging the key role that emerging technologies can play in economic growth, we commit to enhancing cooperation to bolster the adoption and development of new technologies, including AI, among micro, small, and medium enterprises, thereby fostering inclusive economic growth.
As we look to the future of emerging technologies, we encourage transparency and adherence to international workers' rights and labor standards at each stage of the AI supply chain. We also encourage our competition authorities to monitor the development of the AI industry, with a view to addressing potential competition issues, and prevent adverse effects at an early stage.
We will also work, including with developing countries and emerging economies, towards closing digital divides, including the gender digital divide, and achieving digital inclusion. We welcome the UN General Assembly Resolution on Seizing the Opportunities of Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI Systems for Sustainable Development, which advances international conversations on AI, including to promote equitable access to the benefits of AI for all. We will leverage the benefits of AI for SDGs by closing gaps in technologies for development, and by strengthening research and development ecosystems. To this end, G7 countries seek to promote safe, secure and inclusive practices, tools and solutions to make the benefits of AI and advanced computing available to partners to advance their development. In this regard, we welcome the Italian Presidency's decision to establish the AI Hub for Sustainable Development, in collaboration with UNDP. The Hub aims to enable multistakeholder partnerships to support local AI digital ecosystems, strengthen capacities to advance AI for sustainable development, and complement existing initiatives including the AI for Development Donors Partnership.
We reiterate the importance of operationalizing Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) to enable trustworthy cross-border data flows, and invigorate the digital economy as a whole, while preserving governments' ability to address legitimate public interest. We value OECD's leading role in advancing DFFT and we welcome its expert community.
Acknowledging the crucial role of resilient and reliable global semiconductor supply chains, we welcome the establishment of a Semiconductors G7 Point of Contact Group. This Group will bolster our coordination in addressing issues impacting the semiconductor industry. We will also advance our cooperation on secure and resilient undersea cable connectivity, in particular for strategic routes such as the Arctic and the Pacific. Our efforts will include better coordination on technical security requirements and advancing research on the economic and environmental sustainability of cable connectivity.
Given the potential of quantum technology developments, we will adopt or implement our respective quantum strategies. We also affirm our commitment to promoting responsible innovation of biotechnology, including its convergence with AI.
We support the development of frontier science, emerging technologies and research infrastructures to solve global challenges, including a better understanding of the ocean-climate-biodiversity nexus. We also emphasize the importance of promoting international talent mobility and circulation in emerging technologies among the G7 and partners, as well as cooperation with low and middle-income countries. In this regard, we reiterate our commitment to open science and research security and integrity.
We support further efforts to promote and reinforce research security and integrity, together with like-minded partners. We welcome the Extension of the G7 Virtual Academy to non-G7 like-minded partners to share best practices and policies on research security and integrity, and we welcome that Italy will host a G7 conference on these topics this year.
We recognize the impact of AI on the military domain and the need for a framework for responsible development and use. We welcome those who have endorsed the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of AI and Autonomy (REAIM) and the REAIM Call to Action, and we encourage more states to do so to ensure that military use of AI is responsible, complies with applicable international law, particularly international humanitarian law, and enhances international security.
We strongly support the implementation of the International Guidelines adopted at the UN Committee on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space as urgent and necessary. We welcome national efforts to develop further solutions for space debris mitigation and remediation, including further research and development of orbital debris mitigation and remediation technologies, and the development of space sustainability standards and regulations.
We welcome the establishment of the G7 Venice Justice Group, which will serve as a coordinative function to address global challenges, including AI, using our judicial and enforcement expertise. Against this background, we recognize the impacts of deploying AI within the justice sector and that the use of AI systems must not interfere with the decision-making power of judges nor judicial independence.
Labor and Employment 
We will continue promoting job quality and decent work as well as the fundamental principles and rights at work, including the right to safe and healthy working environments, underlining the important role of social dialogue and collective bargaining in this regard. We commit to ensure full respect of international labor standards and human rights to promote fair and non-exploitative working conditions, including in global value chains, in particular the fundamental conventions adopted by the ILO. We will promote technical cooperation on these issues and will intensify our efforts to abolish all forms of forced and compulsory labor and child labor. We will continue advancing the inclusion of persons with disabilities and accelerating gender and other forms of equality in the world of work. We underscore the importance of continuing investing in human capital and lifelong learning systems that provide high-quality job opportunities for all, including those in the green and digital economy. To address the challenges of ageing societies, we will continue to work for resilient labor markets and to promote active and healthy ageing, addressing obstacles to labor market participation, especially of the underrepresented groups, and will promote solutions to improve working conditions in the care sector to make it more attractive for job seekers and qualified workers and to better support our citizens over their life-course.
Cybersecurity 
The security of our societies increasingly depends on an open, interoperable, safe, secure, resilient, human rights respecting use of cyberspace. We rely on the continuing work of the Ise-Shima Cyber Group in advancing responsible state behavior in cyberspace, through the application of international law, including IHL, effective confidence-building measures, targeted capacity-building initiatives, based on a multistakeholder approach, and integrating cybersecurity into the development agenda. We reaffirm our support for the Program of Action to Advance Responsible State' Behaviour in the Use of ICTs in the context of international security, as the permanent and action-oriented mechanism to hold discussions on cybersecurity at the UN from 2025 onwards.
We are resolute in countering strategic threats and in holding malicious cyber actors to account. Our relevant institutions will intensify their work on enhancing information exchange and coordination. We are committed to taking concrete steps to improve our collective resilience through the newly established G7 Cybersecurity Working Group leveraging synergies with the Ise-Shima Cyber Group.
We are pursuing a four-fold approach to counter malicious cyber activities: i) promoting responsible state behavior in cyber space, ii) improving cybersecurity, including in the private sector; iii) developing and using tools to deter and respond to malicious (state) behavior and to cyber criminals, and disrupt the infrastructure they use, including by enhancing coordination on attribution processes; and iv) strengthening our partners' cyber security capacity.
To counter the rise in ransomware attacks by cybercriminals, we continue to make best use of the International Counter Ransomware Initiative and will coordinate our efforts to avoid ransom payments. We will also consider actions to impose costs on malicious actors.
We recognize rising cyber threats to critical infrastructure, in particular in the energy sector, which is heavily targeted by adversarial countries and criminals. We will continue discussions on good cybersecurity practices in these sectors, including ways to increase supply chains resilience and security, whilst acknowledging existing regulatory frameworks. To incentivize tech companies to build more secure Internet of Things products we will promptly explore avenues towards establishing mutual recognition of schemes for reliable cyber-safe products. We strongly encourage manufacturers to improve the security of products throughout their life cycle and make them secure-by-design and secure-by-default.
We are willing to work with all those who share our common objective to ensure a cyberspace that supports inclusive and democratic societies, narrows the gender gap in this field, and promotes multistakeholder partnerships, including with the private sector.
Migration 
We affirm our collective commitment to addressing migration as a global phenomenon, tackling the challenges it presents and seizing the opportunities it brings globally, through an integrated, comprehensive, balanced approach, in line with international law. We recognize that developing sustainable, inclusive solutions to effectively manage migration to the benefit of all, including low- and middle-income countries facing significant migratory pressures, demands collective actions carried out in a spirit of commitment and joint responsibility. We will work to ensure a governance of migration that is increasingly effective and sustainable within the framework of our international obligations, relevant treaties and conventions. While doing so, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, regardless of their migratory status, and, in this regard, we also recall the right of everyone to seek asylum from persecution as per the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to seek international protection as safeguarded by the Geneva Convention on Refugees.
Against this background, we will enhance cooperation by promoting a three-pronged approach, in partnership with countries of origin and transit, focusing on: (i) the root causes of irregular migration, through sustainable development initiatives, economic investment, and stabilization efforts, in partnership with countries of origin and transit; (ii) efforts to enhance border management and enforcement and curb transnational organized crime involved in migrant smuggling and trafficking in persons; (iii) safe and regular pathways for migration. Our vision draws also on the principles of the Rome Process, the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, as well as the Global Forum on Migration and Development.
Under the first pillar, we will enhance efforts to address the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement—such as conflict, political instability, poverty, crime, corruption, and human rights abuses. We also acknowledge that climate change is a risk multiplier, intersecting with and exacerbating other drivers of mobility. We aim to foster comprehensive and equitable partnerships between countries of origin, transit, and destination to pave the way for long-term structural solutions that contribute to sustainable development, resilience, and stability. We will strengthen collaboration and regional efforts to support economic, governance, social, and environmental conditions, enabling all individuals to live and thrive in their own countries, safeguarding their safety, rights, and dignity. In this regard, we acknowledge that countries of origin and countries and communities hosting large numbers of migrants and refugees may need international financial assistance to support development, as well as humanitarian assistance, security, public health, education and employment. To do so, we will leverage our policies and actions, to ensure that we address the root causes of irregular migration.
For the second pillar, we will step up our efforts to prevent and address irregular migration, counter the illegal activities that facilitate it, and tackle the challenges it poses to individuals and societies. We affirm the sovereign right of states to control their borders, as well as their prerogative to govern migration within their jurisdiction, in conformity with international law. We promote actions that are in line with international law, including international human rights law, and the principle of non-refoulement. We will employ a whole-of-route approach, and work towards strategies aimed at deterring individuals from embarking on irregular and perilous migration journeys.
In particular, we will work to strengthen border management and visa policies and processes, also with a view to limit the activities of migrant smuggling and trafficking networks. We will also work collectively to support the safe and dignified return of persons not eligible to remain, as well as to support sustainable reintegration efforts in countries of origin. We will leverage our collective diplomatic efforts in encouraging countries to readmit their nationals, in line with their international commitments and through due processes.
In line with the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) and its Protocols, we will also strengthen our actions to prevent, counter, and dismantle organized criminal networks that profit from the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons and disrupt their business models. To this end, we are launching a G7 Coalition to Prevent and Counter the Smuggling of Migrants. Through this initiative, we will promote enhanced cooperation on investigative capacities, engaging relevant authorities in countries of origin, transit, and destination. We will encourage advancements toward improved and reliable data exchanges, crucial for evidence-based joint enforcement actions against smuggling and trafficking networks. We will utilize a ""follow the money"" approach to effectively identify, investigate, and disrupt organized crime, tackling financial aspects, including enhanced cooperation on asset confiscation. We also recognize the importance of raising awareness and informing potential migrants on the risks associated with migrant smuggling and trafficking in persons, to deter them from embarking on perilous routes. We task our G7 Interior and Security Ministers, in coordination with other relevant Ministers, to create a dedicated Action Plan to advance the G7 Coalition, to be adopted at the upcoming Interior and Security Ministers meeting. In implementing this Action Plan, we will ensure the Coalition works through ongoing partnerships and mechanisms, including with UNODC and other relevant United Nations bodies, the Financial Action Task Force, INTERPOL, EUROPOL, the EU's Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling, and through G7 frameworks such as the Roma-Lyon Group and the Venice Justice Group.
For the third pillar, we acknowledge the importance of safe and regular pathways for migrants and refugees as part of comprehensive, whole-of-route migration management strategies. Regular pathways can represent realistic alternatives and have the potential to reduce irregular migration and the use of smuggling and trafficking networks, and contribute to preventing the adverse humanitarian consequences of embarking on perilous routes. In this regard, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring safe, orderly, and regular migration, and recognize the important economic and social benefits that migrants can bring to our countries as well as to low- and middle-income countries, including through remittances.
Regular pathways need to respond to national requirements, adhere to our legislations, sovereign decisions, and to the principles of fair recruitment. Driven by a spirit of joint responsibility, we will advance cooperation on regular pathways, including by supporting partner countries in improving migration governance while addressing the challenges and risks associated with irregular migration. In this context, we acknowledge ongoing regional efforts aimed at securing talents and professional mobility, as well as programs aimed at establishing and sustaining effective avenues for resettlement. These initiatives can provide safe and legal pathways for migrants while also addressing labor gaps in countries of destination. They should be designed in consideration of the needs of vulnerable populations and employ gender- and age-sensitive approaches, to prevent abuses and exploitation, protect human rights and dignity, and enhance safety and security worldwide. As such, we will continue to include regular pathways as part of our comprehensive policy frameworks, including labor pathways implemented in partnership with developing countries, as appropriate. We will promote their effective and lawful utilization, while sustaining and encouraging discussions on these matters in relevant international and regional fora, towards increasingly shared and collaborative approaches.
Global Economy and Finance 
We acknowledge that the global economy has shown greater resilience than expected, but it remains exposed to risks arising from geopolitical tensions, renewed volatility in energy prices, and further disruptions to the smooth functioning of supply chains. Our policy efforts will continue to focus on promoting innovation, the just green and digital transitions, and productivity growth, while gradually rebuilding fiscal buffers, and ensuring price and financial stability. We also reaffirm our existing G7 exchange rate commitments. We express concerns about the comprehensive use of non- market policies and practices that create global spillovers. We encourage work, among all relevant tracks, to assess the macroeconomic impact of subsidies, and other industrial and trade policy measures globally, based on comparable information; and to foster a dialogue with non-G7 countries on issues related to industrial policies, economic fragmentation, market concentration risks and overcapacity. To achieve these goals, we will enhance cooperation to advance a G7 dialogue between relevant ministries, and, as appropriate, also engage partners beyond the G7, in addition to the IMF, WBG, WTO, and OECD.
We underline the importance of the work carried out by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Standard-setting Bodies to identify, monitor and address vulnerabilities in the financial system. We strongly support ongoing work to enhance the resilience of the nonbank financial intermediation sector. We also reaffirm our commitment to implement effective regulatory and supervisory frameworks for crypto assets, and welcome initiatives to take forward the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments. We reiterate the importance of stepping up global efforts to combat money-laundering, terrorist, and proliferation financing, and support the relevant Financial Action Task Force (FATF)'s initiatives.
We reiterate our strong political commitment to a more stable and fairer international tax system, fit for the 21st century. We are committed to finalizing the work within the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework, with a view to open for signature the Multilateral Convention on Pillar One by the end of June 2024, and we call for further progress on the implementation of Pillar Two. We welcome progress made on tax transparency and support the effective implementation of the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework by the relevant jurisdictions. We remain committed to fostering international cooperation on tax issues, building on existing achievements, with the broad participation of developing and developed countries. We will continue to work constructively with the Brazilian G20 Presidency to advance international cooperation. We will work to increase our efforts aimed at progressive and fair taxation of individuals. We acknowledge the discussions at the UN Ad Hoc Committee for a Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, emphasizing the importance of consensus-based decisions to support a stable and predictable international tax system, promote inclusive and effective international tax cooperation, prioritizing issues such as enhancing domestic resource mobilization and tax capacity building for developing countries and emerging markets.
Mounting debt burdens are constraining the ability of low- and middle-income countries to invest in their futures and achieve the SDGs. We call on all stakeholders to redouble efforts and improve the ability to help low- and middle-income countries that fall into debt distress. This includes finalizing outstanding country cases, making future debt treatment more transparent and timelier, and improving our toolkits to put countries tackling reforms on a more sustainable footing before they fall into crisis. We look forward to the G20 improving the implementation of the Common Framework for debt treatment beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in a predictable, timely, orderly, and coordinated manner, providing more clarity to debtors and creditors and building on lessons learned. Beyond the Common Framework, debt vulnerabilities in middle-income countries should be addressed by enhancing multilateral coordination. We underline the importance of debt transparency and information sharing in debt restructurings and call on all creditors' participation in data-sharing exercises. We encourage the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR) to continue its work, fostering a constructive and inclusive dialogue among all parties. We welcome the development of Climate Resilient Debt Clauses (CRDCs) and encourage more creditors to offer CRDCs.
We reiterate our firm commitment to evolve and strengthen MDBs to address the most pressing development and global challenges, and welcome further discussions in line with our G20 commitment to achieve better, bigger, and more effective MDBs. We welcome the considerable progress that MDBs have already achieved and will continue to support them. We also welcome that the implementation of the G20 MDBs Capital Adequacy Framework (CAF) Review has already secured over USD 200 billion of additional financing for the next ten years and call for further CAF implementation to unlock additional significant financing while safeguarding MDBs excellent credit ratings and preferred creditor status.
We are committed to delivering innovative instruments at the MDBs such as hybrid capital and portfolio guarantees, for which the G7 and other donors have already demonstrated their support. Once approved domestically, current G7 commitments to these instruments will make it possible to further boost World Bank lending by around USD 70 billion over the next ten years. We also commend the AfDB for its successful first issuance of hybrid capital to market investors. We call on the MDBs to jointly explore ways to better reflect the value of callable capital in their capital adequacy methodologies, including through further discussions with credit rating agencies.
We reaffirm the importance of continuing to provide significant concessional support to low-income countries. In this regard, we welcome the successful replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (AsDF14) support a successful International Development Association (IDA21) replenishment and commit to work toward a successful replenishment of the African Development Fund next year (AfDF17). We recognize that contributions from all stakeholders are needed, and we support efforts to broaden the donor base.
We strongly support the IMF's commitment towards the most vulnerable, including through our contributions to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). We reiterate the call on all IMF members who are able to contribute, especially those that have not yet done so, to consider providing financial support. We look forward to a comprehensive and timely review of the PRGT, and we are open to discuss all viable options, including the use of internal resources, to ensure the long term financial self-sustainability of the PRGT and to help meet the growing needs of low-income countries. We welcome the interim review of the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) and its focus on resilience to climate change and pandemics.
We support the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa (AGIA), as an innovative financial mechanism of the African Development Bank in partnership with the African Union, Africa50 and other development partners, aimed at mobilizing blended capital to design and develop a USD 10 billion bankable portfolio of transformative green infrastructure projects in Africa to accelerate the energy transition, bridge the long-standing infrastructure gap and promote climate resilience. As G7, we will collectively contribute up to USD 150 million in grants, concessional and commercial capital to AGIA and we expect to help leverage around up to USD 3 billion of private sector investment in green infrastructure in Africa.
We look forward to the seventh edition of the OECD World Forum on Wellbeing to be hosted by Italy in Rome on 4-6 November 2024, focusing, inter alia, on policy issues, such as climate change and AI, from a well-being perspective.
Trade 
Global threats, particularly Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, including its continuous attempts to disrupt maritime trade in the Black Sea and the persistent Houthi attacks on commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, have highlighted the critical need to address vulnerabilities in global supply chains, ports, and trade flows.
To meet these challenges, we launched the G7 Working Group on Transport Supply Chains, which will enhance the G7's ability to strengthen the resilience of transport flows and networks.
We remain united in our commitment to the rules-based, free and fair, equitable, and transparent multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core. Despite the lack of more ambitious outcomes, we recognize the results of the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC13). We welcome the decision to maintain the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions until MC14 and we reiterate our support for a permanent prohibition. We are committed to working towards a prompt conclusion of negotiations of the Joint Statement Initiative on E-Commerce.
We underscore the need to reform the WTO's monitoring, deliberative, and negotiating functions and remain committed to conducting discussions with a view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all Members by the end of 2024. We call on relevant countries to refrain from claiming special and differential treatment in the WTO, commensurate with their economic weight and role in the global trading system. We also call for an ambitious and comprehensive agreement on global fisheries subsidies.
Multilateral cooperation must be underpinned by fair competition, predictability, and sustainability. In this regard, we reaffirm our attachment to transparency, to coordination, and to the respect of WTO rules in our respective policies. We will step up our efforts towards a global level playing field and reiterate our commitment to keep our economies open and competitive. We will also tackle non-market policies and practices, such as harmful subsidies, including by State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and forced technology transfers, notably when these policies and practices are used targeting sectors for dominance. We commit to effectively use our trade tools, including new ones, as appropriate, to identify, challenge, and counter these practices, and to promote stronger international rules and norms, together with partners.
Acknowledging the important role of trade in addressing global environmental challenges, we will support WTO deliberations that contribute to achieve COP28 commitments, including plurilateral initiatives such as those facilitating and promoting trade in environmental goods, services and technologies, and fighting plastic pollution.
We acknowledge that our trade policies, as well as public and private investments in the industries of the future, both at home and around the world, will play a major role in achieving common goals of addressing the climate crisis and accelerating the global clean energy transition. We also acknowledge that further cooperation is necessary to fill the investment gap for the clean energy transition to lower the cost of the energy transition worldwide. In this context, we stress that, in driving the clean energy economy of the future, we will cooperate openly and transparently in a coordinated manner, reflecting our joint commitment not to act at each other's expense.
We will continue to promote inclusive trade recognizing the unique challenges that underrepresented groups, including women and indigenous peoples, face, and their role to ensuring sustainable economic growth.
Economic Resilience and Economic Security 
Building on the progress we made on our strategic coordination since Hiroshima, we reinforce our commitment to promote economic resilience and economic security, in partnership and cooperation within and beyond the G7. In particular, we are building resilient economies and supply chains, ensuring our toolkits to respond to harmful practices are fit for purpose, and safeguarding critical and emerging technology that could be used to threaten international peace and security.
Recognizing that economic resilience requires de-risking through diversification and reduction of critical dependencies, including those resulting from overcapacity, we will implement the principles on resilient and reliable supply chains, namely transparency, diversification, security, sustainability, trustworthiness and reliability. We will do so by actively engaging with partners and the private sector, within and beyond the G7, while preserving economic dynamism and openness. We encourage the public and private sectors to make coordinated efforts to strengthen the supply chains resilience of strategic goods, in terms of both supply and demand. This will include seeking to collectively identify critical goods, strategic sectors, and supply chains, for future coordination within the G7 on relevant criteria that take into account not only economic factors, but also factors linked to the principles above.
We will champion initiatives to increase participation of a broader range of low- and middle-income countries in Africa and elsewhere in global supply chains, while promoting high standards and creating benefits for local workers and communities everywhere. We will also reduce our partners' vulnerability. We reaffirm the need to accelerate coordinated initiatives on critical minerals such as the Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE), the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) and its MSP Forum.
We are more committed than ever to work together to address harmful market distortions and global excess capacity in key sectors resulting from non-market policies and practices, such as pervasive, opaque and harmful industrial subsidies, market distortive practices of SOEs and all forms of forced technology transfers. We acknowledge that such practices not only undermine the free and fair rules-based international economic order, but may also exacerbate strategic dependencies and vulnerabilities, and hinder emerging and developing countries' sustainable development.
Against this background, we will ensure that our toolkits are fit for purpose and strengthen our coordination. We will pursue joint monitoring to assess how non-market policies and practices are producing harmful overcapacities and other spillover effects. We commit to strengthen the exchange of information, including with like-minded countries, and consult on our respective responses, with a view to greater effectiveness, while avoiding unintended negative effects and considering the security of supply chains. We will intensify diplomatic efforts with those contributing to overcapacity to address the issue at its source, while engaging developing countries and emerging markets to collaborate towards a more equitable global trade and investment environment.
We will work together with partners to ensure that attempts or threats to weaponize economic dependencies will fail and stand ready to take actions, where necessary, against economic coercion. We will increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence, and response, developing new tools, as appropriate, in line with our respective legal systems and international law. We will address potential, emerging, and ongoing cases, including through the G7 Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion, with partners beyond the G7. We will also support, as appropriate, targeted states, economies, and entities and we task the Platform to actively monitor areas of concern and key threats.
We recognize that evolving technologies present opportunities, but also risks. Recognizing that rapid advances are changing the nature of dual-use technology, we will promote efforts to ensure that gaps in our dual-use technology protection ecosystem cannot be exploited. We will ensure that our tools are sufficiently flexible to keep pace with the rapid development of new technologies, while avoiding undue restrictions on international trade and investment. We have a common interest in preventing a narrow set of technological advances that are assessed to be core to enhancing the military and intelligence capabilities of actors who may use these capabilities to undermine international peace and security, from being fueled by our companies' capital, expertise and knowledge.
Today we are taking the following steps:
We welcome the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM) in May, that facilitated our collaboration on economic resilience and economic security among like-minded countries beyond the G7.
Health 
We will continue promoting a One Health approach, bolstering prevention and health systems, further contributing to achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and promoting equitable access to quality health services and essential medical countermeasures (MCMs). We reaffirm our commitment to accelerating progress towards SDG 3, ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. Furthermore, we recommit to ending HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, in particular by supporting the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as neglected tropical diseases and polio as public health threats by 2030, and countering climate change effects on infectious diseases, which are already seen globally, including in recent cholera and dengue outbreaks.
More broadly, we reaffirm the objectives of the COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health to transform health systems to be climate-resilient, equitable, low-carbon, and sustainable.
In this respect, we recognize the need to strengthen the Global Health Architecture (GHA), with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core. Strengthening the GHA and Pandemic, Preparedness and Response (PPR) requires public and private financing. We commit to strengthening coordination between Finance and Health tracks for pandemic PPR and to continue exploring innovative mechanisms for response financing including through the work of the G20 Joint Task Force on Finance and Health. We call for continued support to i) the Pandemic Fund, including expanding the donor base and calling for at least USD 2 billion in new pledges and co-financing that is equal or greater than that; ii) strengthening G7 collaboration to support regional diversification of development and manufacturing MCMs, including regional vaccines manufacturing initiatives, as well as last mile delivery as an essential element to enhance equity; iii) the conclusion of the process and the prompt operationalization of the pandemic preparedness component of the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST), in cooperation with the World Bank and WHO; and iv) impact investment initiatives such as the Impact Investment Initiative for Global Health.
Additionally, we welcome the MCM Surge Financing Initiative that relevant G7 DFIs, along with the European Investment Bank and the International Finance Corporation, are developing to build institutional capacity and ensure immediate financing to procure, produce and deliver MCMs in low- and middle-income countries during future pandemics. We welcome the development of new DFIs-led and shared MCM surge financing facilities in 2024. Relevant DFIs and IFIs intend to sign a Memorandum of Understanding this year, in coordination with other global and regional health organizations to make further progress on this initiative. We look forward to the sustainable replenishments of Gavi, as well as the WHO and the Global Fund.
We note the importance of strengthening alignment and collaboration across the global health financing ecosystem in support of country-led priorities towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) informed by the Conclusions of the Future of Global Health Initiatives Process.
We commit to advancing UHC and investing in resilient health systems, primary healthcare service delivery, and a skilled health workforce—including through the WHO Academy, the G20 Public Health Workforce Laboratorium, and the UHC Knowledge Hub. In this context, we commit to further promote comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all, and to advance maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health, especially for those in vulnerable circumstances.
We will continue supporting research efforts and leveraging emerging technologies, including the ethical use of AI, to develop new treatments and therapies, improve diagnostic tools and technologies, and address existing and emerging health challenges, while ensuring privacy and promoting interoperability.
We emphasize the importance of life-long prevention for healthy and active ageing, by promoting healthy lifestyles and science-based diet models based, to the extent possible, on locally grown products, beneficial for both human health and the environment, and tackling health determinants and non-communicable diseases, particularly mental health, and cancer.
We remain deeply concerned with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and other health challenges exacerbated by the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, including in low and middle-income countries. Ahead of the UNGA High-Level Meeting on AMR in September 2024, we will support an ambitious outcome document that champions the needs of low- and middle-income countries and include concrete goals and targets that galvanize action alongside the mandate for an evidence-based panel to continue to drive action on AMR. We will continue promoting equitable access to essential antibiotics and integrated actions to counter AMR within a One Health Framework, by exploring and implementing infection prevention and control measures, as well as exercising stewardship for prudent and appropriate use of antimicrobials, including surveillance of their use and consumption. We will also implement push and pull incentives, support public-private partnerships and explore innovative instruments to accelerate research and development on new antimicrobials, their alternatives, and diagnostics.
Gender Equality 
We reaffirm our commitment to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all their diversity, through full, equal, and meaningful participation in all spheres of society. We express our strong concern about the rollback of the rights of women, girls, and LGBTQIA+ people around the world in particular in time of crisis and we strongly condemn all violations and abuses of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. We will continue promoting, and protecting their rights in all spheres of society, and consistently mainstreaming gender equality in all policy areas. We will work with global partners to advance gender equality in multilateral fora.
We recommit to preventing and addressing hate and discrimination, and to eliminating sexual and gender-based violence, including that facilitated by technology and trafficking in persons. We will provide comprehensive support and meaningful participation for victims and survivors. We reiterate our commitments in the Hiroshima Leaders' Communiqué to universal access to adequate, affordable, and quality health services for women, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.
We continue to promote the full economic empowerment of all women and girls, and equal and meaningful participation and leadership in decision-making processes, including in the STEM sector. We will step up our efforts to address harmful gender norms, stereotypes, and practices, and to eliminate structural barriers and the gender pay gap, including through enhanced collaboration with the private sector and through supporting the adoption of gender equality certification systems for enterprises. We recognize the need to ensure affordable and quality childcare and long-term care services for all, support parenthood protection, promote work-life balance, and equal sharing of care responsibilities, to promote women's equal rights and to take a whole-of-society approach to address the demographic challenges faced by ageing societies. Against this background, we reiterate the importance of recognizing, reducing, and redistributing unpaid care work and rewarding paid care work adequately, guaranteeing care workers representation.
We will tackle the unequal gender distribution of care work, which contributes to gender inequalities. To this end, we aim by 2035 to support 200 million more women to join the workforce by investing in efforts to close the global gap in the availability of childcare, including through the World Bank Invest in Childcare Initiative.
We will promote applying a gender transformative, multi-sector approach to our foreign policy, humanitarian aid, and development cooperation, including on climate resilience, food security, education and migration. We commit to advance the Women, Peace, and Security Agenda, including its application to disaster risk reduction and eradicate all forms of gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, also by supporting women peacebuilders in conflict settings. We reiterate our commitment to collectively increase G7 ODA for gender equality and we will explore ways to do this at the nexus of climate change and gender, particularly in Africa.
Recognizing that quality education for all girls is the best predictor for future levels of equality, we must also promote access to safe, inclusive, and equitable quality education for all. Noting that 2024 is the African Union's Year of Education, we will enhance our partnership with African countries on girls' education, including through redoubling our efforts to meet the G7 Girls Education targets by 2026.
Recognizing the success of the 2X Challenge, we welcome the new commitment by Development and Multilateral Finance Institutions to invest at least USD 20 billion over three years in gender lens investing, encouraging investments at the nexus of gender and climate. We call upon other public and private actors to join the next 2X Challenge, advancing measurable changes and financing directed to women's empowerment.
We welcome the strengthened Gender Equality Advisory Council (GEAC) and its recommendations. Highlighting the importance of reliable sex and gender-disaggregated data collection and monitoring, we also welcome the updated G7 Dashboard on Gender Gaps.
Inclusion and Disability 
We are committed to ensuring that all individuals have equal rights to full and effective participation in social, cultural, educational, economic, and civil and political life. We intend to enhance all persons' talents and skills to make our communities stronger and more cohesive. We commit to further integrate disability rights across all political agendas, and in doing so, we welcome the first-ever G7 Inclusion and Disability Ministers meeting. We task our Ministers to launch the Solfagnano Charter, where they will articulate actions around universal access and accessibility, independent living, inclusive employment, service availability, emergency prevention and management, among others. We will step up our action for the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). We look forward to the Global Disability Summit to be held in Berlin in 2025.
Disarmament and Non-Proliferation 
We remain firmly committed to preventing the proliferation and use of all weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.
We are greatly concerned by Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and actions, as well as its reported increasing use of chemical agents against Ukrainian forces. We reiterate that any use of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. We remain concerned about China's opaque and accelerating expansion of its nuclear arsenal. We will continue working to address North Korea's and Iran's continued advancement of nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Recalling the G7 Leaders' Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament, we reaffirm our commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, with the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all, achieved through a realistic, pragmatic, and responsible approach. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We believe that the overall decline in global nuclear arsenals achieved since the end of the Cold War must continue and not be reversed.
We highlight the need to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) into force. In this regard, we call on Russia to continue to adhere to the moratorium on nuclear tests and renew the CTBT ratification. We also call on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) not to conduct any further nuclear tests, and to sign and ratify the CTBT.
We call for the immediate commencement of long-overdue negotiations within the Conference on Disarmament of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices (FMCT) while urging all nuclear weapons States that have not yet done so to declare and maintain voluntary moratoria on the production of such material.
We remain steadfast in our support of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), their universalization and full and effective implementation. We underline the importance of addressing biological threats worldwide. We will work to ensure that biological research, development, and innovation are conducted in a safe, secure, responsible, and sustainable manner.
We reiterate our commitment to the G7-led Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, a driving force behind global efforts to prevent, detect and respond to the acquisition and use of weapons of mass destruction by States and terrorists alike.
We are strengthening effective export controls on materials, technology, and research that could be used for military purposes in a way that keeps pace with rapid technological developments and recognizes the central role of multilateral export control regimes as a key non-proliferation instrument and safeguard for international peace and security.
We reiterate our commitment to safe, peaceful, responsible, and sustainable use of outer space, upholding existing legal frameworks including the Outer Space Treaty. We remain committed to fostering international cooperation and transparency, as well as confidence building measures and norms of responsible behavior with the goal of improving space security for all States.
We affirm the obligation of all States Parties to fully comply with the Outer Space Treaty, including not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install such weapons on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space in any other manner.
Countering Terrorism, Violent Extremism and Transnational Organized Crime 
We condemn and counter terrorism and violent extremism in all their forms. We are determined to protect our societies' freedom and security, while upholding the rule of law and respecting human rights. We will continue to combat the financing of terrorism and terrorism propaganda, particularly the dissemination of terrorist content online. We will also promote information sharing, international cooperation, and capacity building, including in border management, to investigate and prosecute such crimes.
We reiterate our strong commitment to fighting transnational organized crime, breaking its business models, and dismantling its networks. Drug trafficking, smuggling of migrants, trafficking in persons and fraud are major sources of income for organized crime. We stand ready to work with other governments to address these transnational challenges, as well as crimes that affect the environment and against cultural heritage. Recalling our statement on Synthetic Drug Threats, including the significant health implications, we support the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats.
We also continue our unwavering commitment to tackling child sexual exploitation and abuse in all its forms to keep children safe online and in our communities around the world. It is crucial that all sectors, including the tech sector, step up and play their part in prioritizing child safety and working to combat this horrific crime.
Safeguarding Democratic Processes 
In a year during which millions worldwide choose their leaders and representatives, we reaffirm our commitment to safeguard democratic values and human rights. With the rapid evolution of emerging technology, we are more concerned than ever about Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) in our democratic institutions and processes, and how attempted interference campaigns, malicious cyber activities, and transnational repression collectively undermine sovereignty and democratic values.
We pledge to strengthen our coordinated efforts to better prevent, detect, and respond to FIMI threats through human rights-respecting practices and by supporting freedom of expression and free, independent, and pluralistic media. We ask our relevant Ministers to bolster the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism by creating by the end of the year a collective response framework to counter foreign threats to democracies, including publically exposing foreign operations of information manipulation. We also call on tech companies, in particular social media platforms, to intensify their efforts to prevent and counter FIMI campaigns and the potential abuse of AI for this purpose and work towards higher standards of transparency and accountability on these issues.
We will continue our cooperation with governments and non-governmental partners to work towards the promotion of fact-based, quality, and trustworthy information and will support relevant international initiatives, in particular in the UN and OECD.
Anti-corruption 
Corruption and related illicit finance drain public resources, fuel organized crime, and undermine democratic governance and progress across the SDGs. We endorse the G7 High-Level Principles on Anti-Corruption and commit to promoting technical assistance and capacity building to address existing gaps. We reaffirm the fundamental role that the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) plays in the global fight against corruption and commit to further enhance the effectiveness of its Implementation Review Mechanism. We underscore the importance of denying corrupt actors access to our territories and financial systems.
Conclusions
We appreciate the exchanges with, and the inputs from, the G7 Engagement Groups. We are furthermore grateful for the valuable contributions from the Heads of the AfDB, the IMF, the OECD, the UN, and the WB, who joined us in Apulia.
We look forward to the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games, and urge all countries to observe the Olympic Truce individually and collectively, as prescribed by the United Nations General Assembly Resolution ""Building a peaceful and better world through sports and the Olympic ideal"" adopted on 15 November 2023.	Joint Statement by Group of Seven (G-7) Nation Leaders—G7 Apulia Leaders' Communiqué"
"Jun 16, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-observance-eid-al-adha-3,Statement on the Observance of Eid al-Adha,"""Jill and I wish American Muslims—and Muslims around the world—a very blessed Eid al-Adha.
This holiday is a time of prayer, reflection, and sacrifice, with Muslims spending time with family and friends, joining in festive meals, sharing food with those in need, and honoring the performance of the annual Hajj rituals. This year, nearly 2 million Muslims from every corner of the world are participating in Hajj, a sacred journey that brings Muslims from all walks of life together in fellowship and faith. We wish them Hajj Mabroor.
The Hajj and Eid al-Adha remind us of our equality before God and the importance of community and charity, values that speak directly to the American character. The United States is blessed to be home to millions of American Muslims who enrich our Nation in countless ways, from medicine to technology, education, public service, the arts, and beyond. Many American Muslims serve in my administration—more than in all previous administrations combined—and I'm the first President to nominate American Muslims to the Federal judiciary. I'm grateful every day for their hard work on behalf of the American people. American Muslims are our neighbors, family, friends, and fellow citizens. They make our Nation stronger.
This year, Eid al-Adha comes at a difficult time for many Muslims around the world. In Gaza, innocent civilians are suffering the horrors of the war between Hamas and Israel. Too many innocent people have been killed, including thousands of children. Families have fled their homes and seen their communities destroyed. Their pain is immense. My administration is doing everything we can to bring an end to the war, free all hostages, deliver humanitarian relief, and work toward a future two-state solution, which I continue to believe is the only way to achieve a lasting peace for Palestinians and Israelis. And I strongly believe that the three-phase cease-fire proposal Israel has made to Hamas and that the U.N. Security Council has endorsed is the best way to end the violence in Gaza and ultimately end the war.
We're also working to bring a peaceful resolution to the horrific conflict in Sudan. And we continue to advocate for the rights of other Muslim communities—including the Rohingya in Burma and the Uyghurs in the People's Republic of China—facing persecution around the world. They, like all people, deserve to live free from violence and fear.
That's why I'm committed to addressing the scourge of Islamophobia in the United States. Hate has no place in America, whether it is targeted at American Muslims, Arab Americans including Palestinians, or anyone else. My administration is creating a national strategy to counter Islamophobia and related forms of bias and discrimination, which affect not only Muslims, but also Arab, Sikh, and South Asian Americans. At our best, the United States is a place where everyone is treated with respect, everyone's equal humanity is cherished, and our differences are seen as the source of strength that they are.
In the spirit of Eid al-Adha, let us all renew our commitment to values that unite us—compassion, empathy, and mutual respect—which are both American and Islamic. We look forward to welcoming home our American Muslim pilgrims who have earned the title ""Al-Hajj."" To them and all Muslims across the globe, we wish you a blessed and meaningful holiday. Eid Mubarak!""	Statement on the Observance of Eid al-Adha"

TAPPER: Now, please welcome the 46th of the United States, Joe Biden.
BIDEN: Folks, how are you? Good to be here. Thank you.
TAPPER: And please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump.
Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here.
Let's begin the debate. And let's start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy.
President Biden, inflation has slowed, but prices remain high. Since you took office, the price of essentials has increased. For example, a basket of groceries that cost $100, then, now costs more than $120. And typical home prices have jumped more than 30 percent.
What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?
BIDEN: We've got to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me.
We had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic was so badly handled. Many people were dying. All he said was it's not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm. You'll be all right.
The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible.
And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. And that's exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought out in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.
But there's more to be done. There's more to be done. Working-class people are still in trouble.
I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come of household where the kitchen table – if things weren't able to be met during the month, was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.
That's why I'm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems, and we're going to make sure that we have reduced the price of housing. We're going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We're going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can't take over.
The combination of what I was left with and corporate greed are the reason why we're in this problem right now.
In addition to that, we're in a situation where if you had to take a look at all that was done at his administration, he didn't do much at all. By the time he left, there's – things were in chaos, literally chaos.
And so we put things back together. We created, as I said, those jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now – we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for – for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug, all the drugs they can include (ph) beginning next year.
And the situation is making – and we're going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we're working to bring down the price of – around the kitchen table. And that's what we're going to get done.
TAPPER: Thank you.
President Trump?
TRUMP: We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We have never done so well. Every – everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us.
We got hit with COVID. And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn't end up in a Great Depression, the likes of which we had in 1929. By the time we finished – so we did a great job. We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good.
But the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates – that was a disaster for our country.
But other than that, we had – we had given them back a – a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID. And nobody thought that was even possible. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce-back jobs, they're bounced back from the COVID.
He has not done a good job. He has done a poor job. And inflation's killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.
TAPPER: Thank you.
President Biden?
BIDEN: Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he's the only one who thinks that, I think. I don't know anybody else who thinks it was great – he had the greatest economy in the world.
And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy, he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term. He's the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover. The idea that he did something that was significant.
And the military, you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan. And he didn't do anything about that. When he was president, we were still finding ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country. The truth is, I'm the only president this century that doesn't have any this – this decade, that doesn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did.
TAPPER: President Trump, I want to follow up, if I can, you want –
[crosstalk]
TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to him?
TAPPER: Well, I'm going to ask you a follow-up. You can do whatever you want with the minute that we give you. I want to follow up. You want to impose a 10 percent tariff on all goods coming into the U.S. How will you ensure that that doesn't drive prices even higher?
TRUMP: It's not going to drive them higher. It's just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China – and many others, in all fairness to China – it's going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously, and give us a lot of power for other things.
But he – he made a statement. The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history. And that's why we had all the jobs. And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he's taking credit for bounce-back jobs. You can't do that.
He also said he inherited 9 percent inflation. No, he inherited almost no inflation, and it stayed that way for 14 months. And then it blew up under his leadership because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn't know what they were doing. And they don't know what they were doing. It was the worst – probably the worst administration in history. There's never been.
And as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power. He got out, it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country's life.
TAPPER: President Trump, over the last eight years, under both of your administrations, the national debt soared to record highs. And according to a new non-partisan analysis, President Trump, your administration approved $8.4 trillion in new debt.
While so far, President Biden, you've approved $4.3 trillion in new debt.
So former President Trump, many of the tax cuts that you signed into law are set to expire next year. You want to extend them and go even further, you say. With the U.S. facing trillion-dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?
TRUMP: Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we've ever seen just prior to COVID, and even after COVID. It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred – that tax spurred. Now, when we cut the taxes, as example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that, we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country.
The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with, we – we gave him something great.
Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it.
Something which a lot of people don't like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration.
He did the mandate, which is a disaster, mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job.
And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we're no longer respected as a country. They don't respect our leadership. They don't respect the United States anymore.
We're like a Third World nation between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent. All of the things he's done. We've become like a Third World nation, and it's a shame.
The damage he's done to our country – and I'd love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails, and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.
TAPPER: President Trump, we will get to immigration later in this block. President Biden, I want to give you an opportunity to respond to this question about the national debt.
BIDEN: He had the largest national debt of any president in a four-your period, number one. Number two, he – that $2 trillion tax cut benefited the very wealthy. I – what I'm going to do is fix the tax system.
For example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America – I mean, billionaires in America. And what's happening? They're in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they'd raised $500 million – billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period.
We'd be able to right wipe out his debt. We'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do – childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the – with – with – with the COVID. Excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with – look, if – we finally beat Medicare.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Biden. President Trump?
TRUMP: Well, he's right. He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death. And he's destroying Medicare because all of these people are coming in, they're putting them on Medicare. They're putting them on Social Security. They're going to destroy Social Security.
This man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security. These millions and millions of people coming in, they're trying to put them on Social Security. He will wipe out Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare. So he was right in the way he finished that sentence. And it's a shame.
What's happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed. Foreign countries, I'm friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We're no longer respected. They don't like us.
We give them everything they want, and they think we're stupid. They think we're very stupid people.
What we're doing for other countries, and they do nothing for us. What this man has done is absolutely criminal.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.
Dana?
BASH: This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. This morning, the court ruled on yet another abortion case, temporarily allowing emergency abortions to continue in Idaho, despite that state's restrictive ban.
Former President Trump, you take credit for the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which returned the issue of abortion to the states.
TRUMP: Correct.
BASH: However, the federal government still plays a role in whether or not women have access to abortion pills. They're used in about two-thirds of all abortions.
As president, would you block abortion medication?
TRUMP: First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.
And if you look at this whole question that you're asking, a complex, but not really complex.
Fifty-one years ago, you had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives. Everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders.
And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.
Now, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this are getting into other things, but every legal scholar, throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that.
Now the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was – it was – it was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas, I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different.
But they're all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That's the vote of the people.
Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions, I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it's important to believe in the exceptions. Some people, you have to follow your heart, some people don't believe in that.
But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. I think it's very important. Some people don't. Follow your heart.
But you have to get elected also and – because that has to do with other things. You've got to get elected.
The problem they have is they're radical because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth – after birth.
If you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we'll put the baby aside and we'll determine what we do with the baby. Meaning, we'll kill the baby.
What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue. It's been a great thing.
BASH: Thank you.
President Biden?
BIDEN: It's been a terrible thing, what you've done.
The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided, supported Roe. And that was – that's – this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous.
And this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it. We're (ph) in a state where in six weeks, you don't even know whether you're pregnant or not, but you cannot see the doctor or have your – and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help.
The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we're going to turn civil rights back to the states. Let each state have a different rule.
Look, there's so many young women who have been – including a young woman who just was murdered and he – he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by a – by –by an immigrant coming in, and they talk about that. But here's the deal, there's a lot of young women who are being raped by their – by their in-laws, by their – by their spouses, brothers and sisters, by – just – it's just – it's just ridiculous. And they can do nothing about it.
And they tried to arrest them when they cross state lines.
BASH: Thank you.
TRUMP: There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border. We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world – considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world. And he opened it up, and these killers are coming into our country. And they are raping and killing women, and it's a terrible thing.
As far as the abortion is concerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting. In many cases, they – it's frankly a very liberal decision. In many cases, it's the opposite.
But they're voting. And it's bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders, if they knew about this issue, which frankly they didn't. But they would have – everybody want it brought back.
Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back. He wasn't able to get it.
Everybody wanted it brought back and many presidents had tried to get it back. I was the one to do it.
And again, this gives it the vote of the people. And that's where they wanted it. Every legal scholar wanted it that way.
BASH: Staying on the topic of abortion, President Biden. Seven states –
BIDEN: [off-mike]
BASH: I'll let you do that. This is the same topic.
Seven states have no legal restrictions on how far into a pregnancy a woman can obtain an abortion. Do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy?
BIDEN: I supported Roe v. Wade, which had three trimesters. First time is between a woman and a doctor. Second time is between the doctor and an extreme situation. And a third time is between the doctor – I mean, it'd be between the woman and the state.
The idea that the politicians – that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about women's health is ridiculous. That's the last – no politician should be making that decision.
A doctor should be making those decisions. That's how it should be run. That's what you're going to do.
And if I'm elected, I'm going to restore Roe v. Wade.
TRUMP: So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states – Democrat-run – take it after birth. Again, the governor – former governor of Virginia: put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it.
So he's in – he's willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.
Nobody wants that to happen. Democrat –
BIDEN: [off-mike] No.
TRUMP: – or Republican, nobody wants it to happen.
BIDEN: [off-mike] You're lying.
That is simply not true. That Roe v. Wade does not provide for that. That's not the circumstance. Only when the woman's life is in danger, if she's going to die – that's the only circumstance in which that can happen.
But we are not for late term abortion, period – period, period.
TRUMP: Under Roe v. Wade, you have late term abortion. You can do whatever you want, depending on the state. You can do whatever you want. We don't think that's a good thing. We think it's a radical thing.
We think the Democrats are the radicals, not the Republicans.
BIDEN: For 51 years, that was the law. Fifty-one years, Constitutional Scholarship said it was the right way to go. Fifty-one years, and it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court. He takes credit for taking it away.
What's he going to do? What's he going to do, in fact, if – if the MAGA Republicans – he gets elected and the MAGA Republicans control of the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion, period, across the board, at six weeks, or seven, or eight or ten weeks, something very, very conservative. Is he going to sign that bill?
I'll veto it. He'll sign it.
BASH: Thank you.
TRUMP: [off-mike]
TAPPER: Let's turn now to the issue of immigration and border security. President Biden, a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch, overwhelming border states and overburdening cities such as New York and Chicago, and in some cases causing real safety and security concerns.
Given that, why should voters trust you to solve this crisis?
BIDEN: Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that, but it made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now. We significantly increased the number of asylum officers. Significantly – by the way, the Border Patrol men endorsed me, endorsed my position.
In addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where, when he was president, he was taking – separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated. That's not the right way to go.
What I've done – since I've changed the law, what's happened? I've changed it in a way that now you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally. That's better than when he left office.
And I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the – the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers.
TAPPER: President Trump?
TRUMP: I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said either.
Look, we had the safest border in the history of our country. The border – all he had to do was leave it. All he had to do was leave it. He decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylum, terrorists.
We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists all over the world, not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere, all over the world. They're pouring in. And this guy just left it open.
And he didn't need legislation. Because I didn't have legislation, I said close the border. We had the safest border in history. In that final couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol, who is great – and, by the way, who endorsed me for president. But I won't say that. But they endorsed me for president. Brandon, just speak to him.
But look, we had the safest border in history. Now we have the worst border in history. There's never been anything like it. And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Trump. President Biden?
BIDEN: The only terrorist who has done anything crossing the border is one who came along and killed three under his administration, killed – an al-Qaida person in his administration, killed three American soldiers – killed three American soldiers. That's the only terrorist that's there.
I'm not saying no terrorist ever got through. But the idea they're emptying their prisons, we're welcoming these people, that's simply not true. There's no data to support what he said. Once again, he's exaggerating. He's lying.
TAPPER: President Trump, staying on the topic of immigration, you've said that you're going to carry out, quote, ""the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,"" unquote.
Does that mean that you will deport every undocumented immigrant in America, including those who have jobs, including those whose spouses are citizens, and including those who have lived here for decades? And if so, how will you do it?
TRUMP: Just one second. He said we killed three people. The people we killed are al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two greatest terrorists – biggest terrorists anywhere in the world, and it had a huge impact on everything, not just border, on everything.
He's the one that killed people with the bad water, including hundreds of thousands of people dying and also killing our citizens when they come in. We – we are living right now in a rat's nest. They're killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union because we don't have borders anymore. Every state is now a border.
And because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen. We call it migrant crime. I call it Biden migrant crime. They're killing our citizens at a level that we've never seen before. And you're reading it, like these three incredible young girls over the last few days.
One of them, I just spoke to the mother, and they just had the funeral for this girl, 12 years old. This is horrible, what's taken place. What's taken place in our country – we're literally an uncivilized country now. He doesn't want it to be. He just doesn't know.
He opened the borders, nobody's ever seen anything like. And we have to get a lot of these people out and we have to get them out fast, because they're going to destroy our country.
Just take a look at where they're living. They're living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places. Our veterans are on the street. They're dying, because he doesn't care about our veterans. He doesn't care. He doesn't like the military, at all. And he doesn't care about our veterans.
Nobody had been worse. I had the highest approval rating for veterans, taking care of the V.A. He has the worst. He's gotten rid of all the things that I approved – Choice, that I got through Congress. All of the different things I approved, they abandoned.
We had, by far, the highest, and now it's down in less than half because he's done – all these great things that we did – and I think he did it just because I approved it, which is crazy. But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing –
TAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.
TRUMP: – all of these people to come in.
TAPPER: President Biden –
TRUMP: And it's a very sad day in America.
TAPPER: President Biden, you have the mic.
BIDEN: Every single thing he said is a lie, every single one. For example, veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PACT Act. One million of them now have insurance, and their families have it. And their families have it, because what happened, whether was Agent Orange or burn pits, they're all being covered now. And he – his group opposed that.
We're also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans. My – my son spent a year in Iraq, living next to one of those burn pits, came back with stage four glioblastoma. I was recently in – in – in France for D-Day, and I spoke to all – about those heroes that died. I went to the World War II cemetery – World War I cemetery he refused to go to. He was standing with his four-star general, and he told him – he said, ""I don't want to go in there because they're a bunch of losers and suckers.""
My son was not a loser. He was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser.
TAPPER: President Trump?
TRUMP: First of all, that was a made-up quote, ""suckers and losers."" They made it up. It was in a third-rate magazine that's failing, like many of these magazines. He made that up. He put it in commercials. We've notified 'em.
We had 19 people that said I didn't say it. And think of this, who would say – I'm at a cemetery, or I'm talking about our veterans – because nobody's taken better care – I'm so glad this came up, and he brought it up. There's nobody that's taken better care of our soldiers than I have.
To think that I would, in front of generals and others, say suckers and losers – we have 19 people that said it was never said by me. It was made up by him, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up, just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up, just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking.
It's the same thing. Fifty-one intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation. It wasn't. That came from his son, Hunter. It wasn't Russia disinformation. He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now.
BIDEN: You had a four-star general stand at your side, who was on your staff, who said you said it, period. That's number one.
And, number two, the idea – the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the lines. We've done more for veterans than any president has in American history – American history. And they now – and their family. The only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home, and their families, and equip them when they go to war.
That's what we're doing. That's what the V.A. is doing now. They're doing more for veterans than ever before in our history.
TAPPER: All right. Thank you so much.
BASH: Let's move to the topic of foreign policy. I want to begin with Russia's war against Ukraine, which is now in its third year.
Former President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin says he'll only end this war if Russia keeps the Ukrainian territory it has already claimed and Ukraine abandons its bid to join NATO.
Are Putin's terms acceptable to you?
TRUMP: First of all, our veterans and our soldiers can't stand this guy. They can't stand him. They think he's the worst commander in chief, if that's what you call him, that we've ever had. They can't stand him. So let's get that straight. And they like me more than just about any of them. And that's based on every single bit of information.
As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew – that was respected by Putin, he would have never – he would have never invaded Ukraine. A lot of people are dead right now, much more than people know.
You know, they talk about numbers. You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers. He did nothing to stop it. In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in.
I'll tell you what happened. He was so bad with Afghanistan; it was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should – he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned. And so he's got no love lost. But he should have fired those generals.
No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind; we lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated. And by the way, we left people behind too. We left American citizens behind.
When Putin saw that, he said, you know what, I think we're going to go in and maybe take my – this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never. Just like Israel would have never been invaded in a million years by Hamas. You know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn't let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything. No money for terror.
That's why you had no terror at all during my administration. This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.
BASH: President Biden.
BIDEN: I've never heard so much malarkey in my whole life. Look, the fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where – let's take the last point first, Iran attacked American troops, killed, caused brain damage for a number of these troops, and he did nothing about it. Recently, when he was president, they attacked. He said, they're just having headaches. That's all it is. We didn't do a thing when the attack took place. Number one.
Number two, we got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift. Number three, we found ourselves in a situation where, if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine, he's – this guy told Ukraine – told Trump, do whatever you want and do whatever you want. And that's exactly what Trump did to Putin, encouraged him, do whatever you want. And he went in.
And listen to what he said when he went in, he was going to take Kyiv in five days, remember? Because it's part of the old Soviet Union. That's what he wanted to re-establish Kyiv. And he in fact, didn't do it at all. He didn't – wasn't able to get it done. And they've lost over – they've lost thousands and thousands of troops, 500,000 troops.
BASH: Thank you. President Trump –
TRUMP: I never said that.
BASH: – come back to you for one minute. I just want to go back to my original question, which is, are Putin's terms acceptable to you, keeping the territory in Ukraine?
TRUMP: No, they're not acceptable. No, they're not acceptable. But look, this is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war, he led everybody along. He's given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine. He's given $200 billion. That's a lot of money. I don't think there's ever been anything like it. Every time that Zelenskyy comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion dollars, he's the greatest salesman ever.
And I'm not knocking him, I'm not knocking anything. I'm only saying, the money that we're spending on this war, and we shouldn't be spending, it should have never happened. I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelenskyy as president-elect before I take office on January 20th. I'll have that war settled.
People being killed so needlessly, so stupidly, and I will get it settled and I'll get it settled fast before I take office.
BASH: President Biden, you have a minute.
BIDEN: The fact is that Putin is a war criminal. He's killed thousands and thousands of people. And he has made one thing clear, he wants to re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire, not just a piece, he wants all of Ukraine. That's what he wants. And then do you think he'll stop there? Do you think he'll stop when he – if he takes Ukraine? What do you think happens to Poland? What do you think of Belarus? What do you think happens to those NATO countries?
And so, if you want a war, you ought to find out what he's going to do. Because if, in fact, he does what he says and walks away – by the way, all that money we give Ukraine and from weapons we make here in the United States, we give them the weapons, not the money at this point. And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have. That's why it's – that's why we're strong.
BASH: Thank you. Moving on to the Middle East. In October, Hamas attacked Israel, killing more than a thousand people and taking hundreds of hostages. Among those held and thought to still be alive are five Americans. Israel's response has killed thousands of Palestinians and created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
President Biden, you've put forward a proposal to resolve this conflict. But so far, Hamas has not released the remaining hostages and Israel is continuing its military offensive in Gaza. So, what additional leverage will you use to get Hamas and Israel to end the war? You have two minutes.
BIDEN: Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7 to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward, endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it.
The first stage is to treat the hostages for a ceasefire. Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions. The third phase is know the end of the war. The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas, number one. They're the only ones standing down (ph).
We're still pushing hard from – to get them to accept. In the meantime, what's happened in Israel? We're finally – the only thing I've denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs. They don't work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them. And by the way, I'm the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown kind of ballistic missile attack on Israel. No one was hurt. No one Israeli was accidentally killed. And it stopped. We saved Israel. We are the biggest producer of support for Israel than anyone in the world. And so, that's – they are two different things.
Hamas cannot be allowed to be continued. We continue to send our experts and our intelligence people to how they can get Hamas like we did Bin Laden. You don't have to do it. And by the way, they've been greatly weakened, Hamas, greatly weakened, and they should be. They should be eliminated. But, you got to be careful for what you use these certain weapons among population centers.
TRUMP: Just going back to Ukraine for one second. We have an ocean separating us. The European nations together have spent $100 billion or maybe more than that, less than us. Why doesn't he call them so you got to put up your money like I did with NATO? I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. The Secretary General of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I've ever seen. You wouldn't – they wouldn't have any – they were going out of business. We were spending – almost 100 percent of the money was paid by us. He didn't do that. He is getting all – you got to ask these people to put up the money. We're over $100 billion more spent, and it has a bigger impact on them, because of location, because we have an ocean in between.
You got to ask him, as far as Israel and Hamas, Israel is the one that wants to go. He said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas. Actually, Israel is the one, and you should them go and let them finish the job. He doesn't want to do it. He has become like a Palestinian. But, they don't like him because he is a very bad Palestinian. He is a weak one.
BASH: President Biden, you have a minute.
BIDEN: I've never heard so much foolishness. This a guy who wants to get out of NATO. You're going to stay in NATO or you're going to pull out of NATO? The idea that we have – our strength lies in our alliances as well. It may be a big ocean, but we're ever able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe? What happens if in fact you have Putin continue to go into NATO? We have an Article Five agreement, attack on one is attack on all. You want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about. Go ahead. Let Putin go in and control Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places. See what happens then.
He has no idea what the hell he is talking about. And by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea, because they understand that this was this – this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace. No major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe.
BASH: President Trump, just a follow-up, would you support the creation of an independent Palestinian state in order to achieve peace in the region?
TRUMP: I'd have to see. But, before we do that, the problem we have is that we spend all the money. So, they kill us on trade. I made great trade deals with the European nations, because if you add them up, they're about the same size economically. Their economy is about the same size as the United States. And they were with (ph) no cars. No. They don't want anything that we have. But, we're supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture. I changed that.
But, the big thing I changed is they don't want to pay. And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said, and he is right about this, I said, no, I'm not going to support NATO if you don't pay. They asked me that question. Would you guard us against Russia at a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time? And they said, no, if you don't pay, I won't do that. And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months. But now, we're in the same position. We're paying everybody's bills.
BASH: Thank you.
TAPPER: Let's turn to the issue of democracy. Former President Trump, I want to ask you about January 6, 2021. After you rallied your supporters that day, some of them stormed the Capitol to stop the constitutionally mandated counting of electoral votes. As President, you swore an oath to quote, ""preserve, protect and defend"", unquote, the Constitution. What do you say to voters who believe that you violated that oath through your actions and inaction on January 6 and worry that you'll do it again?
TRUMP: Well, I don't think too many believe that. And let me tell you about January 6. On January 6, we had a great border, nobody coming through, very few. On January 6, we were energy independent. On January 6, we had the lowest taxes ever.
We had the lowest regulations ever. On January 6th, we were respected all over the world. All over the world, we were respected. And then he comes in and we're now laughed at. We're like a bunch of stupid people that – what happened to the United States's reputation under this man's leadership is horrible, including weaponization, which I'm sure at some point you'll be talking about where he goes after his political opponent because he can't beat them fair and square.
TAPPER: You have 80 seconds left. My question was, what do you say to those voters who believe that you violated your constitutional oath through your actions, inaction on January 6th, 2021, and worried that you'll do it again?
TRUMP: Well, I didn't say that to anybody. I said peacefully and patriotically. And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watched the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who's a documentary filmmaker, they say, what she's saying, oh, no, it's my responsibility, I was responsible for this. Because I offered them 10,000 soldiers or National Guard. And she turned them down. And the mayor of – in writing, by the way, the mayor, in writing turned it down, the mayor of D.C., they turned it down. I offered 10,000 because I could see – I had virtually nothing to do.
They asked me to go make a speech. I could see what was happening. Everybody was saying they're going to be there on January 6th. They're going to be there. And I said, you know what, that's a lot of people coming, you could feel it. You could feel it too. And you could feel it. And I said, they ought to have some National Guard or whatever. And I offered it to her. And she now admits that she turned it down. And it was the same day. She was – I don't know, you can't be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar. She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th.
TAPPER: President Biden?
BIDEN: Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one. I sat in that dining room off the Oval Office – he sat there for three hours, three hours watching, begging, being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues and Republicans as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it. Instead, he talked – they've talked about these people being patriots and – and great patrons of America.
In fact, he says he'll not forgive them for what they've done. They've been convicted. He says he wants to commute their sentences and say that, no, he went to every single court in the nation, I don't know how many cases, scores of cases, including the Supreme Court. And they said they said – they said, no, no, this guy, this guy is responsible for doing what is being – was done. He didn't do a damn thing. And these people should be in jail. And they should be the ones who are being held accountable. And he wants to let them all out.
And now he says if he loses again, such a whiner that he is, that there could be a bloodbath.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Biden.
President Trump?
TRUMP: What they've done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, what you have done, how you've destroyed the lives of so many people. When they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities, you go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they've done there with the fires all over the city, if I didn't bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed.
When you look at all of the – they took over big chunks of Seattle. I was all set to bring in the National Guard. They heard that. They saw them coming and they left immediately. What he said about this whole subject is so off. Peacefully patriotic.
One other thing, the ""unselect committee,"" which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now, out of office, and Democrats, all Democrats, they destroyed and deleted all of the information they found because they found out we were right. We were right. And they deleted and destroyed all of the information. They should go to jail for that.
If a Republican did that, they'd go to jail.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.
President Biden, I want to give you a minute.
BIDEN: The only person on this stage that is a convicted felon is the man I'm looking at right now. And the fact of the matter is he is – what he's telling you is simply not true. The fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up on Capitol Hill. And all those people, every one of those who were convicted deserves to be convicted. The idea that they didn't kill somebody, just went in and broke down doors, broke the windows, occupied offices, turned over desks, turned them over, statues, the idea that those people are patriots? Come on.
When I asked him about first of two debates we had – debates we had the first time around, I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys. He said, no, I'll tell them stand by. The idea he's refusing – will you denounce these guys? Will you denounce the people we're talking about now? You denounce the people who attacked that Capitol? What are you going to do?
TAPPER: I'm going to give you a – a minute, President Trump, for a follow-up question I have. After a jury convicted you of 34 felonies last month, you said if re-elected, you would, quote, ""have every right to go after,"" unquote, your political opponents. You just talked about members of the Select Committee on January 6th going to jail.
Your main political opponent is standing on stage with you tonight.
Can you clarify exactly what it means about you feeling you have every right to go after your political opponents?
TRUMP: Well, I said my retribution is going to be success. We're going to make this country successful again because right now it's a failing nation.
My retribution is going to be success. But when he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon at a very high level. His son is convicted. Going to be convicted probably numerous other times.
He should have been convicted before, but his Justice Department let the statute of limitations lapse on the most important things. But he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office.
Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he's done. He's done horrible things.
All of the death caused at the border, telling the Ukrainian people that, we're going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor. Otherwise, you're not getting a billion dollars.
If I ever said that, that's quid pro quo. That – we're not going to do anything. We're not going to give you a billion dollars unless you change your prosecutor having to do with his son.
This man is a criminal. This man – you're lucky. You're lucky. I did nothing wrong. We'd have a system that was rigged and disgusting. I did nothing wrong.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.
President Biden, you have said, I'm coming right to you, sir. You – well, you want to respond? Go ahead. I'll give you a minute to respond.
BIDEN: The idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you're talking about is outrageous. It's simply a lie, number one.
Number two, the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American, just because you're a president, is wrong, is simply wrong. No president's ever spoken like that before. No president in our history has spoken like that before.
Number three, the crimes that you are still charged with. And think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public, for doing a whole range of things, of having sex with a porn star on the night – and while your wife was pregnant?
I mean, what are you talking about? You have the morals of an alley cat.
TAPPER: Give you a minute, sir.
TRUMP: I didn't have sex with a porn star, number one.
Number two, that was a case that was started and moved. They moved a high-ranking official, a DOJ, into the Manhattan D.A.'s office to start that case. That case is going to be appealed in one.
We had a very terrible judge, horrible judge, Democrat. The prosecutor were all high-ranking Democrats appointed people and the – both the civil and a criminal.
He basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me. But when the public found out about these cases, because they understand it better than he does, he has no idea what these cases are, but when he – they – when they found out about these cases, you know what they did? My poll numbers went up way up. You know that because you're reporting it. And we took in more money in the last two weeks than we've ever taken in the history of any campaign.
I don't think any campaign has ever taken hundreds of millions of dollars came pouring in because the public knows it's a scam and it's a guy that's after his political opponent because he can't win fair and square.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.
President Biden, you have said, quote, Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy.
Do you believe that the tens of millions of Americans who are likely to vote for President Trump will be voting against American democracy?
BIDEN: The more they know about what he's done, yes. The more they know about what he's done.
And there's a lot more coming. He's got a lot of cases around the road coming around. He's got – he's got a whole range of issues he has to face. I don't know what the juries will do, but I do know – I do know he has a real problem.
And so the fact that – could you ever think you're hearing any president say that, I'm going to seek retribution? Do you ever hear any president say that, I thought it would write some good ideas?
What got me involved to run in the first place after my son had died, I decided – in Iraq – because of Iraq. I said, I wasn't going to run again, until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia. People coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches and singing the same anti-Semitic bile they sang back in Germany.
And what did – and the young woman got killed, they spoke to the mother. And she – they asked him, they said, what – well, what do you think of those people? The people who wanted to get killed, the ones who tried to stop it, and the ones who said, I think they're fine people on both sides.
What American president would ever say, Nazis coming out of fields, carrying torches, singing the same anti-Semitic bile, carrying swastikas, were fine people.
This is a guy who says Hitler's done some good things. I'd like to know what they are. The good things Hitler's done, that's what he said. This guy has no sense of American democracy.
TAPPER: President Trump.
TRUMP: Jake, both of you know that story has been totally wiped out because when you see the sentence, it said 100 percent exoneration on there. So he just keeps it going.
He says he ran because of Charlottesville. He didn't run because of Charlottesville. He ran because it was his last chance at – he's not equipped to be president. You know it and I know it.
It's ridiculous. We have a debate. We're trying to justify his presidency.
His presidency, his – without question, the worst president, the worst presidency in the history of our country. We shouldn't be having a debate about it. There's nothing to debate.
He made up the Charlottesville story and you'll see it's debunked all over the place. Every anchor has – every reasonable actor has debunked it.
And just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked. It's a nonsense story. He knows that.
And he didn't run because of Charlottesville. He used that as an excuse to run.
TAPPER: President Biden?
BIDEN: And debunk. It happened. All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time.
And the idea that somehow that's the only reason I ran. I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy can get elected.
If he thought they were good people coming out of that all – that for us, carrying those – those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn't deserve to be president, didn't deserve to be president at all.
And the idea that he's talking about all of this being fabricated, we saw it with our own eyes. We saw what happened on January 6. We saw the people breaking to the windows. We saw people occupying there.
His own vice president – look, there's a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused endorsing this time. His vice president hasn't endorsed him this time.
So, why? Why? They know him well. They serve with them. Why are they not endorsing him?
TAPPER: Thank you, President Biden.
We're going to be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate.
[commercial break]
BASH: Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate live from Georgia.
Let's talk about persistent challenges you both faced in your first terms, and you'd certainly face again in a second term. President Biden, while black unemployment dropped to a record low under your presidency, black families still earn far less than white families.
Black mothers are still three times more likely to die for pregnancy related causes. And black Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed that you haven't made more progress?
BIDEN: They acknowledge he made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history. Number two, the wages of black – black unemployment is the lowest level of spend in a long, long time. Number three, we find them – they're trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate – these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses.
And in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the – the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half. We've got to make sure we provide for childcare costs. We've got to make sure – because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the – in the job market.
So there's more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we've done a great deal so far and I'm not letting up and they know it.
BASH: You have 49 seconds left. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed with the progress so far?
BIDEN: I say, I don't blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any black family, first time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started.
I made sure that we're in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning, that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after 10 years. Millions have benefited from that and we're going to do a whole lot more for black families.
BASH: Thank you. President Trump?
TRUMP: And he caused the inflation. He's blaming inflation. And he's right, it's been very bad. He caused the inflation and it's killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It's killing people. They can't buy groceries anymore. They can't.
You look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can't live. They're not living anymore. He caused this inflation.
I gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his green news scam and all of the other – all this money that's being thrown out the window.
He caused inflation. As sure as you're sitting there, the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border. They're taking black jobs now and it could be 18. It could be 19 and even 20 million people. They're taking black jobs and they're taking Hispanic jobs and you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history.
BASH: Thank you. President Biden?
BIDEN: There was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back. 15% unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy. That's why there was no inflation at the time.
There were no jobs. We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were involved communities, including minority communities. We made sure that they have health insurance. We have covered with the ACA has increased. I made sure that they're $8,000 per person in the family to get written off in health care, but this guy wants to eliminate that. They tried 50 times. He wants to get rid of the ACA again, and they're going to try again if they win.
We find ourselves in a position where the idea that we're not doing any – I put more – we put more police on the street than any administration has. He wants to cut the cops. We're providing for equity, equity, and making sure people have a shot to make it. There is a lot going on. But, on inflation, he caused it by his tremendous amount of seasons in the way he handled the pandemic.
BASH: Thank you. Another persistent challenge is the climate crisis. 2023 was the hottest year in recorded history, and communities across the country are confronting the devastating effects of extreme heat, intensifying wildfires, stronger hurricanes, and rising sea levels.
Former President Trump, you've vowed to end your opponent's climate initiatives. But, will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?
TRUMP: Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police, how close the police are to him. Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump, almost every police group. And what he has done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators. We can't, in the 1990s (ph), we can't forget that. Super predators was his name. And he called it to them for 10, and they've taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening.
But, when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was – incredibly did a great job, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea. It's one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country, opportunity zones. And the biggest beneficiary are blacks. And that's why we have the best numbers with them. And maybe ever, if they're saying ever, I read this morning, wherever, the best numbers, he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics.
But, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they're going to take the jobs? And it's already started. And you haven't seen anything yet. It's a disaster.
BASH: 38 seconds left, President Trump. Will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?
TRUMP: So, I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever. And we did – we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever. And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually.
BIDEN: I don't know where the hell he has been. The idea that, Dana, he said is true. I've passed the most extensive, it was the extensive climate change legislation in history, in history. We find ourselves – and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don't have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing any white student can do. They just have the money. But now, they'll be able to get those jobs in high tech.
We're in a situation where the idea that he kind of is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water, the cleanest water? He had not done a damn thing with the environment. He – out of the Paris Peace Accord – Climate Accord, I immediately joined it, because if we reach for 1.5 degrees Celsius at any one point, well, there is no way back. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn't do a damn thing about it. He wants to undo all that I've done.
TRUMP: The Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars, and China nothing, and Russia nothing, and India nothing. It was a rip off of the United States. And I ended it because I didn't want to waste that money because they treat us horribly. We were the only ones who was costing us money. Nobody else was paying into it. And it was a disaster.
But, everything that he said just now, I'll give you an example. I heard him say before insulin, I'm the one that got the insulin down for the seniors. I took care of the seniors. What he is doing is destroying all of our medical programs because the migrants coming in. They want everybody. And look, I have the biggest heart on the stage. I guarantee you that. And I want to take care of people. But, we're destroying our country. They're taking over our schools, our hospitals, and they're going to be taking over Social Security. He is destroying Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
BIDEN: Where does that come from? The idea is that we, in fact – we were the only ones of consequence or not. We're not members of the Paris Accord. How can we do anything we're not able to, the United States can't get this under control? One of the largest polluters in the world. Number one, we're making significant progress. By 2035, we will have cut pollution in half.
We have – we have made significant progress. And we're continuing to make progress.
We set up a Climate Corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate, just like the Peace Corps. And we're going to – we're moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution.
But the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he's really concerned about – about pollution and about climate, I've not seen any indication of that.
And, by the way, with regard to prescription drugs, one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for – one, voluntarily. I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company, cannot have to pay.
BASH: Thank you.
BIDEN: And, by the way…
TAPPER: So every day millions of Americans struggle just to make ends meet. For many older Americans, Social Security provides a critical lifeline.
President Biden, if nothing is done to Social Security, seniors will see their benefits cut in just over 10 years. Will you name tonight one specific step that you're willing to take to keep Social Security solvent?
BIDEN: Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6 percent of their income, of their paycheck, every single time they get a paycheck, from the time of the first one they get when they're 18 years old.
The idea that they're going to – I'm not – I've been proposing that everybody, they pay – millionaires pay 1 percent – 1 percent. So no one after – I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000. After that, I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, by increasing from 1 percent beyond, to be able to guarantee the program for life.
TAPPER: So you still have 82 seconds left. Are there any other measures that you think that would be able to help keep Social Security solvent, or is just – is that one enough?
BIDEN: Well, that one enough will keep it solvent. But the biggest thing I'll do, if we defeat this man, because he wants to get rid of Social Security; he thinks that there's plenty to cut in Social Security. He's wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times. And that's with – and if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican Caucus that he, I believe, supports, is in fact wanting to cut it as well.
The idea that we don't need to protect our seniors is ridiculous. We put – and, by the way, the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before. And under the ACA, as I said, you're in a circumstance where 400,000 people – I mean, 40 million people – would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. The only thing that allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA.
And, by the way, the other thing is we're in a situation where I talk about education for black communities. I've raised the number, the amount of money for Pell grants by other $8,000 for anybody making under $70,000 a year, are going to be able to get $15,000 towards their tuition.
It's just – he – he just doesn't know what he's talking about.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Biden.
President Trump?
TRUMP: So I've dealt with politicians all my life. I've been on this side of the equation for the last eight years. I've never seen anybody lie like this guy. He lies – I've never seen it. He could look you in the face. So – and about so many other things, too.
And we mentioned the laptop, We mentioned ""Russia, Russia, Russia,"" ""Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine."" And everything he does is a lie. It's misinformation and disinformation. The ""losers and suckers"" story that he made up is a total lie on the military. It's a disgrace.
But Social Security, he's destroying it. Because millions of people are pouring into our country, and they're putting them on to Social Security; they're putting them on to Medicare, Medicaid. They're putting them in our hospitals. They're taking the place of our citizens.
They're – what they're doing to the V.A., to our veterans, is unbelievable. Our veterans are living in the street and these people are living in luxury hotels. He doesn't know what he's doing. And it – it's really coming back. I've never seen such anger in our country before.
TAPPER: President Biden?
BIDEN: The idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before – and, by the way, when I said ""suckers and losers,"" he said – he acknowledged after it that he fired that general. That general got fired because he's the one that acknowledged that that's what he said. He was the one standing with Trump when he said it, number one.
Number two, the idea that we're going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions, the way he talks about it, illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs, there's a reason why we have the fastest-growing economy in the world, a reason why we have the most successful economy in the world. We're doing better than any other nation in the world.
And, by the way, those 15 Nobel laureates, economists, they all said that if Trump is re-elected, we're likely to have a recession, and inflation is going to increasingly go up.
And by the way, worst president in history. 159 presidential scholars voted him the worst president in the history of the United States of America.
TAPPER: President Biden, thank you so much. Let's turn to the cost of childcare, which many American families struggle to afford.
President Trump, both you and President Biden have tried to address this issue, but the average cost of childcare in this country has risen to more than $11,000 a year per child. For many families, the cost of childcare for two children is more than their rent. In your second term, what would you do to make childcare more affordable?
TRUMP: Just to go back. The general got fired because he was no good. And if he said that, that's why he made it up. But we have 19 people that said I didn't say it, and they're very highly respected, much more so than him.
The other thing is, he doesn't fire people. He never fired people. I've never seen him fire anybody. I did fire a lot. I fired Comey because he was no good. I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp. They were no good. Not easy to fire people. You'd pay a price for it, but they were no good. I inherited these people. I didn't put him there. I didn't put Comey there. He was no good. I fired him.
This guy hasn't fired anybody. He never fires. He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan – the Afghanistan horror show. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. He didn't fire?
Did you fire anybody? Did you fire anybody that's on the border, that's allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world? Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from mental institutions? Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed? Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate. This shouldn't be a debate.
He is the worst president. He just said it about me because I said it. But look, he's the worst president in the history of our country. He's destroyed our country. Now, all of a sudden, he's trying to get a little tough on the border. He come out – came out with a nothing deal, and it reduced it a little bit. A little bit, like this much. It's insignificant.
He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters. And I don't think – we just can't let it happen. If he wins this election, our country doesn't have a chance. Not even a chance of coming out of this rut. We probably won't have a country left anymore. That's how bad it is. He is the worst in history by far.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Trump. President Biden?
BIDEN: We are the most admired country in the world. We're the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity. We have the finest military in the history of the world. The finest in the history of the world. No one thinks we're weak. No one wants to screw around with us. Nobody. Number one.
Number two, the idea that we're talking about worst presidents. I wasn't joking. Look it up. Go online. 159 or 58, don't hold me the exact number, presidential historians. They've had meetings and they voted who's the worst president in American history. One through best to worst. They said he was the worst in all of American history. That's a fact. That's not conjecture. He can argue the wrong, but that's what they voted.
The idea that he is knowing (ph) – doing anything to deal with child care. He did very – virtually nothing to child care. We should significantly increase the child care tax credit. We should significantly increase the availability of women and men for child or single parents to be able to go back to work, and we should encourage businesses to hold – to have child care facilities.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, the question was about what would you do to make child care more affordable? If you want to take your minute.
TRUMP: Just you understand, we have polling. We have other things that do – they rate him the worst because what he's done is so bad. And they rate me – yes, I'll show you. I will show you. And they rate me one of the best. OK.
And if I'm given another four years, I will be the best. I think I'll be the best. Nobody's ever created an economy like us. Nobody ever cut taxes like us. He's the only one I know. He wants to raise your taxes by four times. He wants to raise everybody's taxes by four times. He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so everybody, including the two of you are going to pay four to five times. Nobody ever heard of this before.
All my life I'd grow up and I'd see politicians talking about cutting taxes. When we cut taxes, as I said, we did more business. Apple and all these companies, they were bringing money back into our country. The worst president in history by far, and everybody knows it.
TAPPER: President Biden?
BIDEN: Look, the fact of the matter is that he's dead wrong about it. He's increased the tariff – he's increased – he will increase the taxes on middle class people. I said I'd never raise a tax on anybody making less than $400,000. I didn't.
But this tariff – these 10 percent tariffs, everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say? That's going to cost the average American $2,500 a year and more, because they're going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important.
Number two, he's in a situation where he talks about how he has not raised – he somehow helped the middle class. The middle class has been devastated by you. Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next ten years, which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country. You had the largest deficit of any president in American history, number one.
Number two, you have not, in fact, made any contact, any progress with China. We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Biden. Thank you, President Biden.
Let's discuss an epidemic impacting millions of Americans that both of you have made a top priority in your first term, the opioid crisis. And for both of you, the number of overdose deaths in this country has gone up. Under your term, it went up. Under your term, it has gone up.
Former President Trump, despite the efforts that both of you have made, more than 100,000 Americans are dying from overdoses every year, primarily from fentanyl and other opioids. What will you do to help Americans right now in the throes of addiction, who are struggling to get the treatment they need?
TRUMP: To finish up, we now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy, we have the largest deficit with China. He gets paid by China. He's a Manchurian Candidate. He gets money from China. So I think he's afraid to deal with him or something.
But do you notice? He never took out my tariffs because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China. He never took them away. He can't because it's too much money. It's tremendous. And we saved our steel industries. And there was more to come, but he hasn't done that.
But he hasn't cut the tariffs because he can't, because it's too much money. But he's got the largest deficit in the history of our country and he's got the worst situation with China. China is going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what they're doing to us as a country. They are killing us as a country, Joe, and you can't let that happen. You're destroying our country.
TAPPER: So, President Trump, you have 67 seconds left. The question was, what are you going to do to help Americans in the throes of addiction right now who are struggling to get the treatment they need?
TRUMP: Jake, we're doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along. We had the two-and-a-half, almost three years of like nobody's ever had before, any country in every way. And then we had to get tough. And it was – the drugs pouring across the border, we're – it started to increase.
We got great equipment. We bought the certain dog. That's the most incredible thing that you've ever seen, the way they can spot it. We did a lot. And we had – we were getting very low numbers. Very, very low numbers.
Then he came along. The numbers – have you seen the numbers now? It's not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low, because the gotaways, they don't even talk about gotaways. But the numbers of – the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women coming across our border, the worst thing I've ever seen at numbers – nobody's ever seen under him because the border is so bad. But the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we've ever had by far.
TAPPER: President Trump, thank you. President Biden?
BIDEN: Fentanyl and the byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while. And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl, these big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border, and it costs a lot of money. That was part of this deal we put together, this bipartisan deal.
More fentanyl machines, were able to detect drugs, more numbers of agents, more numbers of all the people at the border. And when we had that deal done, he went – he called his Republican colleagues said don't do it. It's going to hurt me politically.
He never argued. It's not a good bill. It's a really good bill. We need those machines. We need those machines. And we're coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl. And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don't have the technology to be able to put it together. That's what we have to do. We need those machines.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Biden. President Trump, and again, the question is about Americans in the throes of addiction right now struggling to get the treatment they need.
TRUMP: Because this does pertain to it. He ended remain in Mexico, he ended catch and release. I made the catch and release in Mexico, not catch and release here. We had so many things that we had done, hard negotiations with Mexico, and I got it all for nothing.
It's just like when you have a hostage, we always pay $6 billion for a – every time we sees hostage. Now we have a hostage. A Wall Street Journal reporter, I think a good guy, and he's over there because Putin is laughing at this guy, probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter.
I will have him out very quickly, as soon as I take office, before I take office. I said by literally as soon as I win the election, I will have that reporter out. He should have had him out a long time ago. But Putin is probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time.
We had two cases where we paid $6 billion for five people. I got 58 people out and I paid essentially nothing.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Trump.
Dana.
BASH: Let's turn to concerns that voters have about each of you.
President Biden, you would be 86 at the end of your second term. How do you address concerns about your capability to handle the toughest job in the world well into your 80s?
BIDEN: Well, first of all, I spent half my career being – being criticized being the youngest person in politics. I was the second-youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate. And now I'm the oldest. This guy's three years younger and a lot less competent. I think that just look at the record. Look what I've done. Look how I've turned around the horrible situation he left me.
As I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America, over millions – billions of dollars in private investment and – and enterprises that we are growing. We've – by the way, we brought an awful a lot of people – the whole idea of computer chips. We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented those chips. And we lost it because he was sending people to cheap – to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product.
So I went – I went to South Korea. I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States. And then guess what? Those fabs, they call them, to – to build these chips, those fabs pay over $100,000. You don't need a college degree for them. And there's billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans all over – from all over the world.
BASH: President Biden, you have 40 seconds left. Would you like to add anything?
BIDEN: Yeah, I would. The idea that somehow we are this failing country, I never heard a president talk like this before. We – we're the envy of the world. Name me a single major country president who wouldn't trade places with the United States of America. For all our problems and all our opportunities, we're the most progressive country in the world and getting things done. We're the strongest country in the world. We're country in the world who keeps our word and everybody trusts us, all of our allies.
And our – those who he cuddles up to, from Kim Jong-un who he sends love letters to, or Putin, et cetera, they don't want to screw around with us.
BASH: Thank you.
Former President Trump, to follow up, you would be 82 at the end of your second term. What do you say to voters who have concerns about your capabilities to serve?
TRUMP: Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests. I aced them, both of them, as you know. We made it public. He took none. I'd like to see him take one, just one, a real easy one. Like go through the first five questions, he couldn't do it. But I took two cognitive tests. I took physical exams every year. And, you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I'm in very good health. I just won two club championships, not even senior, to regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball along way. And I do it. He doesn't do it. He can't hit a ball 50 yards. He challenged me to a golf match. He can hit a ball 50 years.
I think I'm a very good shape. I feel that I'm in as good a shape as I was 25, 30 years ago. Actually, I'm probably a little bit lighter. But I'm in as good a shape as I was years ago. I feel very good. I feel the same.
But I took – I was willing to take a cognitive test. And you know what, if I didn't do well – I aced them. Dr. Ronny Jackson, who's great guy, when he was White House doctor. And then I took another one, a similar one, and both – one of them said they'd never seen anybody ace them.
BASH: Thank you.
President Biden?
BIDEN: You're going to see he's six-foot-five and only 225 pounds – or 235 pounds.
TRUMP: [inaudible].
BIDEN: Well, you said six-four, 200.
TRUMP: [inaudible].
BIDEN: Well, anyway, that's – anyway, just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is.
Look, I'd be happy to have a driving contest with him. I got my handicap, which, when I was vice president, down to a 6.
And by the way, I told you before I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it?
TRUMP: That's the biggest lie that he's a 6 handicap, of all.
BIDEN: I was 8 handicap.
TRUMP: Yeah.
BIDEN: Eight, but I have – you know how many…
TRUMP: I've seen your swing, I know your swing.
[crosstalk]
BASH: President Trump, we're going to…
[crosstalk]
TRUMP: Let's not act like children.
BIDEN: You are a child.
BASH: To you, a specific concern that voters have about you. Will you pledge tonight that once all legal challenges have been exhausted that you will accept the results of this election regardless of who wins and you will say right now that political violence in any form is unacceptable?
TRUMP: Well, I shouldn't have to say that, but, of course, I believe that. It's totally unacceptable.
And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time, and also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it's one of the strongest statements you've ever seen.
In addition to the speech I made, in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I've ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that. They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol. And in many cases were ushered in by the police.
And as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine. She said that loud and clear.
But the answer is, if the election is fair free, and I want that more than anybody.
And I'll tell you something – I wish he was a great president because I wouldn't be here right now. I'd be at one of my many places enjoying myself. I wouldn't be under indictment because I wouldn't have been his political appoint – you know, opponent. Because he indicted me because I was his opponent.
I wish he was a great president. I would rather have that.
I wouldn't be here. I don't mind being here, but the only reason I'm here is he's so bad as a president that I'm going to make America great again. We're going to make America great again.
We're a failing nation right now. We're a seriously failing nation. And we're a failing nation because of him.
His policies are so bad. His military policies are insane. They're insane.
These are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War Three and we're closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine. We are very, very close to World War Three, and he's driving us there.
And Kim Jong Un, and President Xi of China – Kim Jong Un of North Korea, all of these – Putin – they don't respect them. They don't fear him. They have nothing going with this gentleman and he's going to drive us into World War Three.
BIDEN: If you want a World War Three, let him follow (ph) and win, and let Putin say, do what you want to NATO – just do what you want.
There's a thing called Article Five, an attack on one is attack on all, a required response.
The idea – the idea – I can't think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn't trade place with what job I've done and what they've done because we are a powerful nation, we have wonderful piece (ph), because of the people, not me, because of the American people. They're capable of anything and they step up when they're needed.
And right now, we're needed. We're needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake.
And again, you want to have war, just let Putin go ahead and take Kyiv, make sure they move on, see what happens in Poland, Hungary, and other places along that border. Then you have a war.
BASH: President Trump, as I come back to you for a follow-up. The question was, will you accept the results of this election regardless of who wins?
TRUMP: Just to finish what he said, if I might, Russia – they took a lot of land from Bush. They took a lot of land from Obama and Biden. They took no land, nothing from Trump, nothing.
He knew not to do it. He's not going to play games with me. He knew that. I got along with him very well, but he knew not to play games.
He took nothing from me, but now, he's going to take the whole thing from this man right here.
That's a war that should have never started. It would've never started ever with me. And he's going to take Ukraine and, you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this with – he's got us in such a bad position right now with Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine's not winning that war.
He said, I will never settle until such time – they're running out of people, they're running out of soldiers, they've lost so many people. It's so sad.
They've lost so many people and they've lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are 1,000-years-old, all because of him and stupid decisions.
Russia would've never attacked if I were president.
BASH: President Trump, the question was, will you accept the results of the election regardless of who wins? Yes or no, please?
TRUMP: If it's a fair and legal and good election – absolutely. I would have much rather accepted these but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous that if you want, we'll have a news conference on it in a week or we'll have another one of these on – in a week.
But I will absolutely – there's nothing I'd rather do. It would be much easier for me to do that than I'm running again. I wasn't really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did. He's destroying our country.
I would be very happy to be someplace else, in a nice location someplace. And again, no indictments, no political opponent's stuff, because it's the only way he thinks he can win.
But unfortunately, it's driven up by numbers and driven it up to a very high level, because the people understand it.
BIDEN: Let's see what your numbers are when this election is over.
TRUMP: We'll see.
BIDEN: Let's see. You're a whiner. When you lost the first time, you continued to appeal and appeal to courts all across the country.
Not one single court in America said any of your claims had any merit, state or local, none.
But you continue to provoke this lie about somehow there's all this misrepresentation, all the stealing. There's no evidence of that at all.
And I tell you what? I doubt whether you'll accept it because you're such a whiner. The idea if you lose again, you're accepting anything, you can't stand the loss. Something snapped in you when you lost the last time.
BASH: We'll be right back with more from the CNN presidential debate live from Georgia.
[commercial break]
TAPPER: It is now time for the candidates to deliver their closing statements.
As predetermined by a coin toss, we're going to begin with you, President Biden. You have two minutes.
BIDEN: We've made significant progress from the debacle that was left by President Trump in his – in his last term.
We find ourselves in a situation where, number one, we have to make sure that we have a fair tax system. I ask anyone out there in the audience, or anyone out watching this debate, do you think the tax system is fair?
The fact is that I said, nobody even making under $400,000 had a single penny increasing their taxes and it will not. And if I'm reelected, that'll be the case again.
But this guy is – has increased your taxes because of the deficit. Number one, he's increased inflation because of the debacle he left after – when he handled the pandemic. And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10 percent tariff on everything comes into the United States America.
What I did, when, for example, he wants to get away with – and get rid of the ability of Medicare to – for the ability to – for the – us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies.
Well, guess what? We got it – we got it down to 15 – excuse me, $35 for insulin instead of $400. No more than $2,000 for every senior no matter what they – how much prescription they need.
You know what that did? That reduced the federal deficit (ph) – debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn't have to pay the exorbitant prices.
I'm going to make that available to every senior, all – or go longer. It's happening now, and everybody in America. He wants to get rid of that.
We have – I'm going to make sure we have childcare. We're going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare. I'm going to make sure we do something about what we're doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country.
We're going to continue to fight to bring down inflation and give people a break.
TAPPER: Thank you, President Biden.
President Trump, you now have two minutes for your closing statement.
TRUMP: Like so many politicians, this man is just a complainer. He said we want to do this. We want to do that. We want to get rid of this tax, that tax, but he doesn't do anything. He doesn't do.
All he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in. Our military doesn't respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan.
We didn't stop – Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened.
Iran was broke. Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn't do business with the United States. They all passed.
Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror, no money whatsoever.
Again, Ukraine should have never happened.
He talks about all this stuff, but he didn't do it. For three-and-a-half years, we're living in hell. We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place.
You talk about Charlottesville. This is 100 times Charlottesville, 1,000 times.
The whole country is exploding because of you, because they don't respect you. And they have to respect their president and they don't respect you throughout the world.
What we did was incredible. We re – rebuilt the military. We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history.
The reason he's got jobs is because I cut the regulations that gave jobs, but he's putting a lot of those regulations back on.
All of the things that we've done, nobody's ever – never seen anything like – even from a medical standpoint. Right to Try, where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you're terminally ill.
Now, you can go and you can get something. You signed a document. They've been trying to get it for 42 years.
But you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they're living. And that's why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A.
So, all of these things – we're in a failing nation, but it's not going to be failing anymore. We're going to make it great again.
BASH: Thank you, former President Trump, President Biden.	Presidential Debate in Atlanta, Georgia"
"Jun 28, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-rally-raleigh-north-carolina,"Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Raleigh, North Carolina","""The President. Hello, hello, hello.
Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe!
The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, North Carolina! And I'll get in trouble with my mom looking down in Heaven if I don't say please excuse my back, I apologize.
[At this point, the President addressed audience members standing behind the podium.]
[Inaudible] It's good knowing you—it's good knowing you have my back.
Eric, thank you for that introduction. We had a wonderful time spending time with your sons Christian and Carter. They're going to grow up to be incredible young men. You would have been really impressed the way they talked about their dad, how informed they were about what was going on. I was truly impressed. And I ate two hamburgers. [Laughter]
And a special thanks to Roy and Kristin Cooper. Roy, you've been a great Governor, which makes it all the more important that North Carolina elect a great Governor to replace you, Josh Stein.
And when I'm reelected again with your help, I want you to know that I'm not promising not to take Roy away from North Carolina. Whether he'll come or not, I don't know.
And thanks to all the State and local leaders here today and the great musicians and entertainers who performed earlier.
Folks, let me tell you why I'm here in North Carolina. I'm here for one——
Audience member. [Inaudible]—war in Gaza.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. That's okay.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. That's okay.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. I'm here in North Carolina for one reason: Because I intend to win this State in November, and we're going to see that. I think we are. And Roy is right. We win here, we win the election.
And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to stand up for the women of America. We're going to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. We're going to stand up for the right to vote. And we're going to stand up for Medicare and Social Security. And we're going to fight for childcare, paid leave, and eldercare.
And we're going to keep lowering the cost of prescription drugs, not just for seniors, but for every single American. We're going to keep protecting the Affordable Care Act, which is why more than 40 million Americans have health insurance today that didn't before.
We're going to protect our children and get the weapons of war off our streets. We're going to provide clean drinking water, affordable high-speed internet, quality education for every child in America. We're going to secure our border and protect legal immigration.
And unlike the other guy, we're going to stand up to dictators like Putin, because—America bows to no one—no one—no one ever.
Folks—and we're going to keep dealing with the climate crisis.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Look, and more than—and more than anything, we're going to preserve, protect, and defend our democracy. Because more than anything else, that is what is at stake in America this election—your freedom, your democracy. America itself is at stake.
Now, folks, I don't know what you did last night, but I spent 90 stages—90 minutes on a stage debating the guy who has the morals of an alley cat. [Laughter] Did you see Trump last night? My guess he set—and I mean this sincerely—a new record for the most lies told in a single debate.
He lied about the great economy he created. He lied about the pandemic he botched, killing millions of people. He closed businesses. He closed schools. Losing their homes—people all over this country.
America was flat on its back. So I told Trump that he was just one of two Presidents in American history who left office with fewer jobs than he started. Herbert Hoover was the other one. [Laughter] That's why I call him Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump.
And then he lied about how great he was for veterans.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. But then I told him how he had called a veteran who had given their lives in the country in World War I—he refused to go to the gravesites—he called them ""suckers"" and ""losers.""
Audience members. Boo!
The President. He tried to deny it. But let me ask you, are you going to believe a four-star Marine general, his own former Chief of Staff, John Kelly, who said he said that or the disgraced, defeated, and lying Donald Trump?
My son was one of those people—not in World War I, but in the——
Folks, look, how about the fact that 44——
Audience member. [Inaudible]
Audience members. Four more years! Four more year! Four more years!
The President. How about the fact——
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. That's okay.
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. How about the fact that 40 out of his 44 top advisers, including the Vice President, aren't supporting him this time around? The people who know him best—40 of them said, ""I will not support the man I worked for this time around."" It tells you a lot about—the person who knows him.
Look, he lied about how great he was on crime. I had to remind him that he oversaw a record increase of murder rates in 2020. And, on my watch, violent crime has hit a 50-year low. There's more to do, but it's a 50-year low.
And then, I pointed out that the only convicted criminal on the stage last night was Donald Trump.
When I've thought about his 34 felony convictions, his sexual assault on a woman in a public place, his being fined $400 million for business fraud, I thought to myself, ""Donald Trump isn't just a convicted felon. Donald Trump is a one-man crime wave."" And he's got more trials—he's got more trials coming up.
Audience members. Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
The President. Well, the time for that—[laughter].
Audience members. Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
The President. Look, the thing that bothers me maybe most about him: He has no respect for women or the law. He doesn't.
And then, his biggest lie. He lied about how he had nothing to do with the insurrection of January the 6th.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. We all saw with our own eyes. We watched it on television. We saw thousands of insurrectionists attack the Capitol. We saw police being attacked, the Capitol being ransacked, the mob hunting for Speaker Pelosi, gallows literally set up for Mike Pence. And then, he told them as he sat in the dining room—the one dining—the private dining one door off my Oval Office. He sat there for 3 hours watching the TV. He did not a single thing to stop it—nothing, nothing at all.
And now——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. And now, he wants to pardon all those convicted criminals.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. But, folks, for all his lies, we did learn some—we learned some important truths about Donald Trump last night. We learned he's still proud of being the person who killed Roe v. Wade.
We learned——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No. We learned he's still proud about the pain and cruelty he's inflicted on America's women.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. We learned he still believes that politicians, not doctors and women, should make decisions about a woman's health.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. We learned that if he's elected again and the MAGA Republicans pass a national ban on abortion, he will sign it.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Donald Trump says he thinks Roe v.—overturning Roe v. Wade was a beautiful thing.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. I think it was a nightmare. No, I really mean it. A nightmare.
And I made it clear again last night that if you elect me and Kamala and you give us a Democratic Congress, we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again.
He continued to lie. He said I quadrupled taxes—where the hell has he been?—[laughter]—which is a simple lie. I didn't raise the tax on anyone in America that made less than $400,000 a year, and I won't in my second term either.
We learned that Trump—who had the largest deficit of any President in 4 years because of the $2 trillion tax cut to the superwealthy—we learned that Trump wants to give another giant tax cut for the very wealthy and the biggest corporations. This time, $5 trillion—not a joke—$5 trillion. To pay for it, he's going to cut Medicare and Social Security. He'll cut health care. They'll do it all, with millions of working and middle class Americans all paying for another tax cut for the very wealthy.
Then, to add insult to injury, he wants to raise taxes on the average family $2,500 a year. What amounts to a new 10-percent sales tax on all products imported in America—that's his new plan—for food, coffee, candy bars, and so much more. It's going to raise the tax on the average family $2,500 a year.
And most dangerously, though, we learned that Donald Trump will not respect this year's election outcome. He's still not—he rejected the last time out.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No, think about it. Every court in the land ruled that it was a fair election. He's still denying it, still telling lies.
Three times, Trump was asked last night by the moderators: Would he respect the election results if he lost this time? Three times, he refused to answer. Three times.
Folks, Donald Trump refused to accept the results in 2020, and we all saw what happened on January the 6th. It's a direct consequence of that. It was an international embarrassment.
By the way, as I go these international meetings—I know every major world leader—I literally—because I've been around, as you might have noticed. [Laughter] But they ask, ""Does he really mean this?"" ""Is that—was this real?"" It caused a constitutional crisis and international embarrassment.
Now, Trump is making it clear that if he doesn't win this time, there will be, in his words, ""bloodshed""—blood——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No President has ever said anything like that. No President. His words, not mine.
Are we going to let Donald Trump attack our democracy again?
Audience members. No!
The President. I don't think so.
Folks——
Audience member. [Inaudible]
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Folks, we've come a long way. We've come a long way from the mess that Donald Trump left us. We came out of the pandemic. We're a long way from where—Donald Trump telling us to inject bleach in our skin, that COVID is not that dangerous.
Today, we have the strongest economy in the world without exception—15 million new jobs; 800,000 manufacturing jobs; unemployment under 4 percent for a record 2 years in a row—historic Black and Hispanic unemployment down; historic creation of small businesses—Black and all communities across the Nation, particularly in rural areas; historic economic growth; inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3, and it's still going down.
I know we have more to do to get prices down. We have to take on corporate greed. They're making twice the profit they were before the pandemic. We've got to make housing more affordable, provide childcare, make the Tax Code fair.
Sixteen Nobel winners of the economic—Nobel Prize have looked at my economy—economic plan. This week, they've issued a report. And on Trump's plan.
Here's what they concluded. They said that my plan would continue to grow the economy and bring down inflation. Sixteen Nobel laureates. And that Trump's plan would send the Nation into recession and inflation soaring through the roof.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. But don't take my word for it.
Folks, let me close with this. I know I'm not a young man—[laughter]—to state the obvious.
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. Well, I know.
Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe!
The President. Well—I don't——
Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe!
The President. Folks, I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth.
I know—I know—I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done. And I know like millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up.
I know what it took to take our economy from the depths of pandemic to where it is today: the strongest economy in the world. I know what it will take to bring this economy to everybody. I know what it will take to rally the world to stand up against Putin and defend freedom, not yield to him. And I know what it will take to keep the world safe and free for the years ahead.
Folks, I give you my word as a Biden. I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job. Because, quite frankly, the stakes are too high.
Audience members. Yes, you can! Yes, you can! Yes, you can!
The President. The stakes are too high.
Audience members. Yes, you can! Yes, you can! Yes, you can!
The President. Donald Trump—Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this Nation.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. He is a threat to our freedom.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. He is a threat to our democracy.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. He's literally a threat for everything America stands for.
Audience members. Yes!
The President. Look, he doesn't understand what I think all of you do. America is the finest, the most unique nation in the world.
We're the only nation in the world—and I mean this sincerely. It's a fact statement, not a hyperbolic statement. It's fact. We're the only nation in the world built on an idea. All other nations are built on ethnicity, geography, and other—religion. But we're built on an idea that we're all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.
We've never fully lived up, but I'll be damned in the year 2024, just 2 years—just 2 years before the 250th anniversary of our Declaration of Independence that I'll let Donald Trump walk away from it.
I give you my word—I give you my word as a Biden. We're still a nation—I believe our civilization believes in honesty, in decency, and treating people with respect. I still believe we're a nation that gives everyone a fair shot and leaves nobody behind.
We are still a nation that gives hate no safe harbor. And we're still the beacon to the world. We can never give up what makes America America.
Donald Trump is motivated by revenge and retribution. Well, revenge and retribution never built a damn thing.
You and I, we Americans are a nation of hope, optimism, and possibilities. That's what always built America, and that's going to continue to build America today.
The choice in this election is simple. Donald Trump will restore our democracy; I will defend it. [Applause] So, folks, are you with me?
Donald Trump is the first President I've heard of that stood up there and running for President having been one—one term, saying, ""America is a failing nation."" Where the hell does he think he is?
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No, I'm serious. A failing—I don't know a President who wouldn't trade places with America in a heartbeat. He's dead wrong. America is not a losing nation. America is winning.
As I stand here today, I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future in my whole career. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And there is—there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity—nothing—when we act together.
Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
The President. You've got it.
Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
The President. So may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Let's go get them, North Carolina.

"Jul 11, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1271,The President's News Conference,"""The President. Hey, everybody. Thank you. Please be seated.

Well, good evening. We just concluded this year's NATO summit. And the consensus among the members was it was a great success. It was especially momentous because it represented the 75th year of the most important military defense alliance in the world's—the history of the world.

We should never forget that NATO grew out of the wreckage of World War II, the most destructive war in history. The idea was to create an alliance of free and democratic nations that would commit themselves to a compact of collective defense. Standing together, they knew we'd all be safer. An attack on one would be treated as an attack on all.

And it's worked because a would-be aggressor knows if they attack one of us, they'll be attacked by all of us. Sending that message is the best way to deter aggression and prevent wars in the first place.

For those who thought NATO's time had passed, they got a rude awakening when Putin invaded Ukraine. Some of the oldest and deepest fears in Europe roared back to life because, once again, a murderous madman was on the march.

But this time, no one cowered in appeasement, especially the United States. We collected intelligence that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine months before the invasion. I directed the intelligence community to be—a significant amount of intelligence to be declassified so I could start building an international coalition to oppose the invasion.

Then, in February, some of you remember, I warned the world that the invasion was imminent. I rallied a coalition of 50 nations from Europe to Asia to help Ukraine defend itself.

My foreign policy—many foreign policy experts thought, as Putin amassed Russian forces just 100 miles north of Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine—but he thought—he, Putin, thought it was the mother home of Russia—the capital would fall in less than a week.

But the Ukrainian people, backed by a coalition I helped build, stopped them. Today, Kyiv still stands. And NATO stands stronger than it has ever been.

During the week of this summit, several head of states made it a point in their statements to thank the United States and to thank me personally for all that NATO has achieved. NATO is not only stronger, NATO is bigger because we led the charge to bring in Finland and Sweden into the alliance, and it makes a gigantic difference.

[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]

Excuse me.

Meanwhile, my predecessor has made it clear he has no commitment to NATO. He's made it clear that he would feel no obligation to honor article 5. He's already told Putin, and I quote, ""do whatever the hell you want."" In fact, the day after Putin invaded Ukraine, here's what he said: It was ""genius."" It was ""wonderful."" Some of you forgot that, but that's exactly what he said.

But I've made it clear, a strong NATO is essential to American security. And I believe the obligation of article 5 is sacred. And I would remind all Americans, article 5 was invoked only once in NATO's long history, and that was to defend America after 9/11.

I made it clear that I will not bow down to Putin. I will not walk away from Ukraine. I will keep NATO strong. And that's exactly what we did and exactly what we'll continue to do.

Now the future of American policy is up to the American people. This is much more than a political question. It's more than that. It's a national security issue.

Don't reduce this to the usual testament that people talk about it—the issues of being a political campaign. It's far too important. It's about the world we will live in for decades to come. Every American must ask herself or himself: Is the world safer with NATO? Are you safer? Is your family safer?

I believe the American people know the answer to all those questions is ""yes."" And I believe the American people understand that America is stronger—stronger—because of our alliances. I believe the American consensus from Truman to Reagan to me still holds today.

America cannot retreat from the world. It must lead the world. We are an indispensable nation, as Madeleine Albright wrote.

Now let me turn to three other key issues.

Just this morning we had a great economic report showing inflation is down. Overall, prices fell last month. Core inflation is the lowest it's been in 3 years. Prices are falling for cars, appliances, and airfare—airfares. Grocery prices have fallen since the start of the year.

We're going to keep working to take down corporate greed to bring those prices down further.

Meanwhile, Trump's calling for a 10-percent tariff on everything Americans buy, including food from overseas, vegetables, and other necessities. And economists tell us that that would cost the average American working family another $2,500 a year. It's a tax of $2,500 a year.

Second, our efforts to secure the border—our southern border is working. After Trump killed the bipartisan effort to secure the border—Republicans and Democrats had worked on—because he thought it would benefit me and make him a loser, Republicans walked away. So I took executive action last month.

As a consequence, working with Mexico, border encounters have gone down over 50 percent. The current level is lower today than when Trump left office.

Third, for months, the United States has been working to secure a cease-fire in Gaza, to bring the hostages home, to create a path for peace and stability in the Middle East.

Six weeks ago, I laid out a detailed plan in writing. It was endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, the G-7. That framework is now agreed on by both Israel and Hamas. So I sent my team to the region to hammer out the details.

These are difficult, complex issues. There are still gaps to close, but we're making progress, the trend is positive, and I'm determined to get this deal done and bring an end to this war, which should end now.

Let me conclude where I began. We're the United States of America. We are the indispensable nation. Our leadership matters. Our partnerships matter. This moment matters. We must rise to meet it.

With that, I'll take your questions. I've been given a list of people to call on here.

Reuters, Jeff Mason.

2024 Presidential Election

Q. Mr. President, your political future has hung over the NATO summit a little bit this week. Speaker Pelosi made a point of suggesting that your decision on whether to stay in the race was still open. George Clooney and a handful of lawmakers have called on you to step aside. Reuters is reporting tonight that UAW leadership is concerned about your ability to win.

The President. UAW just endorsed me. But go ahead.

Q. Thank you. My question for you is, how are you incorporating these developments into your decision to stay? And separately, what concerns do you have about Vice President Harris's ability to beat Donald Trump if she were at the top of the ticket?

The President. Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump [Harris; White House correction] to be Vice President did I think she was not qualified to be President. So let's start there. Number one.

The fact is that—the consideration is that I think I'm the most qualified person to run for President. I beat him once, and I will beat him again.

Secondly, the idea—I served in the Senate a long time. The idea that Senators and Congressmen running for office worry about the ticket is not unusual.

And I might add, there were at least five Presidents running or incumbent Presidents who had lower numbers than I have now later in the campaign. So there's a long way to go in this campaign.

And so I'm just going to keep moving. Keep moving and—because, look, I've got more work to do. We've got more work to finish. There's so much—we've made so much progress. Think about it.

Think about where we are economically relative to the rest of the world. Name me a world leader who wouldn't want to trade places with our economy. We've created over 800,000 manufacturing jobs, 1.5 million jobs—I mean, so things are moving.

We've got more to go. Working class people still have—need help. Corporate greed is still at large. There are—prices—the corporate profits have doubled since the pandemic. They're coming down.

And so I'm optimistic about where things are going.

The President's Verbal Slips/North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit 

Q. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about your—you mixed up Presidents Zelenskyy and Putin earlier today. The——

The President. [Laughter]

Q. And you now have sort of your key allies—including the British Prime Minister, the President of France, and the German Chancellor—having to step in and make excuses for you on that. Officials here are saying off the record that your decline has become noticeable. Hasn't this now, frankly, become damaging for America's standing in the world? Thank you.

The President. Did you see any damage to our standing in my leading this conference? Have you seen a more successful conference? What do you think?

And the move—the Putin piece, I was talking about Putin, and I said, ""And now""—at the very end, I said, ""Here""—I mean, ""Putin."" And I said: ""Oh, no. I'm sorry, Zelenskyy."" And then I added five other names.

Look, guys, the idea anybody suggests that we haven't had an incredibly successful conference—how many times did you hear in that conference—I know it sounds too self-serving—but other leaders, heads of state, in thanking me saying, ""The reason we're together is because of Biden, because Biden did the following.""

Look, folks, this is a—well, anyway. I thought it was the most successful conference I've attended in a long time. And find me a world leader who didn't think it was.

Next one. Sorry. Nancy Cordes, CBS.

National Economy/Tax Code Reform/Organized Labor 

Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned there are instances in history where Presidents have faced a challenge, but what makes this moment in history so unique is that it is not your enemies who are calling on you to reconsider your decision to stay in the race. It's your friends, supporters, people who think you've done a great job over the past 4 years.

Have you spent time thinking about what it would mean for your legacy, which you've worked decades to build, if you stay in the race despite the concerns that voters say they have, and you lose to someone who you yourself have argued is unfit to return to the Oval Office?

The President. Well, look, I'm not in this for my legacy, I'm in this to complete the job I started.

As you'll recall, understandably, many of you and many economists thought my initial initiatives that I put forward—""Can't do that. It's going to cause inflation. Things are going to skyrocket. The debt's going to go up.""

What are you hearing now from mainstream economists? Sixteen economic Nobel laureates said I've done a hell of a job, that under my plans so far and what's going to happen in the future if I'm reelected, that things are going to get much better. Our economy is growing.

I was determined when I got elected to stop the trickle-down economic theory that if the wealthy did very well, everybody else would do well. My dad was a well-read and decent guy. I don't remember much trickling down on his kitchen table.

Middle class people and working class people need help. And so what happened is, I decided to implement—was able to implement as President what I believed when I was a Senator. And that is that the way to build this economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. That way, we grow the economy, and the wealthy still do very well. They do fine.

And guess what? Find me an economist—a mainstream economist who said we haven't done well. What have we not done that isn't working right now? And so we've got more to do though. We've got to finish the job.

And by the way, I come from the corporate State of the world. Delaware has more corporations than and—you know, registered in Delaware than every other State in the Nation combined.

I'm not anticorporate. But corporate profits have doubled since the pandemic—doubled. It's time things get back in order a little bit. It's time—for example, if I'm reelected, we're going to make sure that rents are kept at 5-percent increase, corporate rents for apartments and the like and homes are limited to 5 percent.

We're going to make a lot of changes that I've been talking about, because we're going to continue to grow this economy.

And by the way, I know—remember how I got so roundly criticized for being so pro-union—not labor—union—union? Well, guess what? I've been the most pro-union labor President in history. Not a joke.

And guess what? We had the Treasury Department do a study. When unions do better, everybody does better. Everybody does better.

And we talk about how, for example—and when I went—remember when we talked about getting the computer chip industry back in the United States? Used to be 40 percent of the industry. We invented the chip. Forty percent of the industry was in the United States.

And former Presidents decided that the best way to do it is find the cheapest labor in the world, send the product over there, and import what the product was.

And so what did I do? I was told not to go over to Europe—I mean, to Asia—including Europe, but Asia. And I remember going to South Korea, convincing them to invest $20 billion in the United States to build computer chip factories. And I asked why, when they finally decided to do it. And the answer was: Because you have the safest economy in the world and you have the best workers in the world.

So the whole idea here is, we've invested—there's over $50 billion in investment in computer chip manufacturing just coming into being. None of you thought that would happen. None of you thought that would happen. But it's happening. It's happening.

And that's going to grow economies all through—and by the way, red States and blue States—matter of fact, there's as much in red States as in blue States. I've made no distinction.

So my generic point is that the idea that we can't continue to build and grow the economy, make it fairer—and like I said, from my standpoint, when the middle class does well, that's when the whole economy grows. The poor have a shot; the wealthy do well. But the wealthy got to start paying their taxes.

Vice President Kamala D. Harris 

Q. As a follow-up, sir, you mentioned that your Vice President, Kamala Harris, would be ready to serve on day one. Can you elaborate on that? What is it about her attributes and her accomplishments over the last 4 years that make her ready to serve on day one, if necessary?

The President. First of all, the way she's handled the issue of freedom of women's bodies—to have control over their bodies.

Secondly, her ability to handle almost any issue on the board. This was a hell of a prosecutor. She was a first-rate person in—and in the Senate, she was really good.

I wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be President from the very beginning. I made no bones about that. She is qualified to be President. That's why I picked her.

Felicia Schwartz, Financial Times.

The President's Schedule 

Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The Presidency is the most straining job in the world, and it's 24/7. How can you say you'll be up for that next year, in 2 years, in 4 years given the limits you've acknowledged that you have today?

The President. The limits I've acknowledged I have?

Q. There's been reporting that you've acknowledged that you need to go to bed earlier, end your evening around 8.

The President. That's not true. Look—[laughter]—what I said was: Instead of my every day starting at 7 and going to bed at midnight, it'd be smarter for me to pace myself a little more. And I said—for example, the 8, 7, 6 stuff—instead of starting a fundraiser at 9 o'clock, start at 8 o'clock. People get to go home by 10 o'clock. That's what I'm talking about.

I'm not talking about—and if you looked at my schedule since I've—since I made that stupid mistake of—in the campaign—in the debate, I mean, my schedule has been full bore. I've done—where's—and where's Trump been? Riding around in his golf cart, filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball?

I mean, look, he's done virtually nothing. And I have—I don't know how many—I've—don't hold me to it—roughly 20 major events, some of them with thousands of people showing up.

And so I just think it's better. I always have an inclination, whether I was playing sports or doing politics, just to keep going, not stop. I've just got to just pace myself a little more—pace myself.

And the next debate, I'm not going to be traveling into 15 time zones a week before. [Laughter] Anyway, that's what it was about. That's what it was about.

And by the way, even with that, I love my staff, but they add things. They add things all the time at the very end. I'm catching hell from my wife for that. Anyway.

I'm sorry. Zeke Miller, Associated Press.

Ukraine/Russia 

Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Two questions for you. First, on the NATO summit. President Zelenskyy, in your meeting with him, he pressed you to lift your limitations on the Ukrainian use of American weapons, saying that—in his public remarks afterwards, saying that Ukraine cannot win the war unless those limitations are lifted. Are you reconsidering your position on that?

And then, secondly, following up on Felicia's question there. Leaders of your own party have said that they are not worried about that debate, they're worried about the next bad night and the bad night after that. How can you reassure the American people that you are up to the task and that there won't be more bad nights at a debate stage or somewhere else?

The President. The first thing about Zelenskyy asking for the ability to strike deep into Russia: We have allowed Zelenskyy to use American weapons in the near term, in the near abroad, into Russia. Whether or not he has—we should be—he should be attacked—for example, should Zelenskyy—he's not, but if he had the capacity to strike Moscow, strike the Kremlin, would that make sense? It wouldn't.

The question is: What's the best use of the weaponry he has and the weaponry we're getting to him? I've gotten him more HIMAR—I got him more long-range capacity as well as defensive capacity.

And so our military is working—I'm following the advice of my commander in chief—my—of the—the Chief of Staff of the military as well as the Secretary of Defense and our intelligence people. And we're making a day-to-day basis on what they should and shouldn't go—how far they should go in. That's a logical thing to do.

Second question related to——

The President's Accomplishments 

Q. Bad nights—bad night, sir. How can you reassure the American people that you won't have more bad nights, whether they'd be on a debate stage or it's a matter of foreign policy?

The President. Well, I tell you what, the best way to assure them is the way I assure myself, and that is: Am I getting the job done? Am I getting the job done?

Can you name me somebody who's gotten more major pieces of legislation passed in 3½ years? I got—I created 2,000 jobs just last week. So, if I slow down and I can't get the job done, that's a sign that I shouldn't be doing it. But there's no indication of that yet. None.

Who do we got here? Marek [Walkuski], Polskie Radio.

Q. Thank you, Mr. President. How are you?

The President. I'm well.

2024 Presidential Election/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/U.S. Foreign Policy 

Q. The elections in the U.S. have consequences around the world. You have pretty high standing in Europe. I just asked President Macron about you, and he said, ""We are happy to have him as the President of the United States."" But there is a concern. Many people in Poland and across Europe are worried that the former President may win the election. And there's a lot of concern that Donald Trump may weaken NATO, stop supporting Ukraine, or push Ukraine to give up territories to Russia.

The President. They're correct.

Q. And your—yourself was warning just 2 minutes ago about it. So my question is: Do you think that Europe will be left on its own if Donald Trump wins the election? And what's your advice to European leaders to prepare for possible U.S. disengagement?

The President. Well, look, I think—how can I say this without sounding too self-serving? I'm not having any of my European allies come up to me and say, ""Joe, don't run."" What I hear them say is: ""You've got to win. You can't let this guy come forward. He'd be a disaster. He'd be a disaster.""

I mean, I think he said at one of his rallies—don't hold me to this—recently where NATO—""I just learned about NATO"" or something to that effect.

Foreign policy has never been his strong point. And he seems to have an affinity to people who are authoritarian. That worries—as I don't tell you, from Poland—that worries Europe. That worries Poland. And nobody, including the people of Poland, think that if he wins in Ukraine, he's going to stop in Ukraine, that that's going to be the end of it.

And so what I can say is, I think I am the best qualified person to do the job, to make sure that Ukraine is not fall—that Ukraine succeeds, that the European alliance stays strong.

You may recall, no one was talking about Finland joining NATO. I remember talking to Putin in—when—right after we got elected, in Geneva. And he was talking about what we should do—he—what we couldn't have—be in Eastern Europe, et cetera. And I said, ""You're looking for the Finlandization of Ukraine."" I said, ""You're going to get to NATOization of Finland.""

And about 4 weeks later, I got a call—that—that's not true—probably 5 months later—from the President of Finland, could he come and see me. Because—in my office, I had—I invited him to the Oval Office. We sat down and talked. He said he wanted to join NATO, could I help. And I did. It wasn't automatic.

And then I got a call from the Swedes.

[A laptop computer played audio.]

The President. I beg your pardon?

Q. It was a recording.

The President. And so Finland joined NATO. Eight-hundred-mile border, it's a significant—and they were already allies, but they weren't part of NATO.

And you heard—I think you heard—maybe—I can't recall if he said it publicly or in our—in a closed meeting, but he wouldn't mind it being repeated. He said, ""We decided in Finland—the people of Finland decided they had to be part of NATO. It was in our interest, because of the joint ability to be together, to dissuade any attack on Finland. And the same thing with Sweden. It took a lot of selling to some folks, particularly in Turkey and other places, to agree to the expansion.

But it expanded, and we're a hell of a lot stronger because of it. We're more secure because of it.

And by the way, I was able to get 50 other nations—50—five-zero—to support Ukraine. Fifty. And we were able to bring about a coalition between—in—of Europe and Asia—Japan and South Korea.

I just met with—we've talked about AUKUS, and we talked about the relationship between Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, the United States. We're making the world safer and stronger, because we have to deal with a new arrangement that exists in the world.

The cold war is over. The postwar era is over. What is going to replace it? And I respectfully suggest, I have a pretty good idea of what that should be. I've convinced a lot of people to follow it, and we're just going to get stronger.

David Sanger [New York Times]. Where is——

Q. Thank you, Mr. President.

The President. Be nice, David. [Laughter]

China/Russia/North Korea 

Q. Mr. President, the NATO declaration that was issued yesterday had—was very notable because it described China as a ""decisive enabler"" of the war in Ukraine and—for its provision of critical goods to the Russians. That's part of a broader partnership that seems to have cemented in place in the past 2 or 3 years. I think one that you were a little bit doubtful of when we asked you about it some time ago.

So I'd be interested to know whether you have a strategy now of trying to interrupt the partnership between China and Russia, and whether or not in a second term you would pursue that, if you could describe that strategy to us.

And along the way, could you also tell us whether you think—just to follow up on Felicia's question—that if you were in a room with Vladimir Putin, again, the way you were 3 years ago, or with President Xi, that a few years from now, you will be able to go negotiate with them, handle them one on one?

The President. Well, the first part of your question is, we discussed and I raised in the NATO summit—and others raised—the future of China's involvement, what they're going to do—what they're doing with Russia, in terms of accommodating, facilitating. They're getting access to additional—they're not supplying—they're not supplying weapons themselves; they're supplying mechanisms for them to be able to get weapons.

And China's position is basically—and I've spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader has—over 90 hours since being Vice President and all the way through. For real. And by the way, I handed in all my notes.

But my point is that Xi believes that China is a large enough market that they can entice any country, including European countries, to invest there in return for commitments to—from Europe to do A, B, C, or D, or not to do certain things.

What's happened is, we had a long discussion about what we cannot—we have to make clear, China has to understand that if they are supplying Russia with information and capacity, along with working with North Korea and others to help Russia in armament, that they're not going to benefit economically as a consequence of that—by getting the kind of investment they're looking for.

And so, for example, we're in a situation where when—and we've reestablished direct contact with China after that—remember the ""balloon,"" quote, unquote, going down and, all of a sudden, the thing came to an end? Well, we set up a new mechanism. There's a direct line between Xi and me, and our military has direct access to one another, and they contact one another when we have problems.

The issue is that we have to make sure that Xi understands there's a price to pay for undercutting both the Pacific Basin, as well as Europe, and as relates to Russia and dealing with Ukraine.

And so we—for example, if you want to invest in China, as you know—you know this area really well. If you want to invest in China, you have to—you have a 51-percent Chinese owner; you have to make sure that you do it by their rules; and you can't—you don't have the authority—and you have to provide all access to all the data and information you have.

There was a while there, as you recall, in the last administration and other administrations, where the access to that market was enticive [enticing; White House correction] enough to get companies to come in because they had access to over a billion people in the market—a market—not a billion, but a lot of people in the market. And so they were doing it.

But that curtailed—that got curtailed when we started saying we're going to play by the same rules. For example, the idea they don't abide by the international rules related to subsidizing products by the Government funding. So guess what? They're not going to be able to export their electric vehicles to the United States without a significant tariff. Others are doing the same thing around the world.

But it is a concern. It is a concern that you have both China, South Korea—I mean, North Korea, Russia, Iran—countries that are not necessarily coordinated in the past—looking to figure out how they can have impact.

China/European Defense Industrial Base/Russia 

Q. Do you have a strategy to interrupt that impact? To——

The President. Yes, I do, but I'm not prepared to talk about the detail of it in public.

And I think you'll see that some of our European friends are going to be curtailing their involve—investment in Russia—I mean, in—excuse me, in China, as long as China continues to have this indirect help to Russia, in terms of being able to help their economy as well as—as well as—help them in—as a consequence that their ability to fight in Ukraine.

The other thing that we talked a lot about is that—and I raised it, and there was—I didn't hear any—I can't swear that everyone agreed, because not everybody got to talk about it. But we haven't—we need a new industrial policy in the West. For example, we talked about how both the EU, as well as NATO, has to be able to begin to build their own munition capacity, has to be able to generate their own capacity to provide for weapons and the ability to—it came as a surprise to some of us how we had fallen behind in the West in terms of the ability to construct new materiel, new weaponry, and new—everything from vehicles to weapon systems.

And so one of the things that came out of this was—we're going to be meeting again with a number of my colleagues—my European colleagues—is: What do we do to increase the capacity of the West, and particularly in Europe, and Japan to be able to generate the kind of ability to produce their own weapons systems—not just for themselves, but to be able to generate that?

It's the same—this is—that's what Russia is trying to figure out. They went to China, and they didn't get the weapons, but then they went to North Korea.

But we're going to be in a position where the West is going to become the industrial base for it to be able to build—the ability to have all the defensive weapons that we need. That was a discussion as well.

China/Russia 

Q. Mr. President, I'm not sure you answered on whether you would be ready to go deal with Putin and Xi 2 or 3 years from now.

The President. I'm ready to deal with them now and 3 years from now. Look, the—like I said, I'm dealing with Xi right now, in direct contact with him. I have no good reason to talk to Putin right now. There's not much that he is prepared to do in terms of accommodating any change in his behavior.

And—but there isn't any world leader I'm not prepared to deal with. But I understand the generic point is: Is Putin ready to talk? I'm not ready to talk to Putin unless Putin is ready to change his behavior.

And the idea—look, Putin has got a problem. First of all, in this war that he has—supposedly had won—and by the way, I think—don't hold me to the exact number, but I think that Russia had 17.3 percent of Ukraine that they've conquered. Now it's 17.4—I mean, in terms of percentage of territory.

They've not been very successful. They've called horrible damage and loss of life. But they've also lost over 350,000 troops, military—killed or wounded. They have over a million people, particularly young people with technical capability, leaving Russia because they see no future there. They've got a problem.

But what they do have control of is, they are very good at controlling and running the public outcry that relates to how they use mechanisms to communicate with people. They lie like hell to their constituencies. They lie like hell about what's going on.

And so the idea that we're going to be able to fundamentally change Russia in the near term is not likely. But one thing for certain: If we allow Russia to succeed in Ukraine, they're not stopping at Ukraine.

I recommend—I know you know this because you've written about it—read Putin's speech after they moved in. What it was all about—in Kyiv—it wasn't about just—anyway, read what his objective is.

And anyway, but—so I think that I'm prepared to talk to any leader who wants to talk, including if Putin called me and he wanted to talk. Last time I talked to Putin was trying to get him to work on an arms control agreement related to nuclear weapons in space. That didn't go very far.

So my point is, I'm prepared to talk to anybody, but I don't see any inclination. There is an inclination on the part of the Chinese to keep in contact with me, because they're not sure where this all goes.

And look what's happened in Asia. We have strengthened the Asian-Pacific area more than anyone else has. We—you know, we just put together with—today, we had—we—I brought on—I asked the—our NATO allies that we bring on the group from the South Pacific: Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Australia—I already mentioned Australia.

And I met twice now, I think, with the 14 leaders of the Pacific Island nations, and we've slowed down what's going on there. We've slowed down China's reach.

But there's a lot of work to do. This is a moving target. And I don't take it lightly.

Asam [Asma; White House correction] from NPR.

Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Asma Khalid with NPR. I have two questions. Earlier, you spoke about the cease-fire plan between Israel and Hamas. We're now looking at 10 months of war. And I'm curious if there's anything that you feel personally you wish you would have done differently over the course of the war.

And then, secondly, if I may, I wanted to ask you about your Presidential campaign. I remember covering your campaign in 2020, and there was a moment where you referred to yourself as a quote, ""bridge"" candidacy, a transition to a younger generation of leaders. I want to understand what changed.

Israel/Gaza Conflict/Afghanistan/U.S. Diplomatic Efforts 

The President. Two things. Let's go back to when you talked about would I have changed anything that's happening with Israel and the Palestinians and the Palestinian movement.

The answer is, as you recall, from the very beginning, I immediately—I went to Israel, but I also got in immediate contact Elsisi in Egypt. I met with the King of Jordan. I met with—I met with most of the Arab leaders to try to get a consensus going as to what had to be done to deal with getting more aid and food and medicine into the Gaza Strip.

And we pushed it really hard. And Israel occasionally was less than cooperative. Number one.

The Israeli war cabinet I've been—I've been dealing with Israel since Golda Meir. I've—some—some of the reporters around here who cover me all the time have heard me say this: The last—first time I met with Golda Meir, I sat near—across from her and her desk, and her assistant was Rabin, sitting next to me. That's how far back I go.

I know Israel well, and I support Israel. But this war cabinet is one of the most conservative war cabinets in the history of Israel. And there's no ultimate answer other than a two-state solution here.

And so what was able to be done in terms of the organization—the plan I put together was, it would be a process for a two-state solution. And we get the Arab nations to—particularly from Egypt all the way to Saudi Arabia to be in a position where they would cooperate in the transition so that they could keep the peace in Gaza without Israeli forces staying in Gaza.

The question has been from the beginning: What's the day after in Gaza? And the day after in Gaza has to be—the end of the day after it has to be no occupation by Israel on the Gaza Strip, as well as the ability for us to access—get in and out, as rapidly as you can, all that's needed there.

I've been disappointed that some of the things that I've put forward have not succeeded as well, like the port we attached from Cyprus. I was hopeful that would be more successful.

But that's why I'm—when I went to Israel after—immediately after the massacres that occurred at the hands of Hamas, that I—the one thing I said to the Israelis, and I met with the war cabinet and with Bibi: Don't make the same mistake America made after bin Laden. There's no need to occupy anywhere. Go after the people who did the job.

You may recall, I get—still get criticized for it, but I was totally opposed to the occupation and trying to unite Afghanistan. Once we got—once we got bin Laden, we should have moved on because it was not in our—no one is ever going to unite it—unite that country.

I've been over every inch of that—not every inch—of the entirety, from the poppy fields, all the way to the north. I said: ""Don't make the same mistake we made. Don't think that's what you should be doing is doubling down. We'll help you find the bad guys, Sinwar and company.""

And I—and all this criticism about I wouldn't provide—when the weapons they needed. I am not providing them 2,000-pound bombs. They cannot be used in Gaza or any populated area without causing great human tragedy and damage.

But we're—remember what happened when you had the attack on Israel from—with rockets and ballistic missiles? I was able to unite the Arab nations as well as—as well as Europe, and nothing happened. Nothing got hurt. It sent—it sent an incredible lesson to what was going on from the Middle East.

So there's a lot of things that, in retrospect, I wish I had been able to convince the Israelis to do. But the bottom line is, we have a chance now. It's time to end this war. It doesn't mean walk away from going after Sinwar and Hamas.

And if you notice—you know better than most—there is a lot—a growing dissatisfaction in the—on the West Bank, from the Palestinians about Hamas. Hamas is not popular now.

And so there's a lot of moving parts. I just have to keep making—moving to make sure that we get as much done as we can toward a cease-fire—a cease-fire—and get those—and by the way, look at the numbers in Israel. I mean, I—my numbers are better in Israel than they are here. But, then again, they're better than a lot of other people here too.

But anyway——

The President's Accomplishments 

Q. If I may, Mr. President, a question about ""bridge"" candidacy. In 2020, you referred to yourself as being a ""bridge"" candidate for a younger, fresher generation of Democratic leaders. And I wanted to know, what changed?

The President. What changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited in terms of the economy, our foreign policy, and domestic division.

And I think—I won't put words in anybody's mouth. Most Presidential historians give me credit for having accomplished more than most any President since Johnson and maybe before that to get major pieces of legislation passed.

And what I realized was, my long time in the Senate had equipped me to have the wisdom to know how to deal with the Congress to get things done. We got more major legislation passed that no one thought would happen.

And I want to finish it—to get that finished. If tomorrow—if you said—if we had a circumstance wherever—there was a lineup, and I didn't—hadn't inherited what I did and we just moved things along—anyway, it's going to change.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Last question.

The President. Haley Bull, Scripps—or, no. Josh Wingrove [Bloomberg]—I'm sorry. It was the next one. I'll do two more questions then.

2024 Presidential Election 

Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Many of your colleagues, Democrats on the Hill are watching tonight as they assess what they want to say about your candidacy. I'm wondering how you're thinking of this right now. It seems like your answer is clear. But they're watching how things go tonight, tomorrow in Michigan, next week in Texas and Nevada. Are you thinking that way, about whether how the next week or two goes would inform your——

The President. Am I using it that way, you said?

Q. Are you thinking that way about how the next 2 weeks go? Will that affect your decision, or are you fully determined on running in November as the party's nominee?

The President. I'm determined on running, but I think it's important that I relay—I allay fears by seeing—let them see me out there. Let me see them out—you know, for the longest time it was, you know: ""Biden is not prepared to sit with us unscripted. Biden is not prepared to""—you know, anyway.

And so what I'm doing, and it's what I've been doing—I think we've done over 20 major events, from Wisconsin to North Carolina to—anyway—to demonstrate that I'm going out in the areas where we think we can win, where we can persuade people to move our way or people are already there.

And here, look, the other thing is, we have the most extensive campaign organization that anybody has had in a long, long time. We have well over a thousand volunteers knocking on doors, making phone calls, making tens of thousands of phone calls. We have headquarters—I forget exactly how many. I don't want to cite a number and then find out I'm off. But we have scores of headquarters in all the toss-up States. We're organized. We're moving.

And I—that's awful hard to replace in the near term.

And so—and here's the other thing: I was in the Senate a long time. Very proud of what I've done in the Senate. I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for a long time, and I was chairman of—or ranking member and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I'm going to be going down to the Johnson Library on—anyway, I'm going to be going around making the case of things that I think we have to finish and how we can't afford to lose what we've done or backslide on civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights. The—that little button we have: ""Control guns, not girls.""

I mean, the idea that we're seeing around—this is where Kamala is so good as well—we're sitting around—more children are killed with a—by a bullet than any other cause of death. The United States of America. What the hell are we doing? What are we doing? We've got a candidate saying—promised the NRA: ""Don't worry. I'm not going to do anything. I'm not going to do anything."" We've got a Supreme Court that is—what you might call the most conservative Court in American history.

This is ridiculous. There's so much we can do still, and I'm determined to get it done. It's about freedom.

And by the way—I'll end this—well, I—well, I'm going—not going to do that. Haley has to come up too.

But the—I remember I made a speech on democracy in Philadelphia, in Independence Hall. And—I'm not being critical, just observing—the bulk of the press said, ""What the hell is he talking about that for?"" Democracy—yes, you did. ""Democracy is not an issue."" ""Democracy is not an issue.""

Except the polling data showed 60 percent of the people knew I was right, thought I was right.

I'm not asking you a question; you don't have to answer, obviously. But do you think our democracy is under siege based on this Court? Do you think democracy is under siege based on Project 2025?

Do you think he means what he says when he says he's going to do away with the civil service, eliminate the Department of Education, make sure—I mean, there's—we've never been here before.

And that's the other reason why I didn't, as you say, hand off to another generation. I've got to finish this job. I've got to finish this job, because there's so much at stake.

Q. Very quickly. You had some discussions over the past few days with your Press Secretary about the question of health exams, and you said you take a cognitive test every day in this job. Are you open to taking another physical or tests before the election? Governor Whitmer of Michigan, for instance, said ""it wouldn't hurt"" to take a test.

The President's Cognitive Health 

The President. Well, look, two things. One, I've taken three significant and intense neurological exams by the neurologic—by a neurosurgeon—a neurologist. In each case—as recently as February, and they say I'm in good shape. Okay?

Although I do have a little problem with my left foot because it's not as sensitive, because I broke my foot and didn't wear the boot. But I'm good.

I'm tested every single day about my neurological capacity—the decisions I make every day.

You've talked to my staff. All of you talked to my staff. Sometimes, my staff talks a lot. [Laughter] But the fact of the matter is, I don't think you have them telling you that all the major ideas we've undertaken haven't been in part initiated by me.

I remember when the staff—and I said, ""I'm going to go to South Korea, and we're going to get the chip."" And: ""What are you doing?"" ""I'm going to get Japan and Korea back together again after no—essentially having hostilities toward one another since the end of World War II. I'm going to move and see that we can expand""—you know, the only thing age does is help you with a—it creates a little bit of wisdom if you pay attention.

And so the point I'm making is, I think it's important that I—if my—if the neurologist tells me he thinks I need another exam—and by the way, I've laid every bit of the record out. I haven't done—hadn't hidden—hadn't hidden—hidden a thing.

You ought to ask Trump for his, okay?

I've—I've laid it all out.

And every single day, I'm surrounded by good docs. If they think there's a problem, I promise you—or even if they don't think it's a problem—they think I should have a neurological exam again, I'll do it. But no one is suggesting that to me now.

And I'll ask you another question. No matter what I did, no one is going to be satisfied. ""Did you have seven docs? Did you have two? Who did you have? Did you do this? How many times have you""—so I am not opposed. If my doctors tell me they should—I should have another neurological exam, I'll do it. But that's where I am.

Haley Bull, Scripps.

2024 Presidential Election 

Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said you're making decisions on a day-to-day basis when it comes to support for Ukraine. Does that mean you have not closed the door on further considering lifting restrictions for U.S.-made weapons inside Russia?

And if I may, your convention is coming up where your delegates are pledged to make you the official nominee. If they have second thoughts, are they free to vote their conscience?

The President. Obviously, they're free to do whatever they want, but they—I get overwhelming support. Overwhelming support. I won how—I forget how many votes I won in the primary. The overwhelming—and so tomorrow, if all of a sudden, I show up at a convention and everybody says, ""We want somebody else,"" that's the democratic process. It's not going to happen.

Q. Even if that means they vote for someone else?

The President. Sure.

Look, I'll end this with this. I served in the Senate a long time. I understand the impetus of candidates running for local office and whether they think the top—if they can help them or not.

In my State of Delaware, which was a very—at least a purple—it was a red State when I started, in terms of where you now talk ""red"" and ""blue.""

I don't recall most of the Democratic Presidents winning my State when I was a candidate. The truth of the matter is I understand the self-interest of any candidate. If they think that, you know, running with Biden at the top of the ticket is going to hurt them, then they're going to run away. I get it.

But, so far, go and look at the polling data in their States. Look at the in depth—and by the way, I think you'd all acknowledge—and you're all experts; I'm not being solicitous about the press, you're experts on this stuff—how accurate does anybody think the polls are these days? I can give you a series of polls where you have likely voters, me versus Trump, where I win all the time. When the unlikely voters vote, he wins sometimes.

So, bottom line is, all the polling data right now, which I think is premature, because the campaign really hasn't even started. I mean, it hasn't started in earnest yet. Most of the time, it doesn't start until after September—after Labor Day. So a lot can happen.

But I think I'm the best qualified—I know—I believe I'm the best qualified to govern. And I think I'm the best qualified to win. But there are other people who could beat Trump too. But it's awful to start from scratch.

And you know, we talk about, you know, money raised. We're not doing bad. We've got about $220 million in the bank. And we're doing well.

So, with that, you have any—want to follow up on any of that you just asked me?

Q. Yes. [Laughter] You earlier explained confidence in your Vice President.

The President. Yes.

2024 Presidential Election

Q. If your team came back and showed you data that she would fare better against former President Donald Trump, would you reconsider your decision to stay in the race?

The President. No, unless they came back and said, ""There's no way you can win."" Me. No one is saying that. No poll says that.

Q. Mr. President—[inaudible].

The President. Okay. Thank——

[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]

Press Secretary Jean-Pierre. This ends tonight's press conference. Thanks everybody.

[Several reporters asked questions at once.]

This ends—this concludes——

Q. Sir, respectfully, earlier you misspoke in your opening answer. You referred to Vice President Harris as ""Vice President Trump."" Right now Donald Trump is using that to mock your age and your memory. How do you combat that criticism from tonight?

The President. Listen to him. Thank you.

Q. President Biden——

Press Secretary Jean-Pierre. This concludes tonight's press conference. Thank you, everybody. Thanks, everyone.""	The President's News Conference"
"Jul 12, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-campaign-rally-detroit-michigan,"Remarks at a Campaign Rally in Detroit, Michigan","""The President. Hello, hello, hello. Well, I tell you what——
Audience member. We love you!
The President. Well, thank you. I love you back.
Look, I wanted to—I'm not going home unless we get one sign, and that is, ""Motown is Joetown."" [Applause] And it is.
You don't know how true that is. My dad sold automobiles—got me through high school and college and law school—and selling automobiles and everything. We always looked to Motown. UAW! [Applause]
By the way, Pastor Rudolph—you just heard her. She's the AME Church. When I was a—and you know, I'm still a young guy. But I was a young fella—[laughter]—involved in the civil rights movement in my State, which was segregated by law, I'd always start at Pastor Beaman—now Bishop Beaman's Church, the AME Church in Wilmington. For real. I'd go to 7:30 Mass, and then I'd go to 10 o'clock service, because we'd plan what we were going to do, how to desegregate the restaurants and the streets of our city. And I tell you what, now you know why I spent so much time in the AME church. [Laughter]
Pastor, thanks for that introduction and for your spiritual leadership in the community.
And by the way, we got a great crowd here tonight, to state the obvious. But my—if I didn't do this, I'd get in trouble, with my dad looking down on me.
[At this point, the President turned around to address audience members positioned behind him.]
Audience member. We love you!
The President. My dad—[applause]. My dad would give me hell if I didn't turn and say, ""Excuse my back. I apologize."" [Laughter]
Look, folks——
Audience member. We've got your back!
The President. ——Members of Congress, Debbie—Debbie——
Audience members. We've got your back! We've got your back! We've got your back!
The President. I've got your back.
Audience members. We've got your back! We've got your back! We've got your back!
The President. And I've got—I've got your back as well.
Members of Congress, Debbie, Haley, and—[inaudible]. By the way, I want you know that I've spent a lot of time with Debbie. She's helped me, like, a lot. And last—we were—I forget which event we were at. And someone said, ""You're his wife, aren't you?"" [Laughter] Because she looks like Jill, my wife.
And, Shri, thank you very much. I want—I can't tell you—look, we've got State leaders: the Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist, who is here somewhere. He's hard to miss; he's 7-foot-3. Secretary of State Benson. Lavora Barnes, Democratic chairman—[chair; White House correction].
We've got civil right leaders, faith leaders, labor leaders, including SEIU, CWA, AFL-CIO. Thank you all. And by the way, I don't call it ""labor."" It's simple: unions. I say the word.
I can't tell you how much this means to me. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And, folks, look, I'm here for one reason: Kamala and I won Michigan in 2020 because of you, and we're going to win it again in 2024.
And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to stand up for women in America. We're going to protect contraception. We're going to protect IVF, and we're going to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. I mean it.
We're going to protect the right to vote. And we're going to fight for Medicare and Social Security, not cut it like the other guy wants to do.
And I'm going to—I promise you I'm going to keep lowering the cost of prescription drugs in America. We're going to keep expanding health care.
No matter how many times Trump and his MAGA Republicans come after the Affordable Care Act, we will stop them and stop them and stop them. I mean it. Too many people are depending on it.
We're going to protect our children. We're going to get weapons of war off the street. We're going to ban assault weapons. Folks, look, more children are killed by the—a bullet than any other reason in America. They die for that—from more than anything else, any disease, any problem. It's sick.
And, above all else, we're going to stand up for our Constitution and save our democracy.
Folks, you probably noticed, there's been a lot of speculation lately: ""What's Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out?"" Well, here's what I say: I am running, and we're going to win. I'm not going to change that.
In fact, just today, the Marist Poll released a national poll that has me beating Trump 50 to 48.
I don't know where all this drop-off supposedly took place. There's so much of my narrative—my campaign is falling apart, they say.
I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party, the only Democrat or Republican who has beaten Donald Trump ever. And I'm going to beat him again.
I know him. Donald Trump is a loser.
Audience members. Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
The President. Well, folks—folks, I'm the nominee. I'm the nominee of this party because 14 million Democrats like you voted for me in the primaries. You made me the nominee, no one else—not the press, not the pundits, not the insiders, not donors. You, the voters—you decided. No one else. And I'm not going anywhere.
I learned a long time ago that when you get knocked down, you get back up. I've led this Nation from the depths of the pandemic to the strongest economy literally in the world. And we're not done yet. We're not done yet. We have to finish the job and do what I'm—[inaudible]—that's how we're going to do. [Laughter]
Folks, let me tell you something about Donald Trump and his friends down in Mar-a-Lago.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Wall Street didn't build this country. You did. The working people and the middle class built this country. And unions built the middle class. That's a fact. [Applause] That's a fact.
Folks, I'm proud to say I'm the first and only President in American history to walk a picket line. Because I know labor—when labor does well, everybody does well. That's not hyperbole.
I came to Michigan to walk that picket line. I stood shoulder to shoulder with United Auto Workers, the greatest autoworkers in the world. And I want you to know, I promise you—I give you my word as a Biden—I will always have your back and—because you've always had mine.
Remember what Donald Trump did when I was here walking the picket line? He gave a speech at a nonunion shop.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. So, when Trump comes here to tell you how great he is for the auto industry, remember this: When Trump was President, we lost 86,000 jobs in union. And I created 275,000 auto jobs in America.
In fact, what's been true in the auto industry is true all over America. Since I became President, we've created nearly 16 million new jobs nationwide, 390,000 of those jobs right here in Michigan. We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide, including 24,000 in Michigan.
Unemployment is down to 4 percent, and record lows for more than 2 years. Historic-low unemployment for Hispanics, Black, Asian American, including here in Michigan.
Look, just yesterday it was reported, because of my economic plan, inflation is down again—again. Overall prices fell last month. Core inflation is the lowest it's been in 3 years. Prices are falling for cars, appliances, airfares. Grocery prices have fallen since the start of this year.
We've got more to do. We're going to keep working to take corporate greed—take it on.
You know, since the pandemic, corporations have doubled their profits. I understand corporations. I come from the corporate capital of the world: Delaware. They have more corporations incorporated in my State than every other State in the Union combined. I'm not anticorporation, but I'm antigreed. That's what I'm anti.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump—other than riding around in his golf cart, filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball—[laughter]—he's calling for—I'm serious, he's calling for—this is the God's truth—he's calling for a 10-percent tariff on everything we import, including fruits, vegetables, coffee, and other necessities.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. And the leading economists in this country tell us that his plan would cost working families $2,500 a year in a new tax. That—no, that's a fact. Not a joke.
Folks, the vast majority agree, our economy is moving in the right direction. Jobs are up, wages are up, the economy continues to grow, and inflation is down.
And I love telling Trump this, even though I don't own any stock: The stock market is a historic high. It closed at over 40,000, Donald.
People are getting a little worried that so many moderate and mainstream Republican—well, they're not all Republican—mainstream economists support me. Look, there are more people that have more money in their 401(k)s than they ever did before.
But, folks, you don't have to take my word for it. Sixteen Nobel laureates in economics agree: Under my economic plan, you know, they say we're going to continue to grow and keep inflation down. They say that Trump's plan would make—put the economy in a recession. Because when—16 Nobel laureates last week say he would put us in recession and inflation would soar.
Folks, look, in fact, I should—I guess I should worry, but the new Wall Street Journal survey of economists says inflation would be worse under Trump. That's the Wall Street Journal. Great paper. Usually not supportive of me. [Laughter]
Do you really want to go back to the chaos of Donald Trump as President——
Audience members. No!
The President. ——back when the United States lost 3 million jobs?
Audience members. No!
The President. And by the way—by the way, Donald Trump is the only President in American history other than Herbert Hoover who lost more jobs than he had when he came in. That's why I call him Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump.
Remember the days when people were dying—literally dying—and we were pushing on the COVID effort? Well, guess what? He told us: ""You don't worry about the COVID. It's not that bad. Just in bleach—just inject some""—really—""inject bleach in your arm."" I think he missed; he hit his head. [Laughter]
Look, remember when Trump was transgressing peaceful protests across the White House lawn who were marching for justice.
Look, folks, it just—it's—you know, if it wasn't so serious, it would all—almost be like a made-up novel, what happened.
Now, I'm not complaining; I'm just saying. You may have noticed that since the debate, the press—and they're good guys and women up there—they've been hammering me. I make a lot of mistakes.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No, no, I——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No, no, no. It's okay. It's—they've been hammering me because I sometimes confuse names. I say that's Charlie instead of Bill.
But guess what? Donald Trump has gotten a free pass. He hadn't done a damn thing until, like, a couple of days ago. He'd been riding around on his golf course—golf cart in his course, filling out his scorecard before he picks up his club. [Laughter]
Rambling about—think of what he sees—been talking about. Hannibal Lecter, he says, is a nice guy. [Laughter] How Trump would rather be electrocuted than eaten by shark. You know, that whole thing? You remember that?
Poor Donald. He can't even watch TV this week because it's ""Shark Week."" [Laughter]
And by the way, on a more serious note, I had 32 members of the—and from—mostly from Europe, but 32 members of NATO in Washington. And by the way—and the press has covered this. They give me credit for strengthening NATO, expanding NATO, making it what it is.
But look, this is deadly earnest. When that butcher, Putin, who I know and have known for a long time——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. When he invaded Ukraine, here's what Trump said—I'm not making this up either. He called him a ""genius"" and said it was ""wonderful.""
Audience members. Boo!
The President. What in the hell is going on?
But people would rather talk about how I mix up names. I guess they don't remember that Trump called Nikki Haley ""Nancy Pelosi."" [Laughter]
Well, no—no more. Donald, no more free passes. Today we're going to shine a spotlight on Donald Trump. We're going to do what the press, so far, hasn't, but I think they're going to soon. We're going to say who he is, what he intends to do.
Folks, Donald Trump is a—Donald Trump is a convicted criminal. He is convicted.
Audience members. Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
The President. He was convicted by—he was convicted by a jury of his peers of 34 felonies for paying hush money to a porn star and hiding it from voters in 2016.
Donald Trump was found liable for sexual assault by a judge who told us not to be fooled by Trump's brushing it off. Here is what the judge wrote, quote—the judge in that case wrote, ""Mr. Trump attempt to minimize sexual abuse finding it frivolous."" ""Mr. Trump 'raped' her""—no, let me—this is the judge's language, not mine—""'raped' her, as many people understand the word 'rape.'""
Folks, Donald Trump is a business fraud. He lost his license to do business in New York State—has been fined over $400 million for giving false information to banks. And he's still facing charges for mishandling classified information, which is a criminal offense.
He's still facing charges for his role in January 6, trying to overthrow the outcome of the 2020 election. He is still facing charges in Georgia for election interference. Remember his phone call? ""I just need 11,780 votes.""
Name me another President who has done any of that.
Look, if you want to know how bad a businessman Trump really is, just think about this: He inherited millions of dollars only to squander it. He's filed bankruptcy six times. He even went—he went bankrupt—even went bankrupt running a casino. I didn't think that was possible.
Audience member. The house always wins!
The President. Doesn't the house always win in a casino?
Most importantly, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Trump is a threat to this Nation. He led a violent mob on January 6 to overturn the 2020 election, to hold onto power. That I—the election that I won by 7 million votes.
Folks, and by the way, he made these claims about stealing an election. Guess what?
Audience member. Free, free Palestine! Free, free Palestine!
The President. What happened was——
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. [Inaudible] By the—by the way, no—you—you—I know.
Audience member. Hey, hey, what do you say? These babies are dying every day!
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. Folks—folks—look, give me—give me 1 second. Folks, look, I understand her passion. I understand her passion. That's why I put together a detailed plan that the United Nations accepted, that the Israelis accepted, that the Palestinians have accepted to end this war. This war must end. It must end.
Well, look, we saw with our own eyes—we saw how he sent thousands of people to attack the Capitol—Trump. We saw the police being attacked; the Capitol being ransacked; the mob hunting for the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi; gallows set up to hang Vice President Pence.
And we saw—we saw—it here in Michigan in a stark attack on your State capitol, a horrendous plot to kidnap your Governor; protests surround—protesters surrounding your home—her home—the home of your secretary of state for simply doing her job.
She is here tonight. Madam Secretary, I'm proud of you. Where are you, Madam Secretary? That's why I bestowed on the Secretary the Presidential Citizens Medal, one of the Nation's highest honors in defense of democracy.
Folks, and now Trump wants to pardon those January 6 insurrectionists.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. It's outrageous. It's wrong. And I will never let it happen.
No President has ever attempted to do what Trump tried to do. No President.
But Trump is even more dangerous now. No, I'm serious. He's unhinged. He snapped. And he refuses this time around—he refuses this time around to say he'll accept the election—of this election—the results. Can you imagine that?
Look, he says, if he loses, there will be a ""bloodbath"" when he loses.
And the United States Supreme Court said there's virtually no limit on the power of a President. Trump said if he wins, he'll be a dictator on day one. He means it, folks.
We're not going to let that happen.
Audience members. No!
The President. Over my dead body will it happen.
Folks, I don't want to complicate it, but just look at his right-wing Project 2025.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Oh, but it's really focused on—you heard about it?
Audience members. Yes!
The President. It's a blueprint for the second Trump term that every American should read and understand. Now, of course, Trump is lying about it now. He said—tries to distance himself, just like he's trying to distance himself from overturning Roe v. Wade, because he knows how toxic it is. But we're not going to let that happen. And the press—and the press shouldn't either.
Project 2025 is run and paid for by Trump people: his top policy people, his campaign press secretary, his personal bag man in the White House, the biggest funders, and more. It was a project built for Trump. Folks, Project 2025 is the biggest attack on our system of government and our personal freedom that has ever been proposed in the history of this country.
And here's the nightmare—it would—what it would unleash. Trump Project 2025 will criminalize the shipping of abortion medications—medication anywhere—anywhere to deny contraceptive covers [coverage; White House correction], allow a ban nationwide. That's what Project 2024 is—2024 is—25 is calling about.
Project 2025 will deploy the Department of Justice to prosecute Trump's energy—Trump's enemies, and that's a real deal. Trump's enemies.
Trump himself calls his campaign—the campaign—this is what he calls it, ""revenge"" and ""retribution."" That's what he said.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Well, Trump's 2025 Project will eliminate the civil service.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No, I'm serious. Not a joke. Read it.
And he will let—and it will allow him to hire tens of thousands of civil servants that are running only because they support Trump. They have to take a loyalty oath to Trump beforehand.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Folks, that's not the United States of America.
Trump's 2025 Project will cut Social Security and Medicare, rip away protections for preexisting health conditions. It will eliminate $35-a-month cap on insulin, allowing drug companies to jack up the prices—back up to 400 bucks a month; stop Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices.
And by the way, I got criticized for taking on Medicare—I mean, on—taking on the drug companies and the pharma for that. Well—well it's——
Audience member. That's all right.
The President. Damn right, it's all right. [Laughter]
But, by the way, you know what it did? When I won, it cut the Federal budget by $160 billion.
Trump's Project 2025 would eliminate the Department—he wants to eliminate the Department of Education. Not a joke.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. He wants to cut school lunch programs.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. I know this almost sounds like a joke, but it's real.
He wants to eliminate Head Start for low-income children.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. His project will allow him—employers to stop paying overtime for hourly workers, but give——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. ——but give the very wealthy another massive tax cut. The tax cut he's proposed is for $5 trillion over the next 10 years.
Folks, Project 2025—you're going to let him round up over 10 million people in America and put them in detention camps. You heard him say it. You heard him say what he wants to do. That's what he says he is going to do. Ripping them away from their homes, their schools because Trump calls them ""animals"" who ""poison the blood"" of America.
Look, folks, there's only one reason only some of Trump's plan of 2025—it goes on for 900 pages. We've never seen anything like this. And it's not a joke. It's time for us to stop treating politics like entertainment and reality TV.
Another 4 years of Donald Trump is deadly serious—deadly serious. His proposals are deadly serious. America needs to wake up and realize that Trump and his MAGA Republicans—what they're trying to do.
We're going to join them, we're going to engage them, and we're going to stop them.
And, folks, we all know it's not enough just to be against something; we have to be for something. So I am—today, I'm going to start by laying out the first hundred days in my second term.
And here it is. The first bill I'm going to introduce will restore Roe v. Wade to make it the law of the land. I will sign the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom To Vote Act.
And we're not only going to stop Trump and the MAGA Republicans from cutting Social Security and Medicare, we'll expand and strengthen Social Security and Medicare. And here's how we're going to do it. The press always ask, ""How?"" Listen, press. By making the rich pay their fair share of Social Security.
And we're going to end medical debt. By that I mean, we've already made sure medical debt can no longer be put on your credit report. We can wipe out it—medical debt for pennies on the dollar.
We're going to raise the Federal minimum wage. We're going to pass the PRO Act, ending union busting once and for all.
And I'm going to ban assault weapons again. I did it once, and I'm going to do it again.
We're going to keep leading the world—and we are—on climate and clean energy.
When I signed the American Rescue Plan, the law expanded childcare tax credit to cut child poverty in half in America, and it did. Republicans let it expire. I'm going to make the childcare tax cut permanent.
And by the way, it increases economic growth; it doesn't increase the deficit. People can work when you have a child. No, I'm serious. That's the deal.
We capped the cost of insulin for seniors at 35 bucks—totaling cost. And no senior, beginning on 2025, is going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year for all their prescription drugs, including cancer drugs that are $10-, $12-, $14,000 year.
And my second term, here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to make that same plan available for every single American. Again, saving the Federal Government hundreds of billions of dollars over time.
We're going to make housing more affordable. That means taking on corporate greed and getting the rents down. We're going to build 2 million housing units and cap rent increases at 5 percent a year so corporate landlords can no longer gouge everyone like they're doing. We can do this.
We're going to end Trump's tax cuts for the very wealthy and the corporations to make the Tax Code fair.
I kept my commitment. I thought—I think a lot of you thought, ""Why is Biden doing what he said?"" Which is, I said, ""No one making less than $400,000 will pay a penny more in Federal taxes."" I don't know many people making $400,000. In my neighborhood, no one did. [Laughter] But I wanted to be clear that I wasn't going to be taxing anyone who was a working man or even close to it.
But here is what we're going to do. We're going to make billionaires—billionaires—we have a thousand of them in America since the pandemic—pay a minimum of income—a minimum tax of 25 percent. You know what—by the way, do you know what they pay now? A billionaire's Federal tax is 8.2 percent.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Not a joke. I'm not making this up.
Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, or a nurse. It's ridiculous.
That one thing alone would generate $500 billion in revenue over the next 10 years, allowing us to do more for childcare, eldercare, bring down the Federal deficit, and do so much more.
We're going to continue to secure the southern border.
Look, after Trump killed the bipartisan effort we put together that a lot of Republicans supported as well, he called—he got on the phone, and he called all his friends because he said, ""If in fact you vote for it, it—it's going to be a win for Biden and loss for me, so don't do it."" Well, the Republican Party——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. I've got to—have to admit to you, I was a little surprised the Republican Party walked away from it.
So that's when I took executive action. I said—and since I did the border, encounters have gone down over 50 percent. And we're going to keep it going down, fixing our legal immigration and creating pathways for citizenship for ""Dreamers.""
I made it clear, there are over a half a million spouses in America—married to Americans—who don't have a green card after 10 years here. They're now going to get their green card.
Folks, the days of—failed trickle-down economics are over.
My first hundred days of a second term is going to continue to be all about working people of this Nation.
Unlike Donald Trump, I don't work for Big Oil. I don't work for Big Pharma. I don't work for the National Rifle Association. I work for you, the American people. Everyone.
Look——
Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
The President. What's America all about? Everyone in America is entitled to a fair shot—just a fair—no guarantee, a fair shot.
But in America, we're going to leave no one behind and give everybody a fair shot. That's all they are.
Folks, let me close with this. I know I look 40 years old—[laughter]—but I'm a little bit older. Hopefully, with age comes a little wisdom.
And here's what I know: I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how and I've demonstrated how to do this job. And I don't—I know Americans want a President, not a dictator.
And I also know no self-respecting American President would ever, ever, ever be Putin's puppy like this guy is. [Laughter] That's what he is.
You know, Americans want to protect their freedom not give them up. I know what America stands for. We stand for the proposition that all—all—people are created equal and deserve an equal—[applause]. No, I mean it.
We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it though. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let Donald Trump walk this Nation from—away from it.
Folks, this race is about your family. It's about your freedom. It's about democracy. Are you with me? Are we going to stop Donald Trump?
Let's get this done. And let's remember who we are. We are the United States of America and there's nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you."""

Harris From Rehoboth Beach, Delaware","""[The President joined the event, which was held at the 2024 Kamala Harris for President campaign headquarters in Wilmington, DE, via teleconference from his residence in Rehoboth Beach.]
The President. Julie, if I didn't have COVID, I'd be sitting there with you—standing there with you. And I'm so proud of what you've all done. I mean, but this COVID has been keeping me out of people's hair for the next 3 or 4 days.
But I'm going to be on the road, and I'm not going anywhere. I'm going—it's going—it's kept me away a little bit, but you know, I want people to remember that what we have done has been incredible, and we get—so much more we're going to get done.
And so I want to say hello to Kamala if she can hear me. I know she's going to be speaking shortly. And I want to say to the team: Embrace her. She's the best. I wanted to call today to thank everybody—[applause]—everybody in this effort.
I know yesterday's news is surprising and it's hard for you to hear, but it was the right thing to do. It's—I know it's hard because you've poured your heart and soul into me to help us win this thing, help me get this nomination, help me win the nomination and then go on to win the Presidency.
But you know, you're an amazing team. But we've got a great, great—I think we made the right decision. I know how hard you've worked, how many sacrifices you've made. And so many of you—so many of you—uprooted your lives for me and the kind of commitment few people make for anything these days, but you made it.
And I've been honored and humbled. I mean this from the bottom of my heart—my word as a Biden—that for all you've done for me and my family.
And you—we built the best campaign and organization in history. I've been doing this—I kid—I always kid and say, I know I'm only 40, but—[laughter]—I've been around a long time. I don't know of a better campaign organization, grassroots campaign.
You know, we have over 230 offices opened, we have over 2,000 paid staff, and we have literally several thousand volunteers on a regular basis—thousands of them. And they've been relentless and tireless in reaching out and contacting voters.
The leadership of this campaign has been amazing: Jen O'Malley Dillon, Julie, Quentin, Michael Tyler, Rob Flaherty, Rufus on raising money, and so many more. You built this team, you brought them together—you brought us together, you've inspired them, and you've done what leaders do.
Now—and we've got to—you know, the name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn't changed at all. [Applause] And by the way, I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala. I'm going to be working like hell both as a sitting President, getting legislation passed, as well as in campaigning.
You know, what—we still need to save this democracy. And Trump is still a danger to the community, he's a danger to the Nation. And just ask my foreign policy colleagues, my counterparts, and other people around the world and at home.
Look, so I'm hoping you'll give every bit of your heart and soul that you gave to me to Kamala. And I want you to know: I won't be on the ticket, but I'm still going to be fully, fully engaged. I've got 6 months left of my Presidency, and I'm determined to get as much done as I possibly can, both foreign policy and domestic policy; keep lowering costs for families; continue to speak out on guns and childcare, eldercare, prescription drugs, and climate.
Climate still is the existential threat that we face, and we have—if we don't—if we don't win this thing, it's all in jeopardy.
And we've got to keep working for an end to the war in Gaza. I'll be working very closely with the Israelis and with the Palestinians to try to work out how we can get the Gaza war to end and the Middle East peace and get all those hostages home. I think we're on a verge of being able to do that.
And we've got to keep our alliances together. It's critically important. It took a while for me to build these alliances. Most of these are—my colleagues have acknowledged that. But it's critically, critically important for our safety and security.
And I know I'll be doing whatever Kamala wants me or needs me to do in addition.
So let me be real clear. We're still fighting in this fight together. I'm not going anywhere. And I want you to know I've always—you've always had my back, and I promise you I will always have your back. And I'm anxious to—for you all to hear from Kamala.
So thank you, thank you, thank you. Julie, you're the best.
2024 Kamala Harris for President Campaign Manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez. Well, thank you so much, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you. I'm sticking around. I'm going to listen.
Ms. Chávez Rodríguez. All right. Thank you so much, Mr. President, again, for taking time to join our call today.
And you know, as the President said, we are full steam ahead in supporting the Vice President, and we are seeing incredible enthusiasm already from our supporters. From Democratic Governors to Senators to House Members to mayors to folks across the country, you know, our Democratic Party is really uniting around our nominee.
And we just announced that we raised $81 million in 24 hours.
So now I am incredibly honored to bring up the Second Gentleman to be able to mark a historic day with us today.
With that, I'd like to introduce Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff.
Audience members. Doug! Doug! Doug!
Second Gentleman Douglas C. Emhoff. Woo! Wow.
Julie, thank you so much. I've known Julie a long, long time, going back to her days working in Kamala's Senate office. And we've put a lot of time together out on the road on the last campaign, and I can't think of anyone better to be leading this campaign. So thank you so much. You're the best.
I was just very emotional listening to President Biden just then. I was emotional before I heard that because of who he is and what he represents: the dignity, the empathy.
He's had my back personally. Some of my toughest moments as Second Gentleman. One, leaving the career that I loved, it was always the President who came up to me and said: ""Look, I know—I know, kid. You're a great lawyer. I know this must have been tough."" [Laughter] ""But what better way to leave that than to support your wife, who you love so much, and your country that you love so much.""
And it's hard to believe it was about 4 years ago—the first time I came to Wilmington is when she got the call from President—then-candidate Biden to be on the ticket. And we came here the next day. We went to their home. And he said, with Dr. Biden: ""Welcome to the family. You're now Bidens.""
And they made us cookies. And they called our kids. And they called my parents. This was day one 4 years ago. And now look where we are now. To have been able to serve as Second Gentleman with him as our President, Dr. Biden as our First Lady—unbelievable.
And now—now—I get to support my wife, Kamala Harris, running for President of the United States. And let me tell you something: We are going to win this election. We're on the right side of every single issue, and we have this team right here and thousands of others all around the country.
How do I know? Because I've been traveling all around the country—[laughter]—and I've met them. We have an amazing team, you have done an amazing job, and you're going to continue to do that so we can elect Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States of America.
So let's hear it for Kamala Harris.
Thank you.
Vice President Kamala D. Harris. The first Second Gentleman of the United States.
Hi, everybody—hey, Delaware. [Laughter]
Audience members. Kamala! Kamala! Kamala!
Vice President Harris. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.
Can we just give it up again for my husband? [Laughter]
It is so good to hear our President's voice. Joe, I know you're still on the call. And we've been talking every day. You probably—you guys heard it from Doug's voice. We love Joe and Jill. We really do. They truly are like family to us.
Audience member. So do we.
Vice President Harris. And we do—everybody here does. Everybody——
The President. It's mutual. [Laughter]
Vice President Harris. I knew you were still there. You're not going anywhere, Joe.
The President. I'm watching you, kid. I'm watching you, kid. [Laughter] I love you.
Vice President Harris. I love you, Joe. [Applause] Oh.
So, Joe, I'm going to recognize some of the electeds who are here, and then I'm going to get back to you. Hold on a second. [Laughter]
So let me do, please, acknowledge some extraordinary national leaders who are also dear friends both to the President and to me.
Governor John Carney, where are you? There you are. And his wife, they are here. Senator Tom Carper, my former colleague, and his wife is here. Chris Coons, my dear friend. Attorney General Kathy Jennings.
The mayor is here. Purzycki, where are you? [Applause] There.
And the next United States Senator from the great State of Delaware is here, Lisa Blunt Rochester.
And I know everyone here has seen these elected leaders in this very campaign office on a regular basis. And I know Joe is so thankful to them for their lifelong friendship, but I want to thank them also because you guys have really been carrying some heavy water from the first days of our campaign. So thank you all. This truly is a Delaware family. Thank you.
I want to thank Jen O'Malley Dillon. Where is she, Jen? Jen—I'm going to talk about her in a minute. Julie Chávez Rodríguez; Sheila Nix—there you are; and the entire team that is here. I want to thank all of you and those who are joining from offices across our Nation.
So Doug and I wanted to stop by today to thank everybody and to express just what we know to be true: You all have been working so hard. The people in this office have been working so hard. And you have given so much of yourselves: long days and nights, what you are sacrificing in terms of the time you could be spending with other friends and other family—[laughter]—and you're giving yourselves to our country because you love our country and you love Joe and you love me, and we know that.
And so today, just right after Joe made his announcement, it was important for me to continue with his role of leadership in this office of, like him, who has said for many, many, many months, and I say it today: Thank you all so very much for what you are doing and what you will continue to do. [Applause]
So let's applaud the team here.
And I know it's been a roller coaster, and we're all filled with so many mixed emotions about this. I just have to say, I love Joe Biden. I love Joe Biden, and I know we all do. And we have so many darn good reasons for loving Joe Biden. [Laughter] And I have full faith that this team is—the team will be the reason we win in November, you all who are here.
And as Julie always says, and I will quote the great Julie, ""We are one team, one fight""—[applause]—""one team, one fight."" And she's been an extraordinary campaign manager. She's going to continue in this role and see us to victory in November.
And we are all here because we love our country, right? And we believe in our foundational principles. We believe in freedom and opportunity and justice, not for some, but for all.
And so we have 106 days until election day, and in that time, we have some hard work to do. And as J.O.D. always reminds us, we can do hard things. J.O.D. has been such an incredible leader of this team, and that is why I have just asked her to run my campaign, and she has accepted.
And so, over the next 106 days, we are going to take our case to the American people, and we are going to win. We are going to win.
And so I'm—now I'm getting back to you, Joe. I will tell you all, it has been one of the greatest honors of my life, truly, to serve as Vice President to our President, Joe Biden. Joe's legacy of accomplishment just over—a lifetime, but just over the last 3½ years is unmatched in modern history. In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most Presidents who served two terms in office.
Think about it. And I know everyone here in the campaign, we have—we know—[laughter]—but—if we don't know, we've got a problem. [Laughter] But I'm going to repeat some for those who might be guests at the moment. [Laughter]
Joe got the COVID-19 pandemic under control. Remember those days? He has created more than 15 million new jobs. He brought together Republicans and Democrats and passed historic legislation.
And I'm going to tell you, I'm a firsthand witness to all this work. I would sit with Joe in the Oval Office while he would bring Members of both sides to—of the aisle and talk and listen and help them see what they may have in common and how we can actually work towards solutions. And because of their confidence in Joe, these accomplishments occurred.
Joe has stood up for democracy at home, and he has stood up for democracy abroad, and he has always stood up for what he believes is right.
And many of you may know I first came to know Joe through his son Beau. Beau and I worked together as State attorneys general. And back then, Beau would often tell me stories about his dad, and he would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is. And he would talk about the qualities of his father. And the qualities that Beau revered the most are the same qualities that I see every day in our President: his honesty; his integrity; his commitment to his faith and his family; his big, big heart; and his deep love of our country.
And I don't need to tell you all. You know Joe's background, right? I mean, he grew up in a middle class family in Scranton. And he has never forgotten where he comes from.
And so, again, I am a firsthand witness from being with him in the Oval Office to the Situation Room and seeing him on the global stage with world leaders. President Joe Biden fights for the American people, and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our Nation.
Joe, are you watching? Do you hear this clapping? [Laughter] Can you see it?
The President. I'm watching. [Laughter] I'm watching.
Vice President Harris. I knew it.
Audience member. Thank you, Joe!
Audience member. We love you, Joe!
The President. You're the best, kid.
Vice President Harris. And let us be very clear, Joe is not done, far from it. He knows there is still more work to do, and our Nation will continue to praise his bold and visionary leadership as President.
Thank you, Joe.
The President. Thank you.
Vice President Harris. And it is my great honor to have Joe's endorsement in this race.
The President. You sure do.
Vice President Harris. And it is my intention to go out and earn this nomination and to win.
So, in the days and weeks ahead, I, together with you, will do everything in my power to unite our Democratic Party, to unite our Nation, and to win this election.
You know, as many of you know, before I was elected as Vice President, before I was elected as United States Senator, I was the elected attorney general, as I've mentioned, of California. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor.
In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds—[laughter].
Audience member. Go on! [Laughter]
Vice President Harris. Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type.
And in this campaign, I will proudly—I will proudly—put my record against his.
As a young prosecutor, when I was in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office in California, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse. Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse.
As attorney general of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges and put it out of business. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college, Trump University, that was forced to pay $25 million to the students it scammed.
As district attorney, to go after polluters, I created one of the first environmental justice units in our Nation. Donald Trump stood in Mar-a-Lago and told Big Oil lobbyists he would do their bidding for a $1 billion campaign contribution.
Audience members. Boo!
Audience member. Cheater.
Vice President Harris. During—[laughter]. During the foreclosure crisis, I took on the big Wall Street banks and won $20 billion for California families, holding those banks accountable for fraud. Donald Trump was just found guilty of 34 counts of fraud.
Audience members. Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!
Vice President Harris. But make no mistake, all of that being said, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. There is more to this campaign than that.
Our campaign has always been about two different versions of what we see as the future of our country—two different visions for the future of our country: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.
Donald Trump wants to take our country backward to a time before many of our fellow Americans had full freedoms and rights.
But we believe in a brighter future that makes room for all Americans. We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.
We believe in a future where no child has to grow up in poverty; where every person can buy a home, start a family, and build wealth; and where every person has access to paid family leave and affordable childcare. [Applause] That's the future we see.
Together, we fight to build a nation where every person has affordable health care, where every worker is paid fairly, and where every senior can retire with dignity. All of this is to say building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my Presidency. Because we here know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong.
And we know that's not the future Donald Trump is fighting for. He and his——
Audience member. [Inaudible] [Laughter]
Vice President Harris. He and his extreme Project 2025 will weaken the middle class and bring us backward—please do note that—back to the failed trickle-down policies that gave huge tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and made working families pay the cost; back to policies that put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block; back to policies that treat health care as only a privilege for the wealthy, instead of what we all know it should be, which is a right for every American.
America has tried these economic policies before. They do not lead to prosperity. They lead to inequity and economic injustice, and we are not going back. We are not going back. They're not taking us back.
Our fight for the future is also a fight for freedom. Generations of Americans before us have led the fight for freedom, from our Founders to our Framers, to the abolitionists and the suffragettes, to the Freedom Riders and farmworkers.
And now I say, team, the baton is in our hands. We who believe in the sacred freedom to vote. We who are committed to fight to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom To Vote Act.
We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence, and that's why we will work to pass universal background checks, ""red flag"" laws, and an assault weapons ban.
We who will fight for reproductive freedom, knowing if Trump gets the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every single State. But we are not going to let that happen.
It is this team here that is going to help in this November to elect a majority of Members of the United States Congress who agree the government should not be telling a woman what to do with her body. And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as President of the United States, I will sign it into law.
Audience member. We the people!
Vice President Harris. Indeed. [Laughter] We the people.
So, ultimately, to all the friends here, I say: In this election, we know we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in: a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law——
Audience member. Yes! [Laughter]
Vice President Harris. ——or a country of chaos, fear, and hate?
Audience members. No!
Vice President Harris. You all are here because you, as leaders, know we each—including our neighbors and our friends and our family, we each, as Americans, have the power to answer that question. That's the beauty of it—the power of the people. We each have the ability to answer that question.
So, in the next 106 days, we have work to do. We have doors to knock on. We have people to talk to, we have phone calls to make, and we have an election to win.
So are you ready to get to work?
Do we believe in freedom? Do we believe in opportunity? Do we believe in the promise of America? And are we willing to fight for it?
Audience members. Yes!
Vice President Harris. And when we fight——
Audience members. We win!
Vice President Harris. ——we win.
God bless you all, and God bless the United States of America and Joe Biden.""	Remarks at a Campaign Event for Vice President Kamala D. Harris From Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"
"Jul 24, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-the-nation-the-presidents-decision-not-seek-reelection,Address to the Nation on the President's Decision Not To Seek Reelection,"""My fellow Americans, I'm speaking to you tonight from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.
In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American Presidents: Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the immortal words that guide this Nation; George Washington, who showed us Presidents are not kings; Abraham Lincoln, who implored us to reject malice; Franklin Roosevelt, who inspired us to reject fear.
I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your President. But, in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.
I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union, it's not about me. It's about you, your families, your futures. It's about ""We the People."" And we can never forget that, and I never have.
I've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine our fate of our Nation and the world for decades to come. America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division.
We have to decide: Do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect; freedom, justice, and democracy? In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies or—but as friends—as fellow Americans. Can we do that? Does character in public life still matter?
I believe I know the answer to these questions, because I know you, the American people. And I know this: We are a great nation because we are a good people.
When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. And the truth, the sacred cause of this country is larger than any one of us. And those of us who cherish that cause—cherish it so much—the cause of American democracy itself—must unite to protect it.
You know, in recent weeks, it's become clear to me that I needed to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as President, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term, but nothing—nothing—can come in the way of saving our democracy. And that includes personal ambition.
So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our Nation.
You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. But there is also a time and place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.
Over the next 6 months, I'll be focused on doing my job as President. That means I'll continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose. And I'll keep calling out hate and extremism and make it clear there is no place—no place—in America for political violence or any violence at—ever, period.
I'm going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis. It is the existential threat. And I will keep fighting my—for my Cancer Moonshot so we can end cancer as we know it, because we can do it. And I'm going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy—Supreme Court reform.
You know, I will keep working to ensure America remains strong and secure and the leader of the free world. I'm the first President in this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world.
We'll keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We'll keep NATO stronger, and I'll make it more powerful and more united than any time in all of our history. And I'll keep doing the same for our allies in the Pacific.
You know, when I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably—would inevitably pass the United—surpass the United States. That's not the case anymore.
And I'm going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages, and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war.
We're also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world.
You know, we've come so far since my Inauguration. On that day, I told you as I stood in that winter—we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities—peril and possibilities.
We're in the grip of the worst—we were in the grip of the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. But we came together as Americans, and we got through it.
We emerged stronger, more prosperous, and more secure.
And today, we have the strongest economy in the world, creating nearly 16 million new jobs—a record. Wages are up. Inflation continues to come down. The racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years.
We're literally rebuilding our entire Nation: urban, suburban, rural, and Tribal communities. Manufacturing has come back to America. We're leading the world again in chips and science and innovation.
And we finally beat Big Pharma after all these years to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors. And I'm going to keep fighting to make sure we lower the costs for everyone, not just seniors.
More people have health care today in America than ever before. And I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans and their families who were exposed to toxic materials.
You know, the most significant climate law ever—ever—in the history of the world. The first major gun safety law in 30 years. And today, violent—the violent crime rate is at a 50-year low.
We're also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office.
And I've kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I also kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and to be a President for all Americans. That's what I've done.
I ran for President 4 years ago because I believed—and still do—that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake. And that's still the case.
America is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It's the most powerful idea in the history of the world.
That idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident. We're all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.
We've never fully lived up to it—to this sacred idea—but we've never walked away from it either. And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.
In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future. I made my choice. I've made my views known.
I would like to thank our great Vice President, Kamala Harris. She's experienced. She's tough. She's capable. She has been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.
Now the choice is up to you, the American people. When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin, who's hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office alongside the busts of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and César Chávez.
When Ben Franklin was asked as he emerged from the Convention going on whether the Founders had given America a monarchy or a republic, Franklin's response was, ""A republic, if you can keep it."" ""A republic, if you can keep it."" Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands.
My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life to serve this Nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States. But here I am.
That's what's so special about America. We are a nation of promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things.
I've given my heart and my soul to our Nation, like so many others. And I have been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people.
I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you. The great thing about America is, here kings and dictators do not rule, the people do.
History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.
We just have to keep faith—keep the faith—and remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there is simply nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we do it together. So let's act together, preserve our democracy.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you.""	Address to the Nation on the President's Decision Not To Seek Reelection"

Raised in Australia, Martin made aliyah in 1973, moving to Israel and volunteering on a kibbutz. He chose to devote his career to the work of building peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors, inspired by the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War. His commitment to peace was rooted in witnessing that conflict and realizing that Israel's existence is fragile, peace is the only path to lasting security, and the United States must be a part of that endeavor.
As a member of President Clinton's National Security Council and two-time U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Martin played an essential role in the Oslo Accords and the follow-on negotiations, the closest that Israelis and Palestinians have ever come to making peace. He was also America's Ambassador to Israel on that fateful day in 1995 when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated. Martin rushed to the hospital to console Rabin's wife Leah, representing the American people's empathy and grief at a pivotal moment.
He and I worked together during the Obama-Biden administration, when Martin served as Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations, the last time the two parties engaged seriously on final status negotiations. More recently, he has been a voice of clarity and conviction since the horrific October 7 attack by Hamas and during the war in Gaza. His legacy lives on in the many officials across my administration who were mentored by Martin and learned firsthand from his vast knowledge, integrity, and heart. His unshakeable optimism and commitment to peace is as important today as it's ever been.
Jill and I are holding Martin's family in our thoughts, especially his beloved wife Gahl, his children Jacob and Sarah, stepchildren Christopher and Caroline, brother and sister, and five grandchildren.

Subject: Deferred Enforced Departure for Certain Lebanese Nationals 

Humanitarian conditions in southern Lebanon have significantly deteriorated due to tensions between Hezbollah and Israel. While I remain focused on de-escalating the situation and improving humanitarian conditions, many civilians remain in danger; therefore, I am directing the deferral of removal of certain Lebanese nationals who are present in the United States.

Pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States, I have determined that it is in the foreign policy interest of the United States to defer for 18 months the removal of any Lebanese national subject to the conditions and exceptions provided below.

Accordingly, I hereby direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate measures to defer for 18 months the removal of any Lebanese national who is present in the United States on the date of this memorandum, except for those:

(1) who have voluntarily returned to Lebanon after the date of this memorandum;

(2) who have not continuously resided in the United States since the date of this memorandum;

(3) who are inadmissible under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) or deportable under section 237(a)(4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4));

(4) who have been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors committed in the United States, or who meet any of the criteria set forth in section 208(b)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A));

(5) who are subject to extradition;

(6) whose presence in the United States the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined is not in the interest of the United States or presents a danger to public safety; or

(7) whose presence in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.

I further direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to take appropriate measures to authorize employment for noncitizens whose removal has been deferred, as provided by this memorandum, for the duration of such deferral, and to consider suspending regulatory requirements with respect to F-1 nonimmigrant students who are Lebanese nationals as the Secretary of Homeland Security determines to be appropriate.

The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Harris greeted the three U.S. citizens released from detention—Paul N. Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, and Alsu Kurmasheva—upon their return to the U.S. The Permanent Resident who was also released, Vladimir Kara-Murza, traveled separately to Germany following his release.]
Q. Mr. President, how does it feel?
The President. Wonderful. It feels wonderful. A long time in coming, but I was absolutely convinced we would get it done.
I meant what I said: Alliances make a difference. They stepped up, they took a chance for us, and it mattered a lot.
So I'm delighted they're home.
U.S. Diplomatic Efforts Leading to the Release Deal 
Q. You said earlier that all these negotiations required tough calls. What was the toughest call in this one?
The President. The toughest call in this one was for other countries—is their—I asked them to do some things that were against their immediate self-interest and really very difficult for them to do, particularly Germany and Slovenia.
Slovenia came in at the last minute, and I tell you what, the Chancellor was incredible. He was incredible. So——
Safety Concerns for U.S. Citizens Overseas 
Q. Sir—sir, what's your message to other countries that maybe think that taking Americans into their custody, unlawfully detaining them would be a good way to get something that they want from us?
The President. Hey, look, that's been the case for all of history. But my job is to make sure that, number one, they don't get them, and if they do, we get them back.
I don't buy this idea that you're not going to let—you're going to let these people rot in jail because other people may be captured.
We've sent out all the notifications to all the other countries—all our citizens of countries not to go to, what to do, what not to do, and they've got to pay attention.
I've got more work to do, so——
Q. Madam Vice President, how do you feel?
Vice President Harris. This is an extraordinary day. And I'm very thankful for our President and what he has done over his entire career, but in particular, as it relates to these families and these individuals; what he has been able to do to bring the allies together on many issues, but in particular, this one.
This is just an extraordinary testament to the importance of having a President who understands the power of diplomacy and understands the strength that rests in understanding the significance of diplomacy and strengthening alliances.
This is an incredible day. And I got to see it in the families and in their eyes and in their cries.
Importance of U.S. Diplomatic Relationships 
Q. When did you know you got the deal done?
The President. A while ago. We've got to make sure—wanted to make sure everything was in place. And Slovenia made the right move at the right time.
So, anyway, look, it gets down trust. It's—and I really—I mean it. I know everybody thinks I talk about the notion of relationships with foreign policy—with other countries. Much of it—and you've heard me kid with Barack—he'd kid me—all politics is personal. It matters. Other leaders trust you, you trust them, you get things done. And that's how this got done: with a lot of help.
Anyway, thank you.
Israel/Conflict in Gaza, Palestinian Territories/Cease-Fire Negotiations 
Q. Mr. President, how worried are you that the Middle East is going to—[inaudible]?
The President. I'm very concerned about it. I had a very direct meeting with the Prime Minister today and—very direct. We've got a—we have the basis for a cease-fire. He should move on it, and they should move on it now.
Death of Hamas Political Bureau Leader Ismail Haniyeh in an Explosion in Tehran, Iran, on July 31 
Q. Is that chance for a cease-fire ruined after the assassination of Haniyeh?
The President. Pardon me?
Q. Is the chance for a cease-fire ruined after the assassination of Haniyeh?
The President. It's not helped.
Q. Do you expect Iran to strike back?
The President. That's all I'm going to say right now.
Thank you.
[At this point, the President and Vice President Harris moved to another location on the tarmac. After briefly boarding the aircraft that carried the released U.S. citizens, the President rejoined the Vice President on the tarmac, and they visited with the released detainees and their families. They then walked across the tarmac, and reporters began shouting questions.]
Q. Mr. President——
Q. Mr. President, would you come talk to us for a second, please? Mr. President, we couldn't see you. Can you come talk to us for one second? Come on, Mr. President.
[The President jogged over to where reporters were gathered, followed by Vice President Harris.]
Q. Thank you, sir. This mike right here.
Q. Mr. President——
[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]
Release of U.S. Citizens From Detention in Russia 
Q. Mr. President, what—how did you process seeing those three Americans come off the plane? What—how did you process this moment?
The President. With great satisfaction and a feeling of relief for their families.
Q. Did you think that this moment would come, sir?
The President. Yes.
Value of U.S. Diplomacy 
Q. What made you feel so confident?
The President. My relationship with the other heads of state that I had to get to agree on a lot of this.
Q. Tell us what you said with the heart.
Q. How did it compare——
[Several reporters spoke at once.]
Q. What did you have to say to the families, sir?
Q. What did you say?
Q. And what did you have to say to the family members and the three Americans, sir?
The President. Pardon me?
Release of U.S. Citizens From Detention in Russia 
Q. What did you have to say to the three Americans and their family members, sir?
The President. Welcome home and beyond that.
The President's Visits With the Families of Released Detainees 
Q. You said, sir, that family is everything earlier today. What has it meant to be with the family all day today as they are now finally reunited with their loved ones?
The President. You can appreciate—look, anyone who's lost family or worried about whether family would come home, whatever the circumstance was, has to understand the extreme—and you've heard me say it before. My dad used to say, ""Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end."" And it really is. It's about who we are. It's about who we are as a country.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. What is your message tonight to Vladimir Putin?
The President. Stop.
Q. What is your message to the American people, sir?
Q. Stop. Stop what?

Value of U.S. Diplomacy
Q. The American people are watching this broadcast tonight, and I think it's fair to say they're celebrating with the families. What's your message to the American people?
The President. There's nothing beyond our capacity when we act together—nothing, nothing, nothing. Remember who the hell we are. We're the United States of America. The United States of America. And we put back together with—relationships with countries that we haven't had before. We rebuilt NATO. We rebuilt the circumstances allowing this to happen. That's why it happened.
Safety of U.S. Journalists Overseas 
Q. And, Mr. President, should American journalists ever feel afraid about reporting abroad?
The President. I think—look, no matter where you are, there's certain places that you're going to be afraid. I mean, I'm—the idea you're never going to be afraid, you'd never show up anywhere in the Middle East, you wouldn't show up anywhere in Russia, you wouldn't show up anywhere. It matters. It matters to be aware of what you're going into and not to take undue chances because it's going to—because I'm going to come get you.
Release of U.S. Citizens and Permanent Resident From Detention in Russia 
Q. Of your many achievements——
Q. And, Mr. President, how——
Q. ——where does this rank among your many achievements as President?
The President. Well, look, this is—to me, this is about the essence of who we are as a country. It really is about personal relationships. It's about family. It's about being able to have access to your own—the people you love and you adore.
Imagine how you'd all feel if you had—you were—you were being held captive unfairly and you had children waiting at home for you. Imagine how you'd feel.
How many of you have children? Raise your hand. Yes. Okay?
Well, imagine being—sitting in a prison, not know you'll ever get home and wondering what's going on with your children, how they go to bed at night crying, how they ache every night and every day you're gone. It matters.

The President's Role in Negotiating the Release Deal 
Q. Mr. President, we understand that a very important phone call that you made——
Q. Mr. President, what do you want to ask Putin? Mr. President——
Q. ——to the Prime Minister of Slovenia came hours before you announced that you were going to be leaving the 2024 race. Can you talk to us a little bit about how important it was for you to get this deal done, knowing that you were not going to seek a second term? Was it very important——
The President. I'd still get it done even if I was seeking a second term. Not in the—I'm still—you're stuck with me as President for a while, kid. There's no way out. Okay? You've got me for at least another hundred—90 days or so.
So it didn't have anything to do with that. It had to do with the opportunity and trying to convince one last country to say, okay, they'll step up.
And look——
Q. Mr. President, how critical—how critical——
[Several reporters spoke at once.]
Remainder of the President's Term 
Q. And, Mr. President, certainly this will now be cemented as a part of your one-term legacy. How are you thinking about the rest of your time in office? How are you——
The President. Oh, we can talk about that another time.
[Several reporters spoke at once.]
Q. Mr. President, what's your message to other Americans imprisoned abroad, sir?
U.S. Diplomatic Efforts in Securing the Release Deal 
Q. Mr. President, how critical—how critical was Chancellor Scholz's commitment to getting this deal across the finish line? Could it have been possible without that agreement——
The President. No.
Q. ——that he made?
Q. Mr. President——
[Reporters continued to shout questions, and Vice President Harris and the President responded to different reporters simultaneously as follows.]
Q. Madam Vice President—Madam Vice President, your reaction tonight?
Vice President Harris. It's a very good night. It's a very good night. And it's testament to the work that we prioritize under Joe Biden's leadership and our administration, which is the importance of building alliances, building the strength that we have through diplomacy to have outcomes like this. And there's so much at stake right now in our country and in this upcoming election, including who has which approach to understanding America's strength. This is an example of the strength of American leadership in bringing nations together to deliver Americans back to their families.
The President's Role in Securing the Release Deal/U.S. Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. [Inaudible]—the Americans hostage—held hostage in the Middle East. You promised them that you would—[inaudible]?
The President. [Inaudible]—my power as the President to use all resources I have to get them out. That's what I promised. That's what I promised. And I can tell you, personal relationships matter. [Inaudible]—it helps. If they don't, it doesn't help. So it matters.

The President. It's critically important. I started this back in the administration with President—at the time, when I was Vice President.

And we found out that—I traveled to every major cancer research facility in the world. And we found out that there's a lot more we could do if they shared more data and information. It wasn't being shared. That was the Cancer Moonshot.

And then, when I got elected when I ran for President, I decided to set up a cancer facility patterned on DARPA, which is the Defense Intelligence Agency position that is separate and apart from everything else. They're the ones that came up with everything from—anyway, they—all of the major breakthroughs.

Well, hello, everybody.
Welcome, all my former colleagues, colleagues, and members of the administration and those outside the administration that made this happen.
I was—I want to say one thing at the outset. I never thought that, having been in the Senate for so many years, as well as Vice President for 12 years—for 8 years and President for 4 years, that I'd see an effort—we would worry about people wanting to erase history—to literally erase history: what we can't read, what we can't write, what—and what I'm excited about, beyond the specifics of this: We're rewriting history—we're allowing history to be written—what happened—so our children, our grandchildren, everybody understands what happened and what could still happen. As a matter of fact, something happened here similar recently.
And so, you know, I want to thank—especially thanks to Senator Duckworth and Senator Durbin and Senator—I mean Representative—excuse me—Budzinski—like ""Bidenzinski""—[laughter]—Nikki.
By the way, I moved from a Irish neighbor in Scranton when we—when coal died, moved down to Delaware. I was the only kid with a name who didn't—name didn't end in ""s-k-i."" [Laughter]
Now, look, you know, over a hundred years ago this week, a mob not far from Lincoln's home unleashed a race riot in Springfield and—that literally shocked the conscience of the Nation. I mean, it shocked the conscience of the Nation.
But what these folks worked so hard to make sure we—a lot of people forgot it. It was railroad tracks—there was a lot going on there. And people forgot it as if, you know, it didn't happen. If you listen to some of our colleagues, you'd think: ""Oh, no, no, no. We've never had this problem.""
Well, you know, you're going to continue to have these problems unless we talk about the problems we had before making sure we solved them.
And it also sparked the creation of the NAACP and the leaders here today—one of the most important organizations, in my view, in this country.
And by signing this designation for the Springfield 1908 Race Riot National Monument, we remind ourselves we have to—we have no safe harbor unless we continue to remind people what happened—what happened. It's really important.
I'm not—I'm—you know, as you've heard me say, when I had an operation years ago, the doctor said—he told me what my chances were. And he said, ""You know, your problem is, you're—Senator,"" he said, ""you're a congenital optimist."" [Laughter] Well, I am an optimist. I'm optimistic about this country because we're good people. But we can't let these things fade.
And I want to thank the engineering firm who went out and found the remnants of a facility. I want to thank the Catholic hospital for donating the site there to make this happen, and all these people behind me.
And by the way, we have a Secretary of Interior who knows what she's doing. She cares a lot about all this.
And so I know this may not seem significant to most Americans, but it's an important—it's important, important, important. And then, when you walk by this area, you know what happened here, because it can happen again if we don't take care of ourselves and fight for this democracy.
So I'm going to sign this. And what I'm going to do, because they didn't want to bring out 99 Biden pens—[laughter]—I'm going to give this first signing to the Secretary, and then you've got to make sure every one of you get—who made this happen can get a pen. Okay?
All right.
[At this point, the President signed the proclamation.]
There you go.
[Inaudible] We don't usually do this, but, Dick, do you want to say anything? Or, Nikki, you want to say anything? Or—no, seriously, you guys worked like—you started this in 2022, I think.
Senator L. Tammy Duckworth. I did, Mr. President. Actually, we started it even before then, but we really gained steam and got it passed out of the Senate, and it's been stuck in the House.
And so I just want to thank everybody here who came together to work so hard, because this is such an important part of our Nation's history, what the Midwest has done—what the Midwest has done in terms of being part of the civil rights movement.
So much of what happened in the South started and was supported through places in Chicago and in Springfield. And I'm so proud that Springfield, Illinois, is home to the beginning of the NAACP.
Good things can come out of bad things, as long as you don't forget what happened.
The President. Yes.
Sen. Duckworth. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you.
Participants. Thank you.
The President. Dick?
Senator Richard J. Durbin. This was not the only race riot in America by any means. My hometown of East St. Louis, Illinois, had one as well.
Participants. Yes.
Sen. Durbin. The difference here was, it was the home of Abraham Lincoln. At that moment in history, people reflected on the fact and were stunned and outraged to think this happened in Mr. Lincoln's hometown.
And I think that's what inspired the NAACP, Mr. President.
Participants. Yes.
Sen. Durbin. That's why that has national significance. But it was the connection with Lincoln that really drove home the point that racism has to end in America, and we're still fighting that battle.
The President. Nikki?
Representative Nikki Budzinski. I would just add, again, an appreciation to you, Mr. President, for honoring this moment in history for Springfield and this—just the unanimous support for the community.
This is a happy day for us, but then we have so much more work to do in our community and to strive for equality and justice. We still have a lot of work to do.
The President. You know, I got involved in politics because of the—this movement. My State, to its great shame, was a slave State. And when I got elected, I ran to begin to change the nature of the parties.
To make a long story short, we're making a lot of progress, but it can never stop. We can give hate no safe harbor. Period.
Thank you.

My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, nearly 4 years ago in winter, on the steps of the Capitol on a cold January day, I raised my right hand, and I swore an oath to you and to God to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution and to faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States.
In front of me—in front of me—was a city surrounded by the National Guard. Behind me, a Capitol that just 2 weeks before had been overrun by a violent mob. But I knew then, from the bottom of my heart, as I do now: There is no place in America for political violence. None.
You cannot say you love your country only when you win.
In that moment, I wasn't looking to the past. I was looking to the future. I spoke to the work at hand, the moment we had to meet. It was, as I told you then, a ""winter of peril and possibility""—""of peril and possibility.""

Now it's summer. The winter has passed. And, with a grateful heart, I stand before you now on this August night to report that democracy has prevailed. Democracy—democracy—has delivered. And now democracy must be preserved.
You've heard me say it before. We're facing an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our Nation and the world for decades to come. That's not hyperbole. I mean it literally. We're in a battle for the very soul of America.
I ran for President in 2020 because of what I saw in Charlottesville in August of 2017: extremists coming out of the woods carrying torches, their veins bulging from their necks, carrying Nazi swastikas, and chanting the same exact anti-Semitic bile that was heard in Germany in the early thirties. Neo-Nazis, White supremacists, and the Kl Klux Klan so emboldened by a President then in the White House that they saw as an ally, they didn't even bother to wear their hoods.
Hate was on the march in America, old ghosts in new garments stirring up the oldest divisions, stoking the oldest fears, giving oxygen to the oldest forces that they long sought to tear apart America.
In the process, a young woman was killed. When I contacted her mother, I asked about what happened. She told me. When the President was asked what he thought had happened, Donald Trump said, and I quote, there were ""very fine people on both sides."" My God.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. That's what he said. That is what he said and what he meant. That's when I realized—had to listen to the admonition of my dead son—I could not stay on the sidelines. So I ran. Because I had no intention of running again. I'd just lost part of my soul.
But I ran with a deep conviction in America I know and believe—in an America where honesty, dignity, decency still matter; an America where everyone has a fair shot and hate has no safe harbor; an America where the fundamental creed of this Nation that all of us are created equal is still very much alive.
And a broad coalition of Americans joined with me. Eighty-one million voters voted for us, more than any time in all of history. Because of all of you in this room and others, we came together in 2020 to save democracy.
As your President, I've been determined to keep America moving forward, not going back; to stand against hate and violence in all its forms; to be a nation where we not only live with the—and—but thrive on diversity; demonizing no one; leaving no one behind; and becoming the nation that we profess to be.
I also ran to rebuild the backbone of America: the middle class.
I made a commitment to you that I'd be a President for all Americans, whether you voted for me or not. We have done that. Studies show the major bills we have passed actually delivered more to red States than blue. Because the job of the President is to deliver to all of America.
And because of you—and I'm not exaggerating—because of you, we've had one of the most extraordinary 4 years of progress ever. Period. When I say ""we,"" I mean Kamala and me.
Just think about it. COVID no longer controls our lives. We've gone from economic crisis to the strongest economy in the entire world: a record 16 million new jobs; record small-business growth; record high stock market; record high 401(k)s; wages up and inflation down—way down—and continuing to go down; the smallest racial wealth gap in 20 years.
And yes, we both know we have more to do, but we're moving in the right direction. More Americans have peace of mind that comes from having health insurance. More Americans have health insurance today than ever before in American history. And after—as a young Senator beginning to fight—beginning to fight for 50 years to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, we finally beat Big Pharma.
And guess who cast the tie-breaking vote? Vice President and soon-to-be President Kamala Harris. And now it's the law of the land. Instead of paying $400 a month for insulin, seniors with diabetes will pay $35 a month. The law we passed already includes, starting in January, every senior's total prescription costs can be capped at $2,000, no matter how expensive the drugs they have.
And what we don't focus on and our Republican friends don't seem to understand: Our reforms don't just save seniors money, they save the American taxpayers money. You know what we just passed saves? It saved $160 billion over the next decade. And that's not hyperbole. It's because Medicare no longer has to pay those exorbitant prices to the Big Pharma.
Audience members. Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
The President. But look—folks——
Audience members. Thank you, Joe!
The President. Thank you, Kamala, too.
Audience members. Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
The President. Look—folks, how can we have the strongest economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world? Donald Trump promised ""infrastructure week"" every week for 4 years—[laughter]—and he never built a damn thing.
But now, because of what Kamala and I have done—remember we were told we couldn't get it done? Remember when we came into office, we couldn't get anything passed? But right now we're giving America an infrastructure decade, not week.
We're modernizing our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our trains, our buses. We're removing every lead pipe from schools and homes so every child can drink clean water. We're providing affordable high-speed internet for every American, no matter where they live, unlike—not unlike what Roosevelt did with electricity—and so much more.
We are uniting the country. We're growing our economy. We're improving our quality of life. And we're building a better America. Because that's who we are.
Audience members. Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
The President. How can we be the strongest nation in the world without leading the world in science and technology?
After years of importing 90 percent of our semiconductor chips from abroad, which America invented that—those chips, our CHIPS and Science Act meant that private companies from around the world are now investing literally tens of billions of dollars to build new chip factories right here in America. And, over that period, they'll create tens of thousands of jobs and many of those jobs in the so-called fabs they're building to make the chips that are being constructed now. And guess what? The average salary in those fabs the size of a football field will be over $100,000 a year, and you don't need a college degree.
Because of you and so many electeds out there, American manufacturing is back. Where the hell does it say we wouldn't lead the world in manufacturing? Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs.
Our Republican friends and others made sure they'd go abroad to get the cheapest labor. We used to import products and export jobs. Now we export American products and create American jobs right here in America, where jobs belong.
With every new job, with every new factory, pride and hope is being brought back to communities throughout the country that were left behind. You know. You're from them, many of you. You know what it's like when that factory closed where your mother, your father, your grandmother or grandfather worked. And now you're back, providing once again—proving that Wall Street didn't build America, the middle class built America and unions—unions—built the middle class.
It's been my view since I came to the Senate. And that's why I'm proud to have been the first President to walk a picket line and be labeled the most pro-union President in history, and I accept it. It's a fact. Because when unions do well, we all do well.
Audience members. Union Joe! Union Joe! Union Joe!
The President. You've got it, man. You've got it.
Audience members. Union Joe! Union Joe! Union Joe!
The President. I agree. I'm proud.
Look, remember we were told we couldn't get anything done because this—the—we couldn't get anything done in the Congress? Well, with your support, we passed the most significant climate law in the history of mankind—[applause]—over $370 billion.
Cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030. Launching a Climate Corps similar to AmeriCorps and Peace Corps, creating tens of thousands of jobs for young people of the future who are going to make sure this continues. Creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean energy for American workers, including the IBEW installing 500,000—500,000—charging stations all across America and, in the process, reducing carbon emissions.
And we're seeing it—we're seeing to it that the first beneficiaries of environmental initiatives are those fence-line communities that have been smothered by the legacy of pollution—in Louisiana and Delaware, Route 9—all the factories—all those chemical factories are right next to the poorest neighborhoods. They're the ones we're going to bring back.
And how—how—can we be the greatest nation in the world without the best education system in the world?
Donald Trump and the Republican friends, they not only can't think; they can't read very well. [Laughter] Seriously, think about it. Look at their Project 2025.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. They want to do away with the Department of Education.
Well, during the pandemic, Kamala and I helped States and cities get back—their schools back open, and we gave public school teachers a raise. We created apprenticeships with businesses in the communities, putting students on a path to good-paying jobs whether or not they go to college.
And by the way, we're making college a hell of a lot more affordable, increasing Pell grants by $900; over $15 billion to HBCUs—[applause]—minority-serving—including Hispanic institutions and Tribal colleges.
We kept our commitment to provide more student relief than ever by lifting the burden of [and; White House correction] helping millions of families so they could get married, start a family, buy a home, and begin to build family wealth and contribute to the community and grow our economy.
It's not costing us, it's creating more wealth.
We've fundamentally transformed how our—transformed how our economy grows: from the middle out and the bottom up instead of the top down. You know, my dad used to say, ""There wasn't a whole hell of a lot that dropped down on my kitchen table at the end of the month."" I come from a basic middle class family: three-bedroom house, four kids, a grandpop living with us; decent neighborhood, but never a penny to spare.
And look, that top-down notion never worked. A lot of Democrats didn't think it worked— thought it worked, but it doesn't.
And when we did all that, what we've done, everybody can do well—everybody.
Donald Trump calls America a failing nation.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No, I'm serious, think—but think about this. Think about this.
He publicly says to the whole world—I'm going to say something outrageous. I know more foreign leaders by their first names and know them well than anybody alive, just because I'm so damn old. [Laughter] But I'm not joking.
Think of the message he sends around the world when he talks about America being a failing nation. He says we're losing. He's the loser. He's dead wrong.
Many of you are very successful people who travel the world. Name me a country in the world that doesn't think we're the leading nation in the world. Without America—not a joke. Think about it. I'm being literal. Who could lead the world other than the United States of America?
Well, guess what? America is winning, and the world is better off for it. America is more prosperous.
In America, they're safer today than when we were under Donald Trump. Trump continues to lie about crime in America, like everything else. Guess what? On his watch, the murder rate went up 30 percent, the biggest increase in history.
Meanwhile, we made the largest investment—Kamala and I—in public safety ever. Now the murder rate is falling faster than any time in history. Violent crime has dropped to the lowest level in more than 50 years, and crime will keep coming down when we put a prosecutor in the Oval Office instead of a convicted felon.
And, folks, the distinguished Senator from—deceased Senator from California and I passed the first ban on assault weapons. And guess what? It worked. If we care about public safety, we need to prevent gun violence.
And what makes me ashamed when I travel the world, which I do: More children in America are killed by a gunshot than any other cause in the United States. More die from a bullet than cancer, accidents, or anything else in the United States of America. My God.
That's why Kamala and I are proud. We beat the NRA when we passed the first major bipartisan gun safety law in 30 years.
Audience members. Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
The President. I'm serious.
[At this point, the President put his hand over his heart.]
And that comes from here.
And now it's time to ban assault weapons again and demand universal background checks.
It's hard. I never thought I'd stand before a crowd of Democrats and refer to a President as a liar so many times. [Laughter] No, I'm not trying to be funny. It's sad.
Trump continues to lie about the border. Here's what he won't tell you: Trump killed the strongest bipartisan border deal in the history of the United States——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. ——that we negotiated with the Senate Republicans. It took 4 months—4 weeks.
Once it passed and everybody acknowledged it was the most expansive border change in American history, he called Senators to say, ""Don't support the bipartisan bill,"" because he said it would help me politically and hurt him politically.
My God. No, I'm serious. Think about it. Not a joke. Ask even the press who doesn't like me; they'll tell you that's true. [Laughter] Typically Trump, once again putting himself first and America last.
Then I had to take executive action. The result of the executive action I took: Border encounters have dropped over 50 percent. In fact, there are fewer border crossings today than when Donald Trump left office.
And unlike Trump, we will not demonize immigrants, saying they're the—""poison the blood of America""—[applause]—""poison the blood of our country."" Kamala and I are committed to strengthening legal immigration, including protecting ""Dreamers"" and more.
And here's what else I believe in: protecting your freedom: your freedom to vote, your freedom to love who you love, and your freedom to choose.
In its decision overturning Roe v. Wade, as you heard earlier tonight, the United States Supreme Court majority wrote the following. Quote, ""Women are now without electrical—with not allowed""—[inaudible]—""not without electoral—electoral""—[laughter]—""or political power."" No kidding.
MAGA Republicans found out the power of women in 2022. And Donald Trump is going to find out the power of women in 2024. [Applause] Watch.
And where Trump and his MAGA Republican right wingers seek to erase history, we Democrats continue to write history and make more history.
I'm proud—I'm proud—to have kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the United States Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, the symbol for every young woman in America that you can do anything.
I'm proud that I've kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and that it taps in to the full talent of our Nation; the most diverse Cabinet in history, including the first Black woman of South Asian descent to serve as Vice President—[applause]—and who will soon serve as the 47th President of the United States.
She is good. Look——
Audience members. Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
The President. Thank you, Kamala.
Audience members. Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!
The President. Folks, I've long said we have many obligations as a nation. But I got in trouble years ago for saying—and I make no apologies—we have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home and when they don't.
That's why I'm so proud to have written and signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans and their families exposed to toxic materials, like burn pits and Agent Orange.
I was around during the Vietnam war. It's hard when no one was able to prove that their illness was a consequence of Agent Orange. And no one was able to prove initially that because they lived in burn pits, like my son—lived next to in Iraq for a year, that it was the cause of their illness.
But because of the PACT Act, a surviving spouse with two children is now eligible for a stipend of about $3,000 a month. And those children who lost their—a parent are eligible for tuition benefits to go to college and to get job training.
It's already helping over 1 million veterans and their families just so far.
Audience member. [Inaudible]
The President. Well, I love them. And I'm so proud of my son's service.
We get it. But guess who doesn't get it and doesn't respect our veterans?
We know from his own Chief of Staff, a four-star general, John Kelly, that Trump, when in Europe, would not go to the gravesites—one of the—in France—the brave servicemembers who gave their lives to this country. He called them ""suckers"" and ""losers.""
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Who in the hell does he think he is? Who does he think he is?
Audience members. Boo!
The President. There's no words for a person—they are not the words of a person not worthy of being Commander in Chief, period. Not then, not now, and not ever. I mean that. I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
Just as no Commander in Chief should ever bow down to a dictator the way Trump bows down to Putin. I never have, and, I promise you, Kamala Harris will never do it—will never bow down.
When Trump left office, Europe and NATO was in tatters. Not a joke. ""America First"" doctrine changed our whole image in the world.
Well, I've spent—they gave the hours—about 190 hours sum total meeting with my counterparts or heads of state in Europe to strengthen NATO. We did. We united Europe like it hasn't been united for years, adding Finland and Sweden to NATO.
Ten days before he died, Henry Kissinger called and said not since Napoleon has Europe not looked over their should at Russia with dread until now—until now. Well, guess what? Putin thought he'd take Kyiv in 3 days. Three years later, Ukraine is still free.
When I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. If you haven't noticed, no one is saying that now.
And we'll keep working to bring hostages home and end the war in Gaza and bring peace and security to the Middle East.
As you know, I wrote a peace treaty for Gaza. A few days ago, I put forward a proposal that has brought us closer to doing that than we've done since October 7. We're working around the clock—my Secretary of State—to prevent a wider war and reunite hostages with their families and surge humanitarian health and food assistance into Gaza now to end the civilian suffering of the Palestinian people and finally, finally, finally deliver a cease-fire and end this war.
Those protesters out in the street, they have a point. A lot of innocent people are being killed on both sides.
Just as we worked around the clock to bring home wrongfully detained Americans and others from Russia in one of the most complicated swaps in history—but they're home— [applause]—Kamala and I are going to keep working to bring all Americans wrongfully detained around the world home. [Applause] I mean it.
Folks, I've got 5 months left in my Presidency, and I've got a lot to do. I intend to get it done.
It's the—it's been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your President. I love the job, but I love my country more. [Applause] I love my country more.
And all this talk about how I'm angry at all those people who said I should step down, it's not true.
Audience members. We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe!
The President. Thank you.
Audience members. We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe!
The President. I love my country more, and we need to preserve our democracy. In 2024, we need you to vote. We need you to keep the Senate. We need you to win back the House of Representatives. And, above all, we need you to beat Donald Trump and elect Kamala and Tim President and Vice President of the United States of America.
Look, they'll continue to lead America forward, creating more jobs, standing up for workers, growing the economy, lowering the costs for American families so they just have a little more breathing room.
We've made incredible process—progress, but we have more work to do. And Kamala and Tim will continue to take on corporate greed and bring down the cost of food.
They'll keep taking on Big Pharma, making insulin $35 a month not just for seniors, but for everyone in America, and capping prescription drug costs at a total of $2,000 not just for seniors, but for everyone. And, folks, that's going to save America, again, tens of billions of dollars.
Folks, they'll make housing more affordable, building 3 million new homes, providing $25,000 downpayment assistance for the first-time homebuyer, more than the 10 we approved.
Donald Trump wants a new tax on imported goods: food, gas, clothing, and more. You know what that will cost the average family, according to the experts? Three thousand nine hundred dollars a year in a tax.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. No, I—it's a fact.
Kamala and Tim will make the childcare tax credit permanent, lifting millions of children out of poverty and helping millions of families get ahead.
But you know what Trump has? He put the—he created the largest debt any President had in 4 years with his $2 trillion dollar tax cut for the wealthy.
Well, Trump has a new plan. He wants to provide a $5 billion tax cut for corporations and the very wealthy to put——
Audience members. Boo!
The President. ——read it—to put us further in debt.
And, folks, you know we have a thousand trillion—we have a thousand billionaires in America. You know what their average tax rate they pay? Eight-point-two percent.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. If we just increase their taxes we proposed to 25 percent, which isn't the highest tax rate even, it would raise $500 billion new dollars over 10 years, and they'd still be very wealthy.
Look, Kamala and Tim are going to make them pay their fair share. They'll protect Social Security and Medicare. Trump wants to cut Social Security and Medicare.
Kamala and Tim will protect your freedom. They'll protect your vote to right—your right to vote. They'll protect your civil rights.
And you know Trump will do everything to ban abortion nationwide.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Oh, he will.
You know Kamala and Tim will do everything they possibly can—that's why you have to elect the Senate and the House—to restore Roe v. Wade.
The ancient Greeks taught us that character is destiny. Character is destiny. For me and Jill, we know Kamala and Doug are people of character. It's been our honor to serve alongside them. And we know Tim and Gwen Walz are also people of great character.
Selecting Kamala was the very first decision I made before I became—when I became our nominee. And it was the best decision I made my whole career. We've not only gotten to know each other, we've become close friends. She's tough, she's experienced, and she has enormous integrity—enormous integrity.
Her story represents the best American story. And like many of our best Presidents, she was also Vice President. That's a joke. [Laughter]
But she'll be a President our children could look up to. She'll be a President respected by world leaders, because she already is. She'll be a President we can all be proud of. And she will be a historic President who puts her stamp on America's future.
This will be the first Presidential election since January 6. On that day, we almost lost everything about who we are as a country. And that threat—this is not hyperbole—that threat is still very much alive.
Donald Trump says he will refuse to accept the election result if he loses again.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. Think about that. He means it. Think about that.
He's promising a ""bloodbath"" if he loses, in his words, and that he'll be a dictator on ""day one,"" in his own words.
Audience members. Boo!
The President. By the way, this sucker means it. [Laughter] No, I'm not joking. Think about it. Anybody else said that in the past, you'd think he was crazy—he is crazy, but you'd think it was an exaggeration. But he means it.
We can't let that happen.
Audience members. No!
The President. Folks, all of us carry a special obligation: Independents, Republicans, Democrats. We saved democracy in 2020, and now we must save it again in 2024.
The vote each of us casts this year will determine whether democracy and freedom will prevail. It's that simple. It's that serious. And the power is literally in your hands. History is in your hands. Not hyperbole. It's in your hands. America's future is in your hands.
Let me close with this. Nowhere else in the world could a kid with a stutter and modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, grow up to sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.
That's because America is and always has been a nation of possibilities. Possibilities. We must never lose that—never. Kamala and Tim understand that this Nation must continue to be a place of possibilities not just for the few of us, but for all of us.
Join me in promising your whole heart to this effort. And where my heart will be: I promise I'll be the best volunteer Harris and Walz, this camp, have ever seen.
Each of us has a part in the American story. For me and my family, there's a song that means a lot to us that captures the best of who we are as a nation. The song is called ""American Anthem."" There's one verse that stands out, and I can't sing worth a damn, so I'm not going to try. [Laughter] I'll just quote it.
""The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day. What shall our legacy be? What will our children say? Let me know in my heart when my days are through. America, America, I gave my best to you.""
Audience members. We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe!
The President. I made—I've made a lot of mistakes in my career, but I gave my best to you. For 50 years, like many of you, I've given my heart and soul to our Nation. And I have been blessed a million times in return with the support of the American people.
I've either been the—too young to be in the Senate because I wasn't 30 yet and too old to stay as President. [Laughter] But I hope you know how grateful I am to all of you.
I can honestly say—and I mean this from the bottom—give you my word as a Biden—I can honestly say I'm more optimistic about the future than I was when I was elected as a 29-year-old United States Senator. I mean it.
Folks, we just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there is nothing we cannot do when we do it together.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you.""	Remarks at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois"

The President. Oh, it meant a lot to me. Very nice.

Representative Nancy Pelosi/The President's Decision Not To Seek Reelection 

Q. Are you angry at Nancy Pelosi? Are you going to speak with her?

The President. No, I haven't spoken to Nancy at all. I mean, look, I made—no one influenced my decision. No one knew it was coming.

What I decided to do was—I didn't want to—to the extent that the party thought they'd lose Senate seats or House seats, it just—that would have been the topic you would have had to cover the entire remainder of the campaign, and it wasn't worth it.

Q. Do you feel at peace with your choice, or do you think you still could have won?

The President. Well, you know, you always think you could have won. And if you go back and look at the numbers, we weren't that far behind. It was like we talked about how this was—we were getting blown out. That's not what we saw. But it was—it would have been close.

What have happened, though, if the discussion had been was I going to cost seats for Democrats, that would have been the whole subject matter for the remainder of the campaign. You'd have to cover it, that would be the issue, and it would give him an advantage.

Bystander. Choose life, Mr. President! Choose life while you still have time to undo some of the terrible things you've done!
The President. And, in the meantime, they want to identify the bodies. There's a lot of speculation who they are—the names. I'm not at liberty to do that until the families are notified.

We have now confirmed that one of the hostages killed by these vicious Hamas terrorists was an American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin.
I am devastated and outraged. Hersh was among the innocents brutally attacked while attending a music festival for peace in Israel on October 7. He lost his arm helping friends and strangers during Hamas' savage massacre. He had just turned 23. He planned to travel the world. I have gotten to know his parents Jon and Rachel. They have been courageous, wise, and steadfast, even as they have endured the unimaginable. They have been relentless and irrepressible champions of their son and of all the hostages held in unconscionable conditions. I admire them and grieve with them more deeply than words can express. I know all Americans tonight will have them in their prayers, just as Jill and I will. I have worked tirelessly to bring their beloved Hersh safely to them and am heartbroken by the news of his death. It is as tragic as it is reprehensible.
Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages.""	Statement on the Death of Hersh Goldberg-Polin"

"Sep 03, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-investing-america-content-series-kickoff-event-and-exchange-with-reporters,"Remarks at the ""Investing in America"" Content Series Kickoff Event and an Exchange With Reporters","""Office of Public Engagement Director Stephen K. Benjamin. Thank you all so much for being here. We're so delighted to speak to you today and to hear your stories.
It's my pleasure to start the first of what will be many conversations just like this led by our President. It's also my honor today to have the opportunity to introduce President Biden to you. He's put investing in America at the forefront of his administration since day one.
So, with that, I'd like to turn it over to our President, Joe Biden.
The President. Well, thank you, Mayor, for that introduction. And a special thanks to all of you for joining us. Mayor Woodfin, Chairwoman Flores, Cecilia, as well as Jackie, it's good to have you all. You've all been incredible partners in the progress we've made together, which, quite frankly, is why we're meeting today.
Four years ago, when I came to office, the pandemic was raging and our economy was reeling. Four years later, we still have more to do, but we had one of the most extraordinary periods of progress ever in the history of this country.
COVID no longer controls our lives. We've gone from economic crisis to the strongest economy in the world, literally: a record 16 million new jobs; record small-business growth; record stock market; record-high 401(k)s; wages are up; inflation is down—way down and continuing to come down; and the smallest racial wealth gap in 20 years.
I signed historic laws modernizing our infrastructure; bringing new chip factories back to the United States—we invented those chips; lowering prescription drug prices and lowering them significantly; fighting the climate crisis and gun violence; and so much more.
But the bottom line is, thousands of cities and towns all across America are seeing the great American comeback story—whether they're in red States or blue—all part of what we're calling an ""Invest [Investing; White House correction] in America"" agenda.
It's about seeking my commitment—speaking to the commitment I made as President to be President for all Americans, whether you voted for me or not, whether you're in a red State or a blue State. And it's what being highlighted—we're doing that today to highlight and show we're just—we're just getting started.
In the weeks ahead, I'll talk with Americans all across the country about the progress we're seeing in their communities: roads and bridges being built, lead pipes being removed from homes and schools, seniors saving significant money on prescription drug prices.
And through the ""Investing in America"" agenda, we planted the seeds for a better future, and now those seeds are finally beginning to sprout. As a result, we're on the cusp of incredible progress and prosperity for the decade to come.
That's why we're going to talk—what we're going to talk about today: the stories about people whose lives are better and the future that we can be proud of.
We're proving once again what I've always believed: We're the only nation in the world that's come out of every crisis we've faced stronger than when we entered that crisis.
We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and nothing is beyond our capacity when we do it together.
So I'm going stop there, and I'm going to turn it over to Mayor Benjamin—who I just saw recently, by the way—to get the conversation going.
And by the way, Mr. Mayor, congratulations on that beautiful young child of yours. That's really—you're a lucky man. You tell me, she's—is she already a supporter?
Mayor Randall L. Woodfin of Birmingham, Alabama. Yes, she's a supporter, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. [Laughter]
The President. Well, God love you. And—but really, God love your wife. [Laughter]
Mayor Woodfin. Yes, sir.
The President. Any rate, fire away.
Director Benjamin. Go ahead, Randall. Mayor Woodfin, go ahead and why don't you share with us your Birmingham story.
Mayor Woodfin. Well, listen, first let—would say we're very, very thankful to you, Mr. President, and the—and your entire administration, which has allowed us as a city and a government to truly focus on putting people first.
You know, over the last 4 years, as you stated, there has been an upswing. For us, wages, income, and employment have been on the rise in Birmingham. The average income has increased by more than $10,000, and we've exceeded prepandemic employment by over 17,000 jobs.
So Birmingham is seeing job creation. We're seeing growth in innovative industries and opportunity. And I can say, without a doubt, that that is directly related to the Biden administration and your investments and support.
We're also tracking along national trends as it relates to small-business growth and expansion. We even created an Office of Business Diversity and Opportunity to be intentionally focused on minority- and women-owned businesses.
And so, again, thank you to your administration. Our ARPA investment has stood up a COVID-relief forgivable loan program, where literally 9 out of every 10 recipients was either a Black- or woman-owned business.
And so, again, driving what your administration has allowed us to accomplish, designating—city of Birmingham being allowed to be designated as a tech hub has strengthened our recruitment efforts related to enhancing our innovation economy.
There are a couple other notes I want to make. One is that as part of your administration's Good Job Challenge, we are training and placing up to 1,000 residents in health care careers.
In addition to that, as the State of Alabama is the epicenter of the automotive industry, we're seeing a boost because of your Inflation Reduction Act. And because of those same investments in electric and batteries. In 2023, Alabama became the number-one exporter of motor vehicles in the U.S., which we shipped more than 11 billion in automotive—automotobiles [automobiles; White House correction].
These investments, Mr. President, helped us train workers right here in the city limits of Birmingham for more advanced manufacturing jobs.
So it doesn't matter—through small businesses, clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and health care, our residents see more and more that they don't have to leave their hometown, their city limits to get a good job, because they can get one right here.
And for us, in closing, that really means that the people of Birmingham are excited: excited for a brighter future; excited to see themselves in it, their families; and, for us, a great city. So we truly thank you.
The President. Well, Mayor, tell me, you know, up in North Birmingham, which is, I think, primarily a minority community, what are you doing up there to revitalize things?
Mayor Woodfin. So, North Birmingham, first of all, it's kind of personal to me. I actually spent my first 11 years of life living in North Birmingham and went to North Birmingham Elementary.
But this area has been historically disadvantaged. It is 100-percent minority—Black. We're talking about low employment, as well as fewer resources for its residents. And so we are so excited to receive a $20 million grant as part of the Distressed Area Recompete Pilot Program for this area.
And so, in this North Birmingham footprint, it is going to allow us to catalyze economic growth. We call it Reinvest Birmingham. This initiative—a little bit more detail—will allow us to rebuild something that's so important to all communities, our North Birmingham Library. And at this actual place, it affords us to create opportunity for learning and careers, as well as seeing a new workforce training site connected to this library for investments in entrepreneurship.
And my favorite part, because it's part of the national conversation, it is a childcare facility. Look——
The President. All right.
Mayor Woodfin. So that's it, Mr. President. It's a—it's a game changer for us.
Director Benjamin. Fantastic.
The President. Well, I tell you what, I can see Frederick Douglass's book behind you. He's proud of you right now and your library.
Well, look——
Mayor Woodfin. [Laughter] Yes, sir.
The President. Boss.
Director Benjamin. Sure. So thank you so much, Mayor Woodfin, for your leadership.
Now I have the chance to call on Ms. Jackie Trapp from Muskego, Wisconsin, to share her story with the president.
Muskego, WI, resident Jackie Trapp. Thank you, Mr. Mayor and Mr. President. I'm Jackie Trapp, a former social studies teacher turned family caregiver. And in 2015, I was diagnosed with an incurable cancer, multiple myeloma. 
Both the cancer and the chemotherapy caused blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes, so I'll likely be on the critical blood thinner Xarelto for the rest of my life. The new negotiated price of Xarelto, because of the Inflation Reduction Act, is a tremendous win for countless patients like me who rely on this previously cost-prohibitive medication to live.
Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act, my out-of-pocket drug costs ranged from $15- to over $21,000 a year every year for 9 years. My energy to fight my cancer was diverted to finding ways to fund my prescriptions. It became my latest occupation, really.
Director Benjamin. Wow.
[At this point, the President coughed.]
The President. Excuse me.
Ms. Trapp. But on New Year's Day, when everybody was ringing in the New Year, I actually celebrated my first fill of prescriptions, knowing that the $3,300 I paid was going to be my total for the year.
In 2025, that cap drops to $2,000, and I won't have to come up with tens of thousands of dollars every year anymore for my medication.
Before the Inflation Reduction Act, my husband and I used our savings; I navigated grants, took out home loans; we sold vehicles; and we sold furnishings and cut out all but the essentials just to meet my copays. Ordinary things like dinner out, catching a movie, or exchanging gifts had pretty much ceased, and I thought no one would ever take on Big Pharma as they held patients like me hostage with monopolies over my essential drugs.
So I cannot overstate my gratitude for this law, especially to you, President Biden. Thank you so, so much for looking out for patients like me.
The President. I have one important question. What's your dog's name?
Ms. Trapp. [Laughter] My dog is Jake.
The President. Jake. [Laughter] Well, I tell you what——
Ms. Trapp. Jake, the dog.
The President. Look, you know, I want people to understand that I've been having this run-in with Big Pharma for a long time. We finally beat them.
And the Xarelto you're taking—were—taking, it used to cost $517. It's now $197 for people on Medicare. And the idea that you were paying as much—I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act, $2,000 out-of-pocket annual cap for Medicare prescription drugs. And it's just got to be a life-changer.
You know, the mental impact of having to figure, ""If I don't take these drugs, my life is literally at stake,"" and having to figure out, ""How in God's name—how in God's name—can we get the money to do it?""
I'm so proud of you. Presumptuous of me to say that; I've never met you personally. [Laughter] But I really am. I'm proud as hell of you.
Ms. Trapp. Thank you.
The President. You're just a real fighter, and you look great. I hope it's—I hope you feel as good as you look.
Ms. Trapp. Well, I am so grateful. I can't even overstate that. Really, thank you. This opportunity to thank you means quite a bit to me.
The President. Well, all of you got to come to the White—I'm not going to be in the White House much longer, but you've got to come and see me. I want to see you all.
Ms. Trapp. [Inaudible] [Laughter]
The President. All right? Well, Mr. Mayor.
Director Benjamin. Well, we'll get—we'll figure that out, boss. We'll figure that out. [Laughter] Thank you so much for your courage, Ms. Trapp, and—and keep on fighting.
Ms. Trapp. Thank you.
Director Benjamin. Now I have the honor of calling on Chairwoman Amelia Flores to share her story. Madam Chair.
Chairwoman Amelia Flores of the Colorado River Indian Tribes. Kwichkamaduum, Mr. President. It's an honor to be here with you today. My name is Amelia Flores, and I am the Chairwoman of the Colorado River Indian Tribes, also known as CRIT. And I'm very proud to be the first woman elected to lead our Tribe. We broke the glass ceiling on December 5, 2020.
And I've seen firsthand how poor infrastructure—be it water, schools, broadband, our roads—has impacted my Tribe.
For an example, during my first few months on the job, our Tribal utility director came to me with some bad news: We did—we needed a new well. And I knew our Tribal budget was already taxed to the breaking point, and there was no way we could have pulled this off until you passed the ARPA and bipartisan infrastructure law.
ARPA helped us fix the broken well, and BIL provided more than $7 million to build new wells and improve our distribution system.
Phase one is completed. The well is once again serving 1,850 homes and businesses. And when we complete phase two, the new well and distribution system will be able to deliver safe and reliable water to more than 1,000 additional homes and businesses in our community.
This project will allow us to address the housing shortage on our reservation. That means more families can live together on our Tribal land. It helps our businesses and our economy grow. Together, that strengthens our culture and, most importantly, our sovereignty.
The well and water treatment plant will have a long-term impact in our community, and I am grateful for your leadership in making that all happen, Mr. President.
The President. Well, I'm grateful to you. And by the way, I learned a long time ago from a friend of mine from Hawaii, a senior Senator when I got elected as a—30-year-old kid to the Senate. He said: ""Joe, it's Indian Nations. Indian Nations."" And that's exactly how you're handling it. That's how it's treated. And the sovereignty is real. And you need the help. You need the help.
And I—let me ask you a question, Chairwoman.
Chairwoman Flores. Sure.
The President. How are these investments helping your community see a brighter future for themselves and their families? Is there anything just beyond the water? Is it the mere fact that the water is there; that's why everybody's excited? Or it's that you're able to begin to fashion your own destiny a little bit?
Chairwoman Flores. Well, thank you, Mr. President, for that question. And certainly, with the monies that have come from ARPA and the bipartisan law, it allows for more people to return back to the reservation, because many of our Tribal members leave the reservation to find work. And when they leave, they oftentimes take their families with them.
And then eventually, 20, 30 years after, they want to come back home, and that's hard because we don't have the housing or the infrastructure for them to come back. And we haven't been able to do that for them.
So, with this project, with the new wells and upcoming water treatment system, we will have cleaner and safer water. We now have the infrastructure we need to build for housing for our people, and we can build up our community. We'll have more families here, and that really changes things up for us and gives us hope.
And yes, we're the Tribes with the water. We have senior water rights on the Lower Colorado River Basin. And we have the largest water right.
Thank you.
The President. I know you do, and it's about time everybody recognized it.
And we just had a photograph up on the other board here while you were talking about how beautiful the countryside is. It's a magnificent area.
So thank you, and you're doing a great job. Thank you very much.
Ms. Flores. Thank you. Thank you, and God bless you.
The President. Thank you.
Director Benjamin. Thank you.
Well, now it's our honor, we have Ms. Cecilia Moy Yep from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, here to share her story. Please, Ms. Moy Yep. Please.
Philadelphia, PA, resident Cecilia Moy Yep. Thank you. My name is Cecilia Moy Yep. In 1966, I was a widow with three small children living in Chinatown, Philadelphia. I was at a public meeting when I found out that the church and school my children went to was going to be demolished for a Federal highway program.
The church was the heart and lifeblood of the community, so I got involved. I formed a grassroots organization to fight against the highway. We organized. We picketed. We protested. But we did have some success because we were successful in protecting the school and the church from being demolished.
But despite our efforts, the Vine Street Expressway was still built through the heart of Chinatown. And even over the years, many of my neighbors and I were forced out of our houses because of other transportation projects.
The Vine Street Expressway created a physical divide that made Chinatown less safe. It made our air quality worse. The construction displaced so many people from our community. But from the very beginning, we tried to get the highway capped to improve safety and to reconnect Chinatown, but there was never funding to make it happen.
But now, after 50 years of organizing, thanks to you and your administration for their investment in the Chinatown Stitch project, this dream will finally become a reality.
Our community has been asking for this for decades, and it would never have happened without your funding. Thank you so much for delivering, Mr. President, for our community.
The President. Cecilia, I know your community pretty well. I live down the road in Delaware. [Laughter] And I-95 went through my community, and it—not where I live, but in West—the western part of the city. And it divided entire communities. It's four lanes across, and we've been fighting for a long time. We finally got commitments—we got the money.
For example, you're going to get—you're going to share a now $159 million—$159 million—from the Inflation Reduction Act. And the China [Chinatown; White House correction] Stitch project is going to reconnect Philadelphia Chinatown, which was divided in construction back in the sixties with the Vine Street Expressway.
Ms. Yep. Yes.
The President. That project will cover 2.5 blocks of expressway with public green space, achieving the goal that you've been fighting for for nearly 60 years.
I know you're only 62 years old, but you've been fighting a long time.
Ms. Yep. I wish. I wish. [Laughter]
The President. The Department of Transportation experts are—signed a grant agreement in January. The project is going to take a while to get done, but it will—we expect it to begin full born—full blown in 2028 and be completed by—in early '31. So it's going to take a little time, but it's going to be complete. It's going to be done. The money is there and——
Ms. Yep. I hope I'm still alive to see it. [Laughter]
The President. You'll be alive. You'll be—God love you.
Ms. Yep. But it's something the—yes, it's something the community has wanted for a long, long time. And this will give our community, families, and children the peace of mind knowing that people can be safe going to school and to work.
It means a lot to know that the Federal Government listened to us and is helping us to build a brighter future for families right here in Chinatown.
The President. Well, all——
Ms. Yep. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. All over the country, we're doing this.
And by the way, there's a photograph of you with a shovel in your hand—[laughter]—up on the board here and a hard hat on, celebrating the turn of the spade to this getting going. And what I don't want you to do: I don't want you working beyond 5 o'clock at night, though. Okay? [Laughter] You've got to promise me you'll be home. [Laughter]
Ms. Yep. That's hard, because when you're doing community work, it's always at night.
The President. I—that's true. Well, God love you.
Ms. Yep. Thank you.
The President. Cecilia, I'm so, so proud of you.
Ms. Yep. Thank you.
The President. I really am so proud of you. Presumptuous of me to say that, but I am.
Well, thank you all very much. This just—all the families deserve to have things that we shared today, not just the four and their community: peace of mind, having clean and safe water, affordable medicine to stay healthy, safe roads and bridges to connect communities rather than divide them, and so much more.
All Americans deserve a future worthy of their dreams. And that future, we're building today. And we're doing it, and we're able to afford to do it. Turning setbacks into comebacks, that's what America does.
And I want to thank you for what you're doing. And I'm excited—excited—about sharing your investment stories with all of America, seeing more of them in the weeks and months ahead to let people know we can do anything in America. We really can.
And we can afford to do it. Instead of giving billion-dollar tax—trillion-dollar tax cuts to the superwealthy, let them start paying their fair share. Let them make sure we get—make—look, all people want in America is just a shot, just a chance, just to be treated fairly and equally.
And that's what you all are doing. That's what you're all a part of. And I hope I get to see you all in person one of these days. So thank you, thank you, thank you.
God bless you all.
Ms. Yep. Thank you, Mr. President.
The President. Thank you.
May God protect our troops.

"Sep 11, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-death-aysenur-ezgi-eygi,Statement on the Death of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi,"""I am outraged and deeply saddened by the death of Aysenur Eygi. Aysenur was a recent U.S. college graduate. She was also an activist whose idealism led her to travel to the West Bank to peacefully protest the expansion of settlements. The shooting that led to her death is totally unacceptable.
Israel has acknowledged its responsibility for Aysenur's death, and a preliminary investigation has indicated that it was the result of a tragic error resulting from an unnecessary escalation. The U.S. Government has had full access to Israel's preliminary investigation and expects continued access as the investigation continues so that we can have confidence in the result. We will continue to stay in close contact with Israeli and Palestinian authorities regarding the circumstances that led to Aysenur's death.
There must be full accountability. And Israel must do more to ensure that incidents like this never happen again.
The violence in the West Bank has been going on for too long. Violent extremist Israeli settlers are uprooting Palestinians from their homes. Palestinian terrorists are sending car bombs to kill civilians. I will continue to support policies that hold all extremists—Israelis and Palestinians alike—accountable for stoking violence and serving as obstacles to peace.""

"Sep 12, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-30th-anniversary-the-violence-against-women-act,Remarks on the 30th Anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act,"""My name is Joe Biden. [Laughter] I'm Jill Biden's husband and Ashley Biden's dad.
Thank you, Ruth, Nicole, and Kyle for sharing your stories. Your courage literally inspires the Nation, and we stand with you. The entire Nation stands with you.
You know, my daughter Ashley—the love of my life and the life of my love—she is—she—and anyway, I don't get—anyway. [Laughter]. I get emotional when I talk about her.
And thank you, Ada, and your beautiful poetry.
It's also an honor to see so many friends, brave survivors, and devoted advocates.
And thank you to the bipartisan Members of Congress who have worked tirelessly—and I mean tirelessly—to ensure and expand what we're doing here today, as well as the—[applause]. The reason I put these glasses on, the sun is shining that way, and I want to see you all over there. [Laughter]
As well as the late Dianne Feinstein and Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, whom we miss very much.
It wasn't too long ago that we as a country didn't want to talk about violence against women as a national epidemic, let alone do something the Government had to address. Society often looked away.
In so many—so many—places, violence against women wasn't a crime; it was referred to as a ""family affair."" We were told addressing it would cause disintegration of the family. That's what I got accused of: ""Biden was disintegrating the family."" Not a joke. That was a full-blown campaign.
And that shelters—this is the one that really angered me—shelters that we were putting in place were nothing more than ""indoctrination centers""—indoctrination; few police—few police—departments had special victims units; and there was no national hotline to call—none.
There was a background—that was the background when I first wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1990. My goal was to do more than change the law: to change the culture of America—I mean it; to provide more protection and support for survivors; and to create accountability for perpetrators.
The way I looked at it—I come from—I was raised by a dad—a gentle, decent man. He taught my siblings and me that the greatest abuse of power—the greatest abuse of power was to abuse power. And the cardinal sin that a man could do was raise his hand to a woman or a child.
So I believed that the only way we could change the culture was by shining a light on that culture and speaking its name. We started holding public hearings, despite Senators saying it was—I was—it was too salacious for the public to see. That was one of the arguments: ""You may be right, Joe, but it's too salacious for the public to see. They won't understand.""
We had to let America know what was going on. Americans, at our core, are basic, decent people, and I believed that if they could see the truth, we could begin to change things. And that's what happened.
The Violence Against Women Act broke the dam of congressional and cultural resistance, brought this hidden epidemic out of the shadows, and began to shift the legal and social burdens away from the survivors onto the perpetrators where they belonged.
For example, the new law created the first-ever national hotline for survivors to get help. It supported shelters, rape crisis centers, housing, legal assistance for women and children all across America. And the law helped train police officers and advocates and prosecutors and judges and court personnel to make our entire system—entire system—more fair and responsible to the needs of survivors.
And over the last 30 years, every time we've reauthorized that law—when I was Senator, when I was Vice President, when I was President—we've strengthened it. We've broadened the law's domestic violence protections, to including dating violence and to better support survivors of stalking and sexual assault. We expanded services to protect immigrants, communities of color, rural communities, Tribal lands, LGBTQ survivors.
And to create a new program to end the backlog of rape kits, instead of prevention programs in every State, we secured historic funding to increase so much more.
Since we passed VAWA, according to the Department of Justice, between 1993 and 2022, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by almost 70 percent, while rape and sexual assaults have declined by more than 55 percent.
And our first-ever Domestic Violence Hotline has received over 7 million calls since 1996. It matters. It saves lives, being able to pick up that phone and call. I remember the first time I listened in. ""I can hear him. I can see him. He's coming. Please, send somebody. Please, please, please.""
You know, but there's always more to do. Let me just say, the first and best decision I made when I was the nominee in 2020 was selecting Kamala Harris as Vice President—not a political statement; it's a factual statement—a former district attorney, attorney general, U.S. Senator, who has prosecuted and stood up to sexual violence offenders her entire career.
You can't say that about my predecessor. [Laughter]
Kamala and I have also taken steps beyond this law to address violence against women. We know that during the pandemic—and you know it as well—domestic violence increased.
That's why, through our American Rescue Plan, I directed $1 billion in supplemental funding to ensure survivors trapped in bad situations could get the port [support; White House correction], including safe housing.
We also passed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years that narrowed—[applause]—that narrowed the so-called ""boyfriend loophole"" to include dating partners convicted of abuse who say they could not own a firearm. What a fight that was, but we won it.
I signed a bipartisan bill to end what's known as forced arbitration. Remember that? We hire you. If in fact you—anything happened, you—where you—it has to go to arbitration and not—you can't go to court. It prevented survivors of abuse and harassment in the workplace from getting their day in court. We ended that.
It was amazing, the people who opposed us doing that. That just stunned me.
And to keep college students safe, we sent the—we strengthened the protections under title IX that my predecessor then weakened. And building on the work we started when I was Vice President, when I launched the ""It's On Us"" program that Kyle mentioned earlier, we're increasing funding—increasing funding—to prevent campus assault—sexual assault. It's important.
And we've created reforms that fundamentally shift how the military investigates and prosecutes sexual assault and domestic violence, including—including—independent prosecutors who now report outside the military officer command structure.
And I want to thank Kirsten—Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Congresswoman Jackie Speier. Is Jackie here? I know Kirsten couldn't be here. And, Jackie, if you're here, stand up, because you deserve special recognition. I don't see you, but you may be out there. [Laughter] Jackie's leadership on this has made a big difference.
For the first time in nearly a decade, the rates of sexual assault and harassment within the Active Duty military forces are down, finally—down.
Kamala and I also continue to stand with women and girls worldwide who are facing violence and demand basic human rights. I also signed the historic Presidential memorandum to punish individuals around the globe who use rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war and terror.
And we continue to condemn Russia for its widespread violent sexual assaults in Ukraine, just as we condemned the terrorist group Hamas and its appalling, despicable acts of rape, mutilation, sexual violence in Israel on October 7 and against hostages in captivity.
Silence and denial can hide much, but it can erase nothing—nothing. Some injuries are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous, they can't be buried, no matter how hard people try.
And today I'm proud to announce a new significant actions: a record of nearly $700 million in grants this year alone to more than 40 VA—VAWA-funded programs in States, Tribal communities, and across the country—$700 million.
We're also issuing new policies to expand housing protections for survivors, give law enforcement more tools to remove guns from domestic abusers, and we are—we are tackling the next frontier of gender-based violence and abuse: deep-fake images and videos generated by artificial intelligence.
Back in 2022, we established civil protections for those who—whose imminent—whose intimate images are shared without their consent. It's now a crime.
Today, in response to my call to action, we have received new commitments from leading technology companies to combat the creation of exploitive deep-fake images and to stop distributing and making money off this kind of sexual abuse, which they're doing now.
Folks, but the fact is, we know our work never stops. To any survivor who is struggling, I want you to know you're not alone. Doug [Jill; White House correction] and I, Kamala and Doug, and our entire administration and entire community have your back.
For example, Kamala and I will continue to defend reproductive freedom in America. My predecessor is proud that he put Justices on the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. As a result, Republicans are criminalizing doctors, denying IVF treatment, turning women away from emergency room, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their States to get care. It is outrageous.
In its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote, and I quote, ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" End of quote. No kidding. [Laughter] No kidding. Talk about out of touch. [Laughter] Clearly, the Supreme Court and my predecessors have no clue about the power of women in America.
Let me close with this. The Violence Against Women Act is my proudest legislative accomplishment in all the years I've served as Senator, Vice President, and President. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. [Applause]
Thank you. Thank—and I'm so proud, so grateful for the heroes—the heroes I've met along the way, standing up here on these Capitol steps, who are here today and across the country: women and men who run shelters and rape crisis centers; fighters and allies who stand up to industry titans to expose the truth; survivors who speak up for themselves and empower those suffering in silence.
You've changed the Nation. You've turned your pain into purpose. And your bravery and your spirit are unbreakable. And because of you—and this is not hyperbole—because of you, we're a better nation than we were 30 years ago.
By the way, my daughter is a social worker in Philadelphia, providing housing for abused women and those coming out of prison. She was going to be here today, but she's ill. She was going to introduce me.
I want to thank her and all like her. You all are the reason why—and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I hear about what a terrible nation—I'm an—optimistic about our Nation. I've never been more optimistic about our future. I really haven't.
We just have—we have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we do it together.
We're the only nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in. And we're going to continue to fight and end all this scourge that we had to deal with.
God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
Thank you, thank you, thank you."""

Mr. President, what do you say to Vladimir Putin's threat of war?
President Biden. I say to you: Be quiet until I speak. Okay? That's what I say. Good idea?
Q. Well, what do you say to Vladimir Putin's—
Q. Sir——
Q. ——threat of war, sir? It's a serious threat.
President Biden. Well, I—well, I—you've got to be quiet, and I'm going to make a statement here. Okay?
All right. Anyway.
Mr. Prime Minister, welcome. Welcome back to the White House.
Often said there's no issue of global consequence where the United States and Great Britain can't work together and haven't worked together. And we're going to discuss some of these things right now.
You—first, Ukraine. I want to thank you for the U.K.'s leadership on this front. The United States is committed to standing with you to help Ukraine as it defends against Russia's onslaught and aggression and clear that Putin will not—make it clear Putin will not prevail in this war and the people of Ukraine will prevail.
Second, the Middle East.
Prime Minister Starmer. Yes.
President Biden. Today we'll discuss our work to secure a deal in the Middle East to release the remaining hostages that are held—being held by Hamas, bring an immediate cease-fire, increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza.
And thirdly, we're going to be talking about the Indo-Pacific. No region more important to our future. And I'm so proud that under our AUKUS partnership with Australia and—with Australia the last 3 years, we've made the region more free, open, and secure.
So, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you again for being here. And I look forward to our conversation.
Prime Minister Starmer. Mr. President, thank you very much for those words. Thank you for the invitation to be back here just 2 months after our last meeting here.
And it's really important to us—great allies, that special relationship—to have this time to talk about the global issues you have just identified, starting, of course, with Ukraine, where I think the next few weeks and months could be crucial. Very, very important that we support Ukraine in this vital war of freedom. And so I look forward to discussing that with you.
The Middle East, of course, again, vital over the coming weeks and months. And elsewhere in the world.
I think that, historically, we've shown the strength of our relationship, that we are strategically aligned, we have common cause on these global issues. And therefore, it's very important us—for us to have this opportunity to talk them through, not just as a matter of tactics, but also the wider strategy that underpins them.
So thank you for the invitation. It's very good to be here again.
President Biden. Good to have you back.
President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia 
Q. What do you say to Vladimir Putin's threat of war, Mr. President?
President Biden. I don't think much about Vladimir Putin.
Q. Mr.—Mr. President——
Q. Do you take that threat seriously?
Ukraine/Russia 
Q. ——can you tell us, sir: How close are you to agreeing to have missiles go into deeper Russia? How close are you to that decision?
[At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.]
President Biden. We're going to discuss that now.
[Several reporters began speaking at once. President Biden gave a thumbs up.]""	Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the United Kingdom and an Exchange With Reporters"
"Sep 20, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-cabinet-meeting-and-exchange-with-reporters-10,Remarks Prior to a Cabinet Meeting and an Exchange With Reporters,"""The President. Well, good morning. I guess it's still morning, isn't it? Yes.
Before I begin this Cabinet meeting, I want to discuss very briefly the need for Congress to pass a continuing resolution. It's critical. And we have 10 days for Congress to pass a short-term funding bill that gives them more time to deliver on our national defense, veterans, hard-working families—what we've already appropriated. It's important we get it done.
And it's the only path forward, by—it's by working across the aisle. We've got to have faith that our leaders will pull this together. It's really important. It's a—and—to fund the Government.
And so this Cabinet meeting comes at a time when we have 4 months left in the administration. And we're going to keep running through the tape because the Vice President and I are determined to keep making sure that the democracy delivers what the American people are asking for and what we provided.
That means continuing to implement the historic laws we've passed. They've allowed us to invest in America, rebuild our infrastructure, and implement our historic laws.
So we're grateful that Jill is here today. [Laughter] I heard that clapping—it wasn't for me—when we came in.
And here, across previous administrations, First Ladies have attended these meetings and on—for specific reasons. It's the first time Jill has joined us. And it goes to show how important the issue is, what she's about to speak to, to both of us.
Today, at the top of our meeting, Jill is going to give an update on the House initiative—White House initiative to fundamentally change the approach and fund—on how we approach and fund women's health services.
So I'd like to turn it over to Jill and—for any comments she has.
The First Lady. Thanks, Joe.
The President. And it's all yours, kid.
The First Lady. Thank you.
You know, sometimes the White House surprises you. When Joe became President, I knew I wanted to keep shining a light on the issues that I'd worked on for so many years: supporting military and veteran families, ending cancer as we know it with the Biden Cancer Moonshot, lifting up educators, and promoting free community college as a pathway to good-paying careers.
But then last year, I learned about—more about gaps—huge gaps in our understanding of women's health. Our Nation is home to the best health research in the world, yet women's health is understudied, and research is underfunded. And we still know too little about how to effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat a range of health conditions in women, from heart disease to cancers.
It was one of those moments where you can never see the world the same way again. And I knew that I had to add this to my portfolio.
So, last November, Joe and I launched the first-ever White House Initiative on Women's Health Research. And what has never surprised me about the White House is that when you have a great team, which Joe has in all of you, you can bring about solutions quickly.
I'm here, my first time at a Cabinet meeting, to thank you for the incredible progress we've made on women's health research, all in less than a year. Joe directed Federal departments and agencies to prioritize women's health research and innovation, and you responded.
In February, ARPA-H, the agency Joe created to pursue breakthrough health research, at lightning speed, launched its first-ever Sprint for Women's Health. The $100 million investment will fund innovations that will be life changing for women.
Then, a month later, NIH committed another $200 million to fund interdisciplinary women's health research, for example, looking at how menopause affects heart health, brain health, and bone health.
In May, the Department of Defense and the VA launched a new joint effort to improve research for women in the military and for women veterans.
On Monday, I'll be at the Clinton Global Initiative to make a new announcement, and we will share more then.
In June, the Department of Health and Human Services announced new funding to address the unique mental health and substance use treatment needs of women.
Your agencies are strengthening standards so that when the Government funds research, it includes women from the beginning. That means making sure women are enrolled in clinical trials and that researchers design studies, analyze data, and report finding [findings; White House correction] in ways that improve women's health.
Joe's Executive order directed the most comprehensive set of actions that any President has ever taken to advance women's health research. And, in his State of the Union Address, he asked Congress for $12 billion to secure the bold and transformative health discoveries we need.
Our White House initiative has built momentum for health research focused on women, but we have to keep moving forward. We have to keep working across Government and the private sector to incentivize innovative health research for women.
It's time to write a new story of health care in this country, one where women get the answers we need, where the United States continues to be home to the most cutting-edge research in the world, and where everyone can lead healthier lives.
Thank you.
[At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.]
Q. Mr. President, is it realistic to get to a cease-fire?
Hamas-Israel Conflict in Gaza, Palestinian Territories/Lebanon 
Q. Mr. President, what do—[inaudible]?
[Several reporters spoke at once.]
The President. On the peace process, we're continuing to try to do what we've tried from the beginning to make sure that both the people in northern Israel as well as southern Lebanon are able to go back to their homes and go back safely. And the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, our whole team is working—the intelligence community—to try to get that done. And we're going to keep at it until we get it done. But we've got a way to go.
[Several reporters spoke at once.]
Q. Is it realistic?
[Several reporters spoke at once.]
The President. Shh. Hey.
Middle East/U.S. Diplomatic Efforts 
Q. Is it realistic to get to a cease-fire deal, or have too many bad things happened that make it difficult?
The President. If I ever said it's not realistic, we might as well leave. A lot of things don't look realistic until we get them done. We have to keep at it.
Thank you."""
"Sep 21, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-australia-prime-minister-1,"Joint Statement by President Biden, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India—The Wilmington Declaration","""Today, we—Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan, and President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States—met for the fourth in-person Quad Leaders Summit, hosted by President Biden in Wilmington, Delaware.
Four years since elevating the Quad to a leader-level format, the Quad is more strategically aligned than ever before and is a force for good that delivers real, positive, and enduring impact for the Indo-Pacific. We celebrate the fact that over just four years, Quad countries have built a vital and enduring regional grouping that will buttress the Indo-Pacific for decades to come.
Anchored by shared values, we seek to uphold the international order based on the rule of law. Together we represent nearly two billion people and over one-third of global gross domestic product. We reaffirm our steadfast commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient. Through our cooperation, the Quad is harnessing all of our collective strengths and resources, from governments to the private sector to people-to-people relationships, to support the region's sustainable development, stability, and prosperity by delivering tangible benefits to the people of the Indo-Pacific.
As four leading maritime democracies in the Indo-Pacific, we unequivocally stand for the maintenance of peace and stability across this dynamic region, as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity. We strongly oppose any destabilizing or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion. We condemn recent illicit missile launches in the region that violate UN Security Council resolutions. We express serious concern over recent dangerous and aggressive actions in the maritime domain. We seek a region where no country dominates and no country is dominated—one where all countries are free from coercion, and can exercise their agency to determine their futures. We are united in our commitment to upholding a stable and open international system, with its strong support for human rights, the principle of freedom, rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and peaceful settlement of disputes and prohibition on the threat or use of force in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter.
Reflecting the Vision Statement issued by Leaders at the 2023 Quad Summit, we are and will continue to be transparent in what we do. Respect for the leadership of regional institutions, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), is and will remain at the center of the Quad's efforts.
A Global Force for Good 
Health Security 
The COVID-19 pandemic reminded the world how important health security is to our societies, our economies, and the stability of our region. In 2021 and 2022, the Quad came together to deliver more than 400 million safe and effective COVID-19 doses to Indo-Pacific countries and almost 800 million vaccines globally, and provided $5.6 billion to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment for vaccine supply to low and middle-income countries. In 2023, we announced the Quad Health Security Partnership, through which the Quad continues to deliver for partners across the region, including through the delivery of pandemic preparedness training.
In response to the current clade I mpox outbreak, as well as the ongoing clade II mpox outbreak, we plan to coordinate our efforts to promote equitable access to safe, effective, quality-assured mpox vaccines, including where appropriate expanding vaccine manufacturing in low and middle-income countries.
Today we are proud to announce the Quad Cancer Moonshot, a groundbreaking partnership to save lives in the Indo-Pacific region. Building on the Quad's successful partnership during the COVID-19 pandemic, our collective investments to address cancer in the region, our scientific and medical capabilities, and contributions from our private and non-profit sectors, we will collaborate with partner nations to reduce the burden of cancer in the region.
The Quad Cancer Moonshot will focus initially on combatting cervical cancer—a preventable cancer that continues to claim too many lives—in the Indo-Pacific region, while laying the groundwork to address other forms of cancer as well. The United States intends to support this initiative, including through U.S. Navy medical trainings and professional exchanges around cervical cancer prevention in the region starting in 2025, and through U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) openness to finance eligible private sector-driven projects to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer, including cervical cancer. Australia is announcing the expansion of the Elimination Partnership in the Indo-Pacific for Cervical Cancer Program (EPICC) with support of the Australian Government and the Minderoo Foundation to AUD 29.6 million, to cover up to eleven countries in the Indo-Pacific in helping advance the elimination of cervical cancer and support complementary initiatives focused on cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. India commits to providing HPV sampling kits, detection kits, and cervical cancer vaccines worth $7.5 million to the Indo-Pacific region. India, through its $10 million commitment to the WHO's Global Initiative on Digital Health, will offer technical assistance to interested countries in the Indo-Pacific region for the adoption and deployment of its Digital Public Infrastructure that helps in cancer screening and care. Japan is providing medical equipment, including CT and MRI scanners, and other assistance worth approximately $27 million, including in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Timor-Leste, and is contributing to international organizations such as the Gavi Vaccine Alliance. Quad partners also intend to work, within respective national contexts, to collaborate in advancing research and development in the area of cancer and to increase private sector and non-governmental sector activities in support of reducing the burden of cervical cancer in the region. We welcome a number of new, ambitious commitments from non-governmental institutions, including the Serum Institute of India, in partnership with Gavi, which will support orders of up to 40 million HPV vaccine doses, subject to necessary approvals, for the Indo-Pacific region, and which may be increased consistent with demand. We also welcome a new $100 million commitment from Women's Health and Empowerment Network to address cervical cancer in Southeast Asia.
Altogether, our scientific experts assess that the Quad Cancer Moonshot will save hundreds of thousands of lives over the coming decades.
Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) 
Twenty years since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, when the Quad first came together to surge humanitarian assistance, we continue to respond to the vulnerabilities caused by natural disasters in the Indo-Pacific. In 2022, the Quad established the ""Quad Partnership on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief in the Indo-Pacific"" and signed Guidelines for the Quad Partnership on HADR in the Indo-Pacific, which enable Quad countries to rapidly coordinate in the face of natural disasters. We welcome Quad governments working to ensure readiness to rapidly respond, including through pre-positioning of essential relief supplies, in the event of a natural disaster; this effort extends from the Indian Ocean region, to Southeast Asia, to the Pacific.
In May 2024, following a tragic landslide in Papua New Guinea, Quad partners collectively contributed over $5 million in humanitarian assistance. Quad partners are working together to provide over $4 million in humanitarian assistance to support the people of Vietnam in light of the devastating consequences of Typhoon Yagi. The Quad continues to support partners in the region in their longer-term resiliency efforts.
Maritime Security 
In 2022, we announced the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) to offer near-real-time, integrated, and cost-effective maritime domain awareness information to partners in the region. Since then, in consultation with partners, we have successfully scaled the program across the Indo-Pacific region—through the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, with partners in Southeast Asia, to the Information Fusion Center—Indian Ocean Region, Gurugram. In doing so, the Quad has helped well over two dozen countries access dark vessel maritime domain awareness data, so they can better monitor the activities in their exclusive economic zones—including unlawful activity. Australia commits to boosting its cooperation with the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency to enhance regional maritime domain awareness in the Pacific through satellite data, training, and capacity building.
Today we are announcing a new regional Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI), to enable our partners in the region to maximize tools provided through IPMDA and other Quad partner initiatives, to monitor and secure their waters, enforce their laws, and deter unlawful behavior. We look forward to India hosting the inaugural MAITRI workshop in 2025. Furthermore, we welcome the launch of a Quad maritime legal dialogue to support efforts to uphold the rules-based maritime order in the Indo-Pacific. In addition, Quad partners intend to layer new technology and data into IPMDA over the coming year, to continue to deliver cutting edge capability and information to the region.
We are also announcing today that the U.S. Coast Guard, Japan Coast Guard, Australian Border Force, and Indian Coast Guard, plan to launch a first-ever Quad-at-Sea Ship Observer Mission in 2025, to improve interoperability and advance maritime safety, and continuing with further missions in future years across the Indo-Pacific.
We also announce today the launch of a Quad Indo-Pacific Logistics Network pilot project, to pursue shared airlift capacity among our nations and leverage our collective logistics strengths, in order to support civilian response to natural disasters more rapidly and efficiently across the Indo-Pacific region.
Quality Infrastructure 
The Quad remains committed to improving the region's connectivity through the development of quality, resilient infrastructure.
We are pleased to announce the Quad Ports of the Future Partnership, which will harness the Quad's expertise to support sustainable and resilient port infrastructure development across the Indo-Pacific, in collaboration with regional partners. In 2025, we intend to hold a Quad Regional Ports and Transportation Conference, hosted by India in Mumbai. Through this new partnership, Quad partners intend to coordinate, exchange information, share best practices with partners in the region, and leverage resources to mobilize government and private sector investments in quality port infrastructure across the Indo-Pacific region.
We applaud the expansion of the Quad Infrastructure Fellowships to more than 2,200 experts, and note that Quad partners have already provided well over 1,300 fellowships since the initiative was announced at last year's Summit. We also appreciate the workshop organized by the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure in India, working to empower partners across the Indo-Pacific to strengthen power sector resilience.
Through the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience, we continue to support and strengthen quality undersea cable networks in the Indo-Pacific, the capacity, durability, and reliability of which are inextricably linked to the security and prosperity of the region and the world. In support of these efforts, Australia launched the Cable Connectivity and Resilience Centre in July, which is delivering workshops and policy and regulatory assistance in response to requests from across the region. Japan will extend technical cooperation to improve public ICT infrastructure management capacity for an undersea cable in Nauru and Kiribati. The United States has conducted over 1,300 capacity building trainings for telecommunication officials and executives from 25 countries in the Indo-Pacific; today the U.S. announces its intent, working with Congress, to invest an additional $3.4 million to extend and expand this training program.
Investments in cable projects by Quad partners will help support all Pacific island countries in achieving primary telecommunication cable connectivity by the end of 2025. Since the last Quad Leaders' Summit, Quad partners have committed over $140 million to undersea cable builds in the Pacific, alongside contributions from other likeminded partners. Complementing these investments in new undersea cables, India has commissioned a feasibility study to examine expansion of undersea cable maintenance and repair capabilities in the Indo-Pacific.
We reaffirm our support for the Pacific Quality Infrastructure Principles, which are an expression of Pacific voices on infrastructure.
We underscore our commitment to an inclusive, open, sustainable, fair, safe, reliable and secure digital future to advance our shared prosperity and sustainable development across the Indo-Pacific. In this context, we welcome the Quad Principles for Development and Deployment of Digital Public Infrastructure.
Critical and Emerging Technologies 
Today, we are proud to announce an ambitious expansion of our partnership to deliver trusted technology solutions to the broader Indo-Pacific region.
Last year, Quad partners launched a landmark initiative to deploy the first Open Radio Access Network (RAN) in the Pacific, in Palau, to support a secure, resilient, and interconnected telecommunications ecosystem. Since then, the Quad has pledged approximately $20 million to this effort.
Quad partners also welcome the opportunity to explore additional Open RAN projects in Southeast Asia. We plan to expand support for ongoing Open RAN field trials and the Asia Open RAN Academy (AORA) in the Philippines, building on the initial $8 million in support that the United States and Japan pledged earlier this year. The United States also plans to invest over $7 million to support the global expansion of AORA, including through establishing a first-of-its-kind Open RAN workforce training initiative at scale in South Asia, in partnership with Indian institutions.
Quad partners will also explore collaborating with the Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation to ensure the country's readiness for nationwide 5G deployment.
We remain committed to advancing our cooperation on semiconductors through better leveraging of our complementary strengths to realize a diversified and competitive market and enhance resilience of Quad's semiconductor supply chains. We welcome a Memorandum of Cooperation between Quad countries for the Semiconductor Supply Chains Contingency Network.
Through the Advancing Innovations for Empowering NextGen Agriculture (AI-ENGAGE) initiative announced at last year's Summit, our governments are deepening leading-edge collaborative research to harness artificial intelligence, robotics, and sensing to transform agricultural approaches and empower farmers across the Indo-Pacific. We are pleased to announce an inaugural $7.5+ million in funding opportunities for joint research, and welcome the recent signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation between our science agencies to connect our research communities and advance shared research principles.
The United States, Australia, India, and Japan look forward to launching the Quad BioExplore Initiative—a funded mechanism that will support joint AI-driven exploration of diverse non-human biological data across all four countries.
This project will also be underpinned by the forthcoming Quad Principles for Research and Development Collaborations in Critical and Emerging Technologies.
Climate and Clean Energy 
As we underscore the severe economic, social, and environmental consequences posed by the climate crisis, we continue to work together with Indo-Pacific partners, including through Quad Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Package (Q-CHAMP), to enhance climate and clean energy cooperation as well as promote adaptation and resilience. We emphasize the significant benefits of transitioning to a clean energy economy for our people, our planet, and our shared prosperity. Our countries intend to strengthen our cooperation to align policies, incentives, standards, and investments around creating high-quality, diversified clean energy supply chains that will enhance our collective energy security, create new economic opportunities across the region, and benefit local workers and communities around the world, particularly across the Indo-Pacific.
We will work together, through policy and public finance, to operationalize our commitment to catalyzing complementary and high-standard private sector investment in allied and partner clean energy supply chains. To this end, Australia will open applications for the Quad Clean Energy Supply Chains Diversification Program in November, providing AUD 50 million to support projects that develop and diversify solar panel, hydrogen electrolyzer and battery supply chains in the Indo-Pacific. India commits to invest $2 million in new solar projects in Fiji, Comoros, Madagascar, and Seychelles. Japan has committed to $122 million grants and loans in renewable energy projects in Indo-Pacific countries. The United States, through DFC, will continue to seek opportunities to mobilize private capital to solar, as well as wind, cooling, batteries, and critical minerals to expand and diversify supply chains.
We are pleased to announce a focused Quad effort to boost energy efficiency, including the deployment and manufacturing of high-efficiency affordable, cooling systems to enable climate-vulnerable communities to adapt to rising temperatures while simultaneously reducing strain on the electricity grid.
We jointly affirm our commitment to addressing the challenges posed by climate change and ensure the resilience and sustainability of port infrastructure.

We thank Sri Lanka for its continued leadership as IORA Chair through this year and look forward to India's assuming the IORA Chair in 2025.
As Leaders, we are steadfast in our conviction that international law, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the maintenance of peace, safety, security and stability in the maritime domain, underpin the sustainable development, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific. We emphasize the importance of adherence to international law, particularly as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to address challenges to the global maritime rules-based order, including with respect to maritime claims. We are seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas. We continue to express our serious concern about the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea. We condemn the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels, including increasing use of dangerous maneuvers. We also oppose efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation activities. We reaffirm that maritime disputes must be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law, as reflected in UNCLOS. We re-emphasize the importance of maintaining and upholding freedom of navigation and overflight, other lawful uses of the sea, and unimpeded commerce consistent with international law. We re-emphasize the universal and unified character of UNCLOS and reaffirm that UNCLOS sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and the seas must be carried out. We underscore that the 2016 Arbitral Award on the South China Sea is a significant milestone and the basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties.
Together, with our global and regional partners, we continue to support international institutions and initiatives that underpin global peace, prosperity and sustainable development. We reiterate our unwavering support for the UN Charter and the three pillars of the UN system. In consultation with our partners, we will work collectively to address attempts to unilaterally undermine the integrity of the UN, its Charter, and its agencies. We will reform the UN Security Council, recognizing the urgent need to make it more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable through expansion in permanent and non-permanent categories of membership of the UN Security Council. This expansion of permanent seats should include representation for Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean in a reformed Security Council.
We stand for adherence to international law and respect for principles of the UN Charter, including territorial integrity, sovereignty of all states, and peaceful resolution of disputes. We express our deepest concern over the war raging in Ukraine including the terrible and tragic humanitarian consequences. Each of us has visited Ukraine since the war began, and seen this first-hand; we reiterate the need for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in line with international law, consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. We also note the negative impacts of the war in Ukraine with regard to global food and energy security, especially for developing and least developed countries. In the context of this war, we share the view that the use, or threat of use, of nuclear weapons is unacceptable. We underscore the importance of upholding international law, and in line with the UN Charter, reiterate that all states must refrain from the threat of or use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state.
We condemn North Korea's destabilizing ballistic missile launches and its continued pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). These launches pose a grave threat to international peace and stability. We urge North Korea to abide by all its obligations under the UNSCRs, refrain from further provocations and engage in substantive dialogue. We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula consistent with relevant UNSCRs and call on all countries to fully implement these UNSCRs. We stress the need to prevent any proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies related to North Korea in the region and beyond. We express our grave concern over North Korea's use of proliferation networks, malicious cyber activity and workers abroad to fund its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. In that context, we urge all UN Member States to abide by the relevant UNSCRs including the prohibition on the transfer to North Korea or procurement from North Korea of all arms and related materiel. We express deep concern about countries that are deepening military cooperation with North Korea, which directly undermines the global nonproliferation regime. As the mandate of the UN Panel of Experts tasked with monitoring violations of North Korea-related UNSCR sanctions was not renewed, we reiterate our commitment to continued implementation of the relevant UNSCRs which remain in full force. We reconfirm the necessity of immediate resolution of the abductions issue.
We remain deeply concerned by the worsening political, security and humanitarian situation in Myanmar, including in Rakhine State, and again call for an immediate cessation of violence, the release of all those unjustly and arbitrarily detained, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, resolution of the crisis through constructive and inclusive dialogue among all stakeholders, and a return to the path of inclusive democracy. We reaffirm our strong support for ASEAN-led efforts, including the work of the ASEAN Chair and the Special Envoy of the ASEAN Chair on Myanmar. We call for full implementation of all commitments under the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus. The ongoing conflict and instability have serious implications for the region, including increases in transnational crime such as cybercrime, the illegal drug trade, and human trafficking. We restate our appeal to all States to prevent the flow of arms and dual-use material, including jet fuel. We remain resolute in our support for the people of Myanmar and commit to continuing to work with all stakeholders in a pragmatic and constructive way, to find a sustainable solution to the crisis in a process which is led by the people of Myanmar and returns Myanmar to the path of democracy.
We call upon all States to contribute to the safe, peaceful, responsible, and sustainable use of outer space. We remain committed to fostering international cooperation and transparency, as well as confidence-building measures with the goal of improving the security of outer space for all States. We reaffirm the importance of upholding the existing international legal framework for outer space activities, including the Outer Space Treaty, and the obligation of all States Parties to the Treaty not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install such weapons on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space in any other manner.

We are committed to working together to promote accountability for the perpetrators of such terrorist attacks. We reiterate our condemnation of terrorist attacks including the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai and in Pathankot, and our commitment to pursuing designations, as appropriate, by the UN Security Council 1267 Sanctions Committee. We welcome the constructive discussions held at the first Quad Working Group on Counter-Terrorism and the fourth tabletop exercise in Honolulu last year, and look forward to Japan hosting the next meeting and tabletop exercise in November 2024.
We share great interest in achieving peace and stability in the Middle East. We unequivocally condemn the terror attacks on October 7, 2023. The large-scale loss of civilian lives and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is unacceptable. We affirm the imperative of securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and emphasize that the deal to release hostages would bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza. We underscore the urgent need to significantly increase deliveries of life-saving humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza as well as the crucial need to prevent regional escalation. We urge all parties to comply with international law, including international humanitarian law, as applicable. We welcome UNSCR S/RES/2735 (2024), and strongly urge all parties concerned to work immediately and steadily toward the release of all hostages and an immediate ceasefire. We call on all parties to take every feasible step to protect the lives of civilians including aid workers, and facilitate the rapid, safe and unimpeded humanitarian relief to civilians. We also encourage other countries, including those in the Indo-Pacific, to increase their support in order to address the dire humanitarian need on the ground. We underscore that the future recovery and reconstruction of Gaza should be supported by the international community. We remain committed to a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state taking into account Israel's legitimate security concerns as part of a two-state solution that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting, and secure peace. Any unilateral actions that undermine the prospect of a two-state solution, including Israeli expansion of settlements and violent extremism on all sides, must end. We underscore the need to prevent the conflict from escalating and spilling over in the region.
We condemn the ongoing attacks perpetrated by the Houthis and their supporters against international and commercial vessels transiting through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, which are destabilizing the region and impeding navigational rights and freedoms and trade flows, and jeopardize the safety of vessels and people on board including sailors.
We reaffirm our commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We underscore the importance of achieving the SDGs in a comprehensive manner without selectively prioritizing a narrow set of such goals, and reaffirm that the UN has a central role in supporting countries in their implementation. With six years left, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and accelerating progress toward all the SDGs in a comprehensive manner that is balanced across three dimensions—economic, social and environmental. From global health to sustainable development and climate change, the global community benefits when all stakeholders have the opportunity to contribute to addressing these challenges. We affirm our commitment to contributing to and implementing the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda and to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. We underscore our commitment to strongly engaging constructively in the discussion on advancing sustainable development, including at the Summit of the Future. The Quad continues to realize a safe and secure world where human rights and human dignity are protected, based on the central premise of the SDGs: ""Leave no one behind.""
We, the Quad Leaders, remain dedicated to working in partnership with Indo-Pacific countries in deciding our future and shaping the region we all want to live in.

Both leaders committed to close and sustained cooperation among our militaries.
Partners in a Stable, Integrated, and Prosperous Middle East and Wider Region 
The leaders stressed the importance of reaching a peaceful solution to the dispute over the three islands, Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb, and Abu Musa, through bilateral negotiations or the International Court of Justice, in accordance with the rules of international law including the UN Charter.
The leaders discussed persisting and emerging threats to peace and stability in the Middle East and the wider region. They renewed their commitment to upholding international law, particularly international humanitarian law, work with parties to resolve conflicts and protect civilians, and to provide urgently needed aid to alleviate human suffering. They reiterated the importance of sustainable and enduring solutions to the security threats in the region, including those posed by non-state terrorist actors. They discussed the enduring importance of the Abraham Accords and continuing on the path of peace, integration, and prosperity in the region.
The leaders discussed the war in Gaza. They underscored their commitment to continue working together towards ending the conflict, calling for a lasting and sustainable ceasefire and the release of hostages and detainees in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2735, and affirmed that all sides to the conflict must adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law. President Biden commended the UAE's extraordinary humanitarian efforts in Gaza, which have been critical in addressing the humanitarian crisis, including through the launch of a maritime corridor for movement of aid, opening a field hospital in Gaza, and supporting evacuations of wounded civilians and cancer patients.
The two leaders emphasized the ongoing need for the urgent, unhindered, and sustained delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance, at a scale commensurate with the growing needs among the civilian population throughout Gaza. They called on all parties to ensure the safety, security, and sustained access of aid workers to all those in need, and to create the conditions needed to facilitate an effective humanitarian response in Gaza.
His Highness President Sheikh Mohamed commended the mediation efforts by the United States, along with Egypt and Qatar, to reach a lasting and sustainable ceasefire and hostage release deal to help end the war in Gaza. His Highness also echoed the principles laid out by President Biden on May 31, 2024, and stressed the importance of building on this proposal in order to create a serious political horizon for negotiation. To that end, the leaders discussed a path to stabilization and recovery that responds to the humanitarian crisis, establishes law and order, and lays the groundwork for responsible governance. The leaders expressed their commitment to the two-State solution, wherein a sovereign and contiguous Palestinian state lives side-by-side in peace and security with Israel, as the only way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in accordance with the internationally-recognized parameters and the Arab Peace Initiative. They stressed the need to refrain from all unilateral measures that undermine the two-State solution, and to preserve the historic status quo of Jerusalem's holy sites, recognizing the special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in this regard.
On the conflict in Sudan, the leaders expressed their deep concern over the tragic impact the violence has had on the Sudanese people and on neighboring countries. Both leaders expressed alarm at the millions of individuals who have been displaced by the war, the hundreds of thousands experiencing famine, and the atrocities committed by the belligerents against the civilian population. They stressed that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Sudan and underscored their firm and unwavering position on the imperative for concrete and immediate action to achieve a lasting cessation of hostilities, the return to the political process, and transition to civilian-led governance.
Both leaders reaffirmed their shared commitment to de-escalate the conflict, alleviate the suffering of the people of Sudan, ensure humanitarian assistance reaches the Sudanese people, and prevent Sudan from attracting transnational terrorist networks once again. Noting their shared concern about the risk of imminent atrocities, particularly as fighting continues in Darfur, they underscored that all parties to the conflict must comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, and all individuals and groups that commit war crimes must be held accountable. The leaders emphasized that the priority right now must be the protection of civilians, particularly women, children and the elderly, securing humanitarian pauses in order to scale up and facilitate the movement of humanitarian assistance into the country and across conflict lines, and ensuring the delivery of aid to those in need, especially to the most vulnerable.
Partners in Cyberspace 
The leaders emphasized that safety and stability in cyberspace is critical for digital economic growth and development, and reaffirmed their commitment to an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable internet, underpinned by the multistakeholder model of internet governance.
They committed to deepen cooperation on cybersecurity and to enhance cyber collaboration to protect critical infrastructure, counter malicious cyber activity by state and non-state actors, and noted that the UAE's significant contributions to the International Counter Ransomware Initiative reflects the strength of our cooperation. The leaders committed to promote stability in cyberspace based on the applicability of international law including the United Nations Charter, the promotion of voluntary norms of responsible state behavior during peacetime, and the development and implementation of confidence building measures between states.
Looking Forward 
The United States and the United Arab Emirates are both entrepreneurial nations, joined together by a relentless focus on the future. Our aspirations are rooted in a common resolve to pursue innovative partnerships in new fields, including AI, food security, infrastructure investment, and supply chain resilience, even as we continue to strengthen the foundational element of our partnership: our longstanding people-to-people ties. These connections between our countries drive progress and expand horizons, from clean energy technologies, to AI, defense cooperation, space exploration, and ongoing coordination across priority areas of science, education, and culture. This first-ever official visit by a President of the United Arab Emirates to the United States sets a new foundation for our countries' cooperation for decades to come.""

Well, Sheikh Mohamed, welcome back to Washington.
President Mohamed bin Zayed. Thank you, sir.
President Biden. You've been a good friend. Our countries have a strategic partnership rooted in decades—literally decades—of close cooperation and friendship. And I welcome the chance to open a new chapter here.
We—U.A.E. is a nation of trailblazers, always looking—always looking—to the future, always making big bets. And that's something our countries have in common and our people have in common.
In fact, it's a cornerstone of our growing cooperation in AI, in clean energy, in space, and investing in infrastructure to connect regions. And, for many years, our forces also stood shoulder to shoulder in the same most difficult places.
Today we honor that legacy and carry our relationship forward, as U.A.B.—U.A.E. is going to become a major defense partner of the United States, joining only one other country: India.
We also will discuss our efforts to end the war in Gaza and a number of regional issues. I've been briefed on the latest developments in Israel and Lebanon. My team is in constant contact with their counterparts, and we're working to deescalate in a way that allows people to return to their homes safely.
Mr. President, I want you to know that I remain committed to the U.A.E.'s security. And I look forward to our discussion; it's going to cover a lot of areas.
So, again, welcome. Sheikh?
President Mohamed bin Zayed. Thank you, Mr. President.
[At this point, President Mohamed bin Zayed spoke in Arabic, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]
Your Excellency, Mr. President, I am pleased to meet with you once again, and I would like to thank you for the warm reception. And I look forward to continuously discussing our relationship between the two nations.
And I would like to reaffirm that the United Arab Emirates has a firm and unwavering commitment to work with the United States of America for the sake of deepening the strategic partnership between our two nations.
Once again, Your Excellency, Mr. President, I am pleased to meet you, and I would like to extend to you and the American people the best of wishes.
President Biden. Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.

Q. Mr. President—[inaudible]—on Lebanon justified? Mr. President, is Israel starting this war?""	Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates"
"Sep 24, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-united-nations-general-assembly-new-york-city-19,Remarks to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City,"""[After walking to the podium, the President turned and addressed the United Nations leadership seated behind him as follows.]
Excuse my back.
[The President addressed the General Assembly as follows.]
My fellow leaders, today is the fourth time I've had the great honor of speaking to this assembly as President of the United States. It will be my last.
I've seen a remarkable sweep of history. I was first elected to office in the United States of America as a U.S. Senator in 1972. Now, I know I look like I'm only 40. I know that. [Laughter]
I was 29 years old. Back then, we were living through an inflection point, a moment of tension and uncertainty. The world was divided by the cold war. The Middle East was headed toward war. America was at war in Vietnam, and at that point, the longest war in America's history.
Our country was divided and angry, and there were questions about our staying power and our future. But even then, I entered public life not out of despair, but out of optimism.
The United States and the world got through that moment. It wasn't easy or simple or without significant setbacks. But we would go on to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons throughout the—through arms control and then go on to bring the cold war itself to an end. Israel and Egypt went to war, but then forged a historic peace. We ended the war in Vietnam.
The—last year, in Hanoi, I was—met with the Vietnamese leadership, and we elevated our partnership to the highest level. It's a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the capacity for reconciliation that today the United States and Vietnam are partners and friends, and it's proof that even from the horrors of war there is a way forward. Things can get better.
We should never forget that. I've seen that throughout my career. In the 1980s, I spoke out against apartheid in South Africa, and then I watched the racist regime fall. In the 1990s, I worked to hold Milošević accountable for war crimes. He was held accountable.
At home, I wrote and passed the Violence Against Women Act to end the scourge of violence against women and girls not only in America, but across the world, as many of you have as well. But we have so much more to do, especially against rape and sexual violence as weapons of war and terror.
We were attacked on 9/11 by Al Qaida and Usama bin Laden. We brought him justice.
Then I came to the Presidency in another moment in a crisis and uncertainty. I believed America had to look forward. New challenges, new threats, new opportunities were in front of us. We needed to put ourselves in a position to see the threats, to deal with the challenges, and to seize the opportunities as well.
We needed to end the era of war that began on 9/11. As Vice President to President Obama, he asked me to work to wind down the military operations in Iraq. And we did, painful as it was.
When I came to office as President, Afghanistan had replaced Vietnam as America's longest war. I was determined to end it, and I did. It was a hard decision, but the right decision.
Four American Presidents had faced that decision, but I was determined not to leave it to the fifth. It was a decision accompanied by tragedy. Thirteen brave Americans lost their lives along with hundreds of Afghans in a suicide bomb. I think those lost lives—I think of them every day.
I think of all the 2,461 U.S. military deaths over a long 20 years of that war; 20,744 American servicemen wounded in action. I think of their service, their sacrifice, and their heroism.
I know other countries lost their own men and women fighting alongside us. We honor their sacrifices as well.
To face the future, I was also determined to rebuild my country's alliances and partnerships to a level not previously seen. We did just that, from traditional treaty alliances to new partnerships like the Quad with the United States, Japan, Australia, and India.
I know many look at the world today and see difficulties and react with despair, but I do not. I won't. As leaders, we don't have the luxury.
I recognize the challenges from Ukraine to Gaza to Sudan and beyond: war, hunger, terrorism, brutality, record displacement of people, the climate crisis, democracy at risk, strains within our societies, the promise of artificial intelligence and its significant risks. The list goes on.
But maybe because of all I've seen and all we have done together over the decades, I have hope. I know there is a way forward.
In 1919, the Irish poet William Butler Yeats described a world, and I quote, where: ""Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,"" end of quote. Some may say those words describe the world not just in 1919, but in 2024. But I see a critical distinction.
In our time, the center has held. Leaders and people from every region and across the political spectrum have stood together. Turned the page—we turned the page on the worst pandemic in a century. We made sure COVID no longer controls our lives. We defended the U.N. Charter and ensured the survival of Ukraine as a free nation. My country made the largest investment in climate and clean energy ever, anywhere in history.
There will always be forces that pull our countries apart and the world apart: aggression, extremism, chaos, and cynicism, a desire to retreat from the world and go it alone.
Our task, our test is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than those that are pulling us apart, that the principles of partnership that we came here each year to uphold can withstand the challenges, that the center holds once again.
My fellow leaders, I truly believe we are at another inflection point in world history where the choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come.
Will we stand behind the principles that unite us? Will we stand firm against aggression? We—will we end the conflicts that are raging today? Will we take on global challenges like climate change, hunger, and disease? Will we plan now for the opportunities and risk of a revolutionary new technologies?
I want to talk today about each of these decisions and the actions, in my view, we must take.
To start, each of us in this body has made a commitment to the principles of the U.N. Charter, to stand up against aggression. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we could have stood by and merely protested. But Vice President Harris and I understood that that was an assault on everything this institution is supposed to stand for.
And so, at my direction, America stepped into the breach, providing massive security and economic and humanitarian assistance. Our NATO allies and partners in 50-plus nations stood up as well. But most importantly, the Ukrainian people stood up. And I ask the people of this chamber to stand up for them.
The good news is, Putin's war has failed in his—at his core aim. He set out to destroy Ukraine, but Ukraine is still free. He set out to weaken NATO, but NATO is bigger, stronger, and more united than ever before with two new members, Finland and Sweden. But we cannot let up.
The world now has another choice to make: Will we sustain our support to help Ukraine win this war and preserve its freedom or walk away and let aggression be renewed and a nation be destroyed?
I know my answer. We cannot grow weary. We cannot look away. And we will not let up on our support for Ukraine, not until Ukraine wins a just and durable peace [based; White House correction] on the U.N. Charter.
We also need to uphold our principles as we seek to responsibly manage the competition with China so it does not veer into conflict. We stand ready to cooperate on urgent challenges for the good of our people and the people everywhere.
We recently resumed cooperation with China to stop the flow of deadly synthetic narcotics. I appreciate the collaboration. It matters for the people in my country and many others around the world.
On matters of conviction, the United States is unabashed, pushing back against unfair economic competition and against military coercion of other nations in the South China Sea, in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, in protecting our most advanced technologies so they cannot be used against us or any of our partners.
At the same time, we're going to continue to strengthen our network of alliances and partnerships across the Indo-Pacific. These partnerships are not against any nation. They are building blocks for a free, open, secure, and peaceful Indo-Pacific.
We're also working to bring a greater measure of peace and stability to the Middle East. The world must not flinch from the horrors of October 7. Any country—any country—would have the right and responsibility to ensure that such an attack can never happen again.
Thousands of armed Hamas terrorists invaded a sovereign state, slaughtering and massacring more than 1,200 people, including 46 Americans, in their homes and at a music festival; despicable acts of sexual violence; 250 innocents taken hostage.
I've met with the families of those hostages. I've grieved with them. They're going through hell.
Innocent civilians in Gaza are also going through hell. Thousands and thousands killed, including aid workers. Too many families dislocated, crowding into tents, facing a dire humanitarian situation. They didn't ask for this war that Hamas started.
I put forward with Qatar and Egypt a cease-fire and hostage deal. It's been endorsed by the U.N. Security Council. Now is the time for the parties to finalize its terms, bring the hostages home, and secure security for Israel and Gaza free of Hamas's grip, ease the suffering in Gaza, and end this war.
On October 7—[applause]. Since October 7, we have also been determined to prevent a wider war that engulfs the entire region. Hizballah, unprovoked, joined the October 7 attack launching rockets into Israel. Almost a year later, too many on each side of the Israeli-Lebanon border remain displaced.
Full-scale war is not in anyone's interest. Even as the situation has escalated, a diplomatic solution is still possible. In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security to allow the residents from both countries to return to their homes on the border safely. And that's what working—that's what we're working tirelessly to achieve.
As we look ahead, we must also address the rise of violence against innocent Palestinians on the West Bank and set the conditions for a better future, including a two-state solution, where the world—where Israel enjoys security and peace and full recognition and normalized relations with all its neighbors, where Palestinians live in security, dignity, and self-determination in a state of their own.
Progress towards peace will put us in a stronger position to deal with the ongoing threat posed by Iran. Together, we must deny oxygen to terrorists—to its terrorist proxies, which have called for more October 7ths, and ensure that Iran will never, ever obtain a nuclear weapon.
Gaza is not the only conflict that deserves our outrage. In Sudan, a bloody civil war unleashed one of the world's worst humanitarian crises: 8 million—8 million—on the brink of famine, hundreds of thousands already there, atrocities in Darfur and elsewhere.
The United States has led the world in providing humanitarian aid to Sudan. And, with our partners, we have led diplomatic talks to try to silence the guns and avert a wider famine. The world needs to stop arming the generals, to speak with one voice and tell them: Stop tearing your country apart. Stop blocking aid to the Sudanese people. End this war now.
But people need more than the absence of war. They need the chance—the chance to live in dignity. They need to be protected from the ravages of climate change, hunger, and disease.
Our administration has invested over $150 billion to make progress and other sustainable development goals. It includes $20 billion for food security and over $50 billion for global health. We've mobilized billions more in private-sector investment.
We've taken the most ambitious climate action in history. We've moved to rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one. And today, my country is finally on track to cut emissions in half by 2030, on track to honor my pledge to quadruple climate financing to developing nations with $11 billion thus far this year.
We've rejoined the World Health Organization and donated nearly 700 million doses of COVID vaccine to 117 countries. We must now move quickly to face mpox outbreak in Africa. We are prepared to commit $500 million to help African countries prevent and respond to mpox and to donate 1 million doses of mpox vaccine now. We call on our partners to match our pledge and make this a billion-dollar commitment to the people of Africa.
Beyond the core necessities of food and health, the United States, the G-7, and our partners have embarked on an ambitious initiative to mobilize and deliver significant financing to the developing world. We're working to help countries build out their infrastructure, to clean energy transition, to their digital transformation—to lay new economic foundations for a prosperous future.
It's called the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We've already started to see the fruits of this emerge in Southern Africa and in Southeast Asia and in the Americas. We have to keep it going.
I want to get things done together. In order to do that, we must build a stronger, more effective, and more inclusive United Nations. The U.N. needs to adapt to bring in new voices and new perspectives. That's why we support reforming and expanding the membership of the U.N. Security Council.
My U.N. Ambassador just laid out our detailed vision to reflect today's world, not yesterday's. It's time to move forward.
And the Security Council, like the U.N. itself, needs to get back to the job of making peace; of brokering deals to end wars and suffering; this—[applause]—and to stop the spread of the most dangerous weapons; of stabilizing troubled regions in East Africa—from East Africa to Haiti, to Kenya-led mission that's working alongside the Haitian people to turn the tide.
We also have a responsibility to prepare our citizens for the future. We'll see more technological change, I argue, in the next 2 to 10 years than we have in the last 50 years.
Artificial intelligence is going to change our ways of life, our ways of work, and our ways of war. It could usher in scientific progress at a pace never seen before. And much of it could make our lives better.
But AI also brings profound risks, from deepfakes to disinformation to novel pathogens to bioweapons.
We've worked at home and abroad to define the new norms and standards. This year, we achieved the first-ever General Assembly resolution on AI to start developing global rules—global rules of the road. We also announced a Declaration of—on the Responsible Use of AI, joined by 60 countries in this chamber.
But let's be honest. This is just the tip of the iceberg of what we need to do to manage this new technology. Nothing is certain about how AI will evolve or how it will be deployed. No one knows all the answers. But my fellow leaders, it's with humility, I offer two questions.
First: How do we as an international community govern AI? As countries and companies race to uncertain frontiers, we need an equally urgent effort to ensure AI's safety, security, and trustworthiness. As AI grows more powerful, it must grow also—it also must grow more responsive to our collective needs and values. The benefits of all must be shared equitably. It should be harnessed to narrow, not deepen, digital divides.
Second: Will we ensure that AI supports, rather than undermines, the core principles that human life has value and all humans deserve dignity? We must make certain that the awesome capabilities of AI will be used to uplift and empower everyday people, not to give dictators more powerful shackles on human—on the human spirit.
In the years ahead, there way be—they may be—may well be no greater test of our leadership than how we deal with AI.
Let me close with this. Even as we navigate so much change, one thing must not change: We must never forget who we're here to represent. ""We the People."" These are the first words of our Constitution, the very idea of America. And they inspired the opening words of the U.N. Charter.
I've made the preservation of democracy the central cause of my Presidency.
This summer, I faced a decision whether to seek a second term as President. It was a difficult decision. Being President has been the honor of my life. There is so much more I want to get done. But, as much as I love the job, I love my country more. I decided, after 50 years of public service, it's time for a new generation of leadership to take my nation forward.
My fellow leaders, let us never forget, some things are more important than staying in power. It's your people—[applause]. It's your people that matter the most.
Never forget, we are here to serve the people, not the other way around. Because the future will be won by those who unleash the full potential of their people to breathe free, to think freely, to innovate, to educate, to live and love openly without fear.
That's the soul of democracy. It does not belong to any one country. I've seen it all around the world in the brave men and women who ended apartheid, brought down the Berlin Wall, fight today for freedom and justice and dignity.
We saw it—that universal yearning for rights and freedom—in Venezuela, where millions cast their vote for change. It hasn't been recognized, but it can't be denied. The world knows the truth.
We saw it in Uganda: LBGT [LGBT; White House correction] activists demanding safety and recognition of their common humanity.
We see it in citizens across the world peacefully choosing their future, from Ghana to India to South Korea, nations representing one-quarter of humanity who will hold elections this year alone.
It's remarkable, the power of ""We the People,"" that makes me more optimistic about the future than I've ever been since I was first elected to the United States Senate in 1972.
Every age faces its challenges. I saw it as a young man. I see it today. But we are stronger than we think. We're stronger together than alone. And what the people call ""impossible"" is just an illusion.
Nelson Mandela taught us, and I quote, ""It always seems impossible until it's done."" ""It always seems impossible until it's done."" My fellow leaders, there is nothing that's beyond our capacity if we work together. Let's work together.
God bless you all, and may God protect all those who seek peace.
Thank you.""	Remarks to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City"

Aren't all of our U.S. military musicians spectacular? Thank you for all that you—for joining us this evening. It's great to be with so many friends here.
For Joe, diplomacy is personal. It's why, for more than 50 years, he's created deep personal bonds with world leaders. He shows up for our allies and our partners. He listens and is always eager to debate complex international issues to find common ground.
Serving as First Lady has been—of the United States is the honor of my life. This is our—[applause]. Thank you.
This is our United Nations—our final United Nations General Assembly as President and First Lady. So tonight I want to take this moment to celebrate Joe and honor the relationships he's built with all of you—[applause]—to honor these relationships with all of you to shape a brighter future for people around the world.
Please join me in welcoming my husband, President Joe Biden.
The President. [Laughter] That was worth the trip. [Laughter]
Well, welcome everyone. I'm delighted to see you all. You know, my fellow leaders and friends we've honored here, it's an honor to welcome you here tonight.
I should start off by saying we owe a special thanks tonight to Mayor Bloomberg. He's not the mayor right now, but he's still the mayor. [Laughter] Mr. Mayor, thank you for all you've done.
I want to begin by quoting someone who I wish was here tonight: my mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden. Growing up, my mom had an expression. She had a lot of expressions. She had a backbone like a ramrod. But my mom, she used to say, ""Joey, remember, never bow, never bend, never yield, and never give up.""
Folks, as I said yesterday at the United Nations, I recognize the challenges the world faces: Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, Haiti, war, hunger, poverty, climate change. But my message to you tonight is this: We must never, ever, ever bow, bend, yield, or give up. And most importantly, we must never lose faith—lose faith in our abilities to do so much.
I was first elected to the United States Senate when I was 29 years old, 280 years ago. [Laughter] Since then, I've seen the impossible become—the impossible become reality, for real. I've seen the Berlin Wall come down. I've seen Poland leave the—[inaudible]—I shouldn't go on, I guess. But I've seen apartheid end. I've seen humanity pull together to prevent a nuclear war. I've seen war criminals and dictators face justice and accountability for human rights violations. And I've seen countries in the Middle East make peace. We must always remember.
In America, I was—[inaudible]—I spent a lot of time with Xi of China, and we were in the Tibetan Plateau, and it was one of my 90-some hours alone with him. And he looked at me; he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" This is an absolutely true story. He said, ""Can you define America for me?"" I said, ""Yes, in one word: possibilities—possibilities."" We believe anything is possible. No, I really mean it. Remember, nothing is impossible.
And, folks, look, in our time, we turn the page on the—on a whole range of issues. We turned the page. Nothing is impossible, as I said, but we turned the page on the worst pandemic in a century. We defended Ukraine as a tyrant threatened to wipe it off the map. We made the largest investment in history to fight climate change, the existential threat to humanity.
And, folks, time and again—and I mean this sincerely—time and again, our Nation and our world found a way forward. But make no mistake: It didn't happen by accident. Nothing was inevitable. It took people like all of you assembled here tonight refusing to give up, rejecting the forces that pull us apart, believing that change is possible, and fighting to make it so every single day. That's what you in this room assembled have done.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's our change. Together, we can broker deals, end wars and suffering. We can stop the spread of disease and dangerous weapons alike. We can make AI empower people, not shackle them. We can cut our emissions and achieve our climate ambitions. We can leave our children, literally, a better world.
That's our obligation, and we can. We can do this.
I can say to you—and I mean this sincerely—I've never more optimistic in my life because of all of you, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
So thank you, thank you, thank you. Keep it up.
And every time I'd walk out of my grandpop's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" My grandmother would go, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Spread it. Spread it. Spread it.
Folks, remember, nothing is beyond our capacity when we work together. Nothing at all.
So, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you're doing. I appreciate it very, very much.
It's an honor to be with you. Thank you.""	Remarks at a United Nations General Assembly Leaders' Reception in New York City"

His death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians.
The strike that killed Nasrallah took place in the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas's massacre on October 7, 2023. Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a ""northern front"" against Israel.
The United States fully supports Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups. Just yesterday I directed my Secretary of Defense to further enhance the defense posture of U.S. military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war.
Ultimately, our aim is to deescalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means. In Gaza, we have been pursuing a deal backed by the U.N. Security Council for a cease-fire and the release of hostages. In Lebanon, we have been negotiating a deal that would return people safely to their homes in Israel and southern Lebanon. It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater stability.""	Statement on the Death of Hassan Nasrallah"

To state the obvious, over the weekend, we had devastating storms in the South. I spoke with—for a couple hours with leaders yesterday affected by the hurricane and—Governor Kemp of Georgia, Governor Cooper of North Carolina, county officials in the Big Bend region of Florida, and other leaders in South Carolina and Tennessee about the broad and devastating impacts of Hurricane Helene.
It's not just a catastrophic storm, it's a historic history-making storm—the entire Southeast and Appalachia. Damage from the hurricane stretches across at least 10 States. Winds over 120 miles an hour in some places. Storm surges up to 15 feet and record flooding.
Communities are devastated. Loved ones waiting, not sure if their loved ones are okay because they can't contact them because there's no cell phone connections. Many more folks displaced with no idea when they'll be able to be—return to their home, if ever—if there's a home to return to.
So we're keeping our—we're keeping them all in our prayers and all the lives lost—those particularly that are unaccounted for—there's nothing like wondering, ""Is my husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father alive?""—and many more who remain without electricity, water, food, and communications and whose homes and businesses have washed away in an instant.
I want them to know we are not leaving until the job is done.
I also want you to know I'm committed to traveling to the impacted areas as soon as possible. But I've been told that it'd be disruptive if I did it right now. We will not do that at the risk of diverting or delaying any—any—of the response assets needed to deal with this crisis.
My first responsibility is to get all the help needed to those impacted areas. And I expect to be there——
[At this point, the President coughed.]
Excuse me, I have a cold—I expect to be there later this week.
I and my team are in constant contact with the Governors, mayors, and local leaders. The head of FEMA, Deanne Griswell [Criswell; White House correction], is on the ground now in northern—in North Carolina. She's going to stay in Asheville and the Appalachia region for the foreseeable future.
There's been reports of over 100 dead and—as a consequence of this storm, and there are reports of up 600 million—600 people unaccounted for because they can't be contacted. God willing, they're alive, but there is no way to contact them, again, because of the lack of cell phone coverage.
I've directed my team to provide every—every—available resource as fast as possible to your communities to rescue, recover, and to begin rebuilding.
In addition to FEMA—it includes the Federal Communications Commission to help establish communications capability, the National Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of Defense are going to provide all the resources at its disposal to rescue and assist in clearing debris and delivering lifesaving supplies.
So far, that's over 3,600 personnel deployed. That number is growing by the day.
I quickly approved requests from Governors of Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia, and Alabama for an emergency declaration. And I approved additional requests for the Governors of North Carolina, Florida, South Carolina and—for a disaster declaration to pay for debris removal, provide financial assistance directly—directly—to survivors.
FEMA and the Small Business Administration are there to help the residents whose homes and businesses were literally destroyed, washed away or blown away.
And the Federal search-and-rescue teams have been working side by side with State and local officials and partners in very treacherous conditions to find those who are missing, and they'll not rest until everyone is accounted for.
And I want to thank all the first responders and everyone who has been working around the clock. One of the brave teams that's volunteered to be there is from San Diego County Fire Department, set to travel all the way from California to North Carolina to help. But, on their way, they were in a terrible car accident in Louisiana. We pray for their full recovery, but it was a bad accident.
We know there is more to do, and we will continue to surge resources, including food, water, communications, and lifesaving equipment. We'll be there, as I said before, and I mean it, as long as it takes to finish this job.
Let me close with this. As President, I've seen firsthand the devastating toll that disasters like this take on families and communities. I've been on the ground at many disasters areas since I've been President——
[The President coughed.]
Excuse me—and I've heard dozens of stories from survivors about how it feels to be left with nothing, not even knowing where or when to get back on track.
I am here to tell every single survivor in these impacted areas that we will be there with you as long as it takes.
For the sake of yourselves—excuse me——
[The President coughed.]
——and your families, I urge everyone—everyone—returning to their communities and homes to listen to the local officials and follow all safety instructions. Take this seriously. Please be safe.
Your nation has your back, and the Biden-Harris administration will be there until the job is done.
God bless you all. And I'm thinking of those that are still wondering where your loved ones are.
Thank you.
Funding for Federal Disaster Assistance 
Q. Will you need to pass a supplemental to help the people in the Southeast, Mr. President?
The President. Say again.
Q. Will you need to ask Congress for a supplemental to help the people——
The President. That's my expectation, yes.
Hurricane Helene 
Q. Do you know roughly how much you're thinking at this point?
The President. Not yet. It's been—this is a historic storm. It's devastating. They've not seen anything like this before. And some of them were back-to-back; there were three storms in a row. So it's really, really devastating.

Q. Would you consider asking Congress to come back for a special session to pass the supplemental?
The President. That is something I may have to request, but I have—no decision has been made yet.

Q. Do you have a sense of where you'll go when you are able to go, sir?

Q. Is it a mistake for President Trump to be down there today in Georgia? Is that disruptive?

Q. On another issue on the other side of the world, in the Middle East. It's our understanding——
The President. I'm going to stick with this.
Q. What's that?
The President. I'm going to stick with this subject. But go ahead. I have a thousand Olympians——
Situation in the Middle East 
Q. Well, it's just the fact that Israel may be now launching a limited operation into Lebanon. Are you aware of that? Are you comfortable with their plans, as best you know them?

The President. Okay. Before I begin, I wanted to say a few words about Iran's missile attack on Israel today.
At my direction, the United States military actively supported the defense of Israel, and we're still assessing the impact. But, based on what we know now, the attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective, and this is testament to Israeli military capability and U.S. military.
I'm also—it's also a testament to intensive planning between the United States and Israel to anticipate and defend against the brazen attack we expected.
Make no mistake, the United States is fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel. And I just—I've been—spent the morning in the—and part of the afternoon in the Situation Room and meeting with my whole national security team and consulting with the Israelis indirectly, because—on—in terms of their impact on us.
And the national security team has been, as I said, in constant contact with Israeli officials and their counterparts. And is—and this is going to continue to be brought to me throughout the day.
We still have to share updates and—when we get them, and we will do that.
Hurricane Helene Response and Recovery Efforts 
And now I want to turn to what we're going to be talking about today: the damage done by this horrible hurricane.
My top priority—and I mean this sincerely, because we've been through a lot of these—my top priority is to ensure the communities devastated by this hurricane get the help and support they need as quickly as possible—as quickly as possible.
As we watched the storm from the Gulf region form, I also directed FEMA to redeploy a substantial number of assets and resources to ensure we were ready to deal with what we expected and to support all the folks in need.
We had over 1,000 Federal personnel, including search-and-rescue teams, at the ready, on the ground before it hit. Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama became the staging ground for responders throughout the entire region, with 2.7 million meals, nearly 2 million liters of water ready to be distributed before the hurricane hit. I immediately approved emergency declarations as soon as I received the requests from the Governors or the State officials.
Still, with all this preparation, this was a hurricane of unprecedented and historic proportions.
Over the past several days, I've been in regular contact with the Governors, the mayors, the county officials on—in all the affected areas. That includes Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Virginia.
Now, in the storm's wake, I've directed my team, including the leadership in key departments and agencies all across the Government, to send every—and I mean this seriously—every available resource that we have at our disposal to the affected region. And that's why we're here today with the Cabinet and those acting in Cabinet but—because some are deployed already—the Department of Defense, Agriculture, HHS, Transportation, Energy, Homeland Security, EPA, Commerce, Small Business Association, and the U.S. Carmy [Army; White House correction], the Corps of Engineers. We need to be all working together, and that's what we're going to talk about—that continued coordination we have going on.
I've been in frequent contact with the Governors and other leaders in the impacted areas, and we have to jump-start this recovery process. People are scared to death. People wonder whether they're going to make it.
We still haven't heard from a whole lot of people. This is urgent. People have to know how to know how to get the information they need.
So we'll be there until this work is done. I'm—it's going to cost—I predict to you; I don't have a number—I think it's going to cost billions of dollars to restore these areas to where they were before. Until the work is done, we're going to stay.
I'm going to—as I said, Congress needs to make sure that States have every available resource. And we have an obligation.
This is a storm of historic proportion. Nothing like this has happened in the region since the turn of the 20th century. I think the last was, what, 1914, 1916, in that range.
So that's what we're here to discuss: the detail of how we get all that's needed. And it's going to take a long time. It's going to take a long haul to restore these communities.
And I'm going to be heading down—anyway. I'll be in the region on Wednesday. And we've had people down there already. It's just going to be real—this is really consequential. Homes—come home and they're just washed away; entire roads washed up; cliffs—I mean, it's just devastating.
And so we're going to—it's going to take a lot of work, a lot of coordination. And if this were the middle of the term, I'd be asking Congress for—to prepare to—they haven't given me the money we need now for—for this—materials that we need for dealing with these devastating storms. It's going to cost——
[At this point, a cell phone rang.]
That's okay. It's probably—is that the Speaker calling me? [Laughter] He said he's in, right? [Laughter] Anyway.
So we're going to—we're going to now have our Cabinet meeting. And thank you all for being here.
Situation in the Middle East/Iranian Missile Attack on Israel 
Q. Mr. President, on—on the Middle East, how are you advising Israel to respond?
Q. How would—how would you like Israel to respond to Iran?
The President. That's an active discussion right now. We've got to get all the data straight. We've been in constant contact with the Israeli Government and our counterparts, and that's—remains to be seen.
Q. Thank you.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel
Q. What is your message to Prime Minister Netanyahu, and have you spoken with him today?
The President. I haven't spoken with him. We've spoken—we have spoken with all his people, and I'll be talking to him. And my message will depend on what we find—finally conclude is needed.
Iranian Missile Attack on Israel 
Q. What do you believe the consequences for Iran should be?

Previously participating members welcomed Argentina, Bahrain, Cameroon, Chad, the Council of Europe, Denmark, the ECOWAS Commission, Finland, the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise, Hungary, Morocco, the Organization of American States, the Philippines, the Republic of Moldova, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Vanuatu, and Vietnam as new CRI members.
During the Fourth CRI Gathering, members reaffirmed our joint commitment to develop collective resilience to ransomware, support members if they are faced with a ransomware attack, pursue the actors responsible for ransomware attacks and not allow safe haven for these actors to operate within our jurisdictions, counter the use of virtual assets as part of the ransomware business model, partner with the private sector to advise and support CRI members, and forge international partnerships so we are collectively better equipped to counter the scourge of ransomware.
Over the past year, this coalition has grown and continues to build upon the commitments made at the Third CRI Gathering in 2023. The United States launched a new fund for CRI members to strengthen members' cybersecurity capabilities through both rapid assistance in the wake of a cyber attack, as well as targeted support to improve cybersecurity skills, policies, and response procedures.
The Policy Pillar, led by Singapore and the United Kingdom, spearheaded efforts to build resilience against ransomware attacks and leverage the ecosystem to disrupt the ransomware criminal industry. These efforts seek to undercut the business model that underpins the ransomware ecosystem by driving forward work on secure software and labeling, methods to counter the use of virtual assets as part of the ransomware business model, policies to reduce ransom payments, increase and improve reporting, cyber insurance, and a playbook to guide businesses on how to prepare for, deal with, and recover from a ransomware attack. Of note, CRI members and insurance bodies have endorsed guidance to help organizations experiencing a ransomware attack. The guidance underscores the important role cyber insurance can play in helping to build resilience to cyber attacks and highlights actions organizations should explore during an incident. In addition, the Pillar held a table-top-exercise to assist members in identifying gaps in their processes, learning best practices and supporting members develop effective responses to ransomware attacks on the healthcare sector.
The Diplomacy and Capacity Building Pillar, led by Germany and Nigeria, expanded the CRI's partnerships with the addition of 18 new members to the coalition and mapped out the capacity building assets and needs of members. To foster collaboration, forge new partnerships, and recruit new members into the Initiative, CRI members hosted regional events throughout the year.
Under the leadership of Australia and Lithuania, the ICRTF focused its work on building resilience against malicious cyber attacks through international cooperation. Lithuania and Australia, as ICRTF co-chairs, worked to develop governance for information sharing and increase onboarding of members to the information sharing platforms led by Lithuania and Belgium as well as Israel and UAE. These platforms will allow members to easily share threat information and indicators of compromise. In a project led by INTERPOL and Australia, a comparative report was produced analyzing Ransomware Interventions and Remediation in CRI members' jurisdictions. Australia launched a website and member portal so CRI members can easily share information and best practices, foster collaboration, and use as a mechanism to request assistance from the CRI community when experiencing a ransomware attack. The ICRTF co-chairs presented a statement for members to join that calls for responsible behavior in cyberspace and encourages members to hold malicious actors accountable and deny them safe haven using all of the cyber diplomacy and law enforcement tools at their disposal.
Canada established a new Public-Private Sector Advisory Panel to advise and support CRI members in combating ransomware. This advisory panel will catalyze effective information sharing, build trust through clear expectations and person to person collaboration, and develop best practices to navigate practical hurdles.
The Initiative also hosted its first-ever event dedicated to examining the use of AI to counter ransomware attacks. Topics of discussion included the use of AI to track threat actor use, AI for Software Security, scenario planning around ransomware attacks on the healthcare industry, and tools such as watermarking to counter disinformation.
Through the Initiative's annual gathering as well as the dedicated work and regional meetings occurring between each meeting, we commit to working together at both a policy and operational level to counter ransomware threats and hold perpetrators of these malicious attacks accountable. CRI continues to call for responsible behavior in cyberspace and encourage members to call out malicious acts, and we remain committed to using all appropriate tools to achieve these goals, and are jointly committed to the following actions in support of this mission.""

"Oct 03, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-the-situation-the-middle-east,Joint Statement by Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders on the Situation in the Middle East,"""We, the Leaders of the G7, express deep concern over the deteriorating situation in the Middle East and condemn in the strongest terms Iran's direct military attack against Israel, which constitutes a serious threat to regional stability.
We unequivocally reiterate our commitment to the security of Israel. Iran's seriously destabilizing actions throughout the Middle East through terrorist proxies and armed groups—including the Houthis, Hezbollah, and Hamas—as well as Iran-aligned militia groups in Iraq, must stop. Yesterday we discussed coordinated efforts and actions to avoid escalation in the area.
A dangerous cycle of attacks and retaliation risks fueling uncontrollable escalation in the Middle East, which is in no one's interest. Therefore, we call on all regional players to act responsibly and with restraint. We encourage all parties to engage constructively to de-escalate the current tensions. International humanitarian law must be respected.
On the eve of the tragic anniversary of Hamas' attacks on October 7, 2023, we condemn once again in the strongest possible terms such unjustified acts of deliberate violence and stand with the families of the victims and the hostages taken by Hamas.
We also reiterate our call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the unconditional release of all hostages, a significant and sustained increase in the flow of humanitarian assistance, and an end to the conflict. We fully endorse the efforts by the US, Qatar and Egypt to reach such a comprehensive deal, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2735. The situation in Gaza is catastrophic, and tens of thousands of innocent lives have been lost. We reiterate the absolute need for the civilian population to be protected and that there must be full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access, as a matter of absolute priority. We will continue working to set the conditions for a durable peace, leading to a two State solution, where Israel and Palestine coexist side-by-side in peace, with security for both.
We are also deeply concerned about the situation in Lebanon. We recall the need for a cessation of hostilities as soon as possible to create space for a diplomatic solution along the Blue Line, consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. This is the only path to durably de-escalate tensions, stabilize the Israel-Lebanon border, fully restore the sovereignty, territorial integrity and stability of Lebanon, and return displaced citizens to their homes with safety and security on both sides. We urge all actors to protect civilian populations. We are committed to providing humanitarian assistance to address the urgent needs of civilians in Lebanon.
We also express our deep condolences to the families of the civilian victims in Israel, Gaza and Lebanon.
We underscore the importance of the United Nations in resolving armed conflict and mitigating the humanitarian impact in the Middle East. In this regard, we acknowledge the role of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to restore peace and security. We are committed to reinforce our support to the mission, pursuant to applicable UN resolutions.
We will continue to be in close contact with all actors to this end."""
"Oct 04, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-president-biden-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-national-economic,"Press Briefing by President Biden, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, and National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
2:06 P.M. EDT
THE PRESIDENT: Hey, folks. My name is Joe Biden. (Laughter.)
Q: Welcome to the briefing room.
Q: Welcome, Mr. President.
Q: We've been waiting for you.
THE PRESIDENT: Welcome to the swimming pool.
Q: Finally. This is -- this is great.
THE PRESIDENT: Hey, look, folks, good afternoon. The past two days have gotten some -- we've gotten very good news about the American economy.
Just yesterday, shipping carriers, after some discussion, and the International Longshoreman's Union came to an agreement to keep their ports in the East Coast and Gulf ports open. We averted what could have become a major crisis for the country. And a tentative agreement, which includes record wage increases for dockworkers and shows the importance of collective bargaining and represents, I think, critical progress toward a strong contract.
I especially want to thank the carriers, the port operators, and the longshoreman's union for reaching this agreement at a time when the nation has experienced such terrible devastation from Hurricane Helene. It was truly a service to the American people for all the parties to come together and to respond to our request to keep the ports open.
I was determined to -- to avert a crisis at this moment, because it's a critical moment. If we didn't do this now, we'd have a real problem.
I also want to thank my White House team for the work -- they worked around the clock to bring the parties together.
But, today, I -- we got more incredible news. Although the strength of the American economy is a -- it's about the strength of the American economy. The new jobs report, as you all know and you've been reporting, created 250,000 jobs in September. The expectation was for 150,000 jobs in September, which is -- far exceeds that number. Not only the previous two months -- but not only that, the previous two months was revised up 150,000 -- 75,000 jobs.
And from the very beginning, we were told time and again that the polices we were pursuing -- we'd put forward weren't --weren't going to work, make things worse, including some of the other team who are still saying they're going to make things worse. But we've proven them wrong.
You know, we were told our American -- we've -- we were told our American Rescue Plan was too big and it would crowd out private investment. We proved them wrong. It vaccinated a nation and got immediate economic relief to people in need.
When I came to office determined to end trickle-down economics and to grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up -- I know you're tired of hearing me say that over and over again, but that was the policy; it remains the policy -- because when you do that, everyone does well. When the middle class grows, the nation is stronger. And the nation is stronger when there is a strong union movement as well.
We were told it wouldn't work, but I was also determined to do what was ignored for much too long. Presidents have been authorized since the '30s to be able to spend the money given by Congress -- to spend the money on hiring American workers and using American product where they were available. And that's what we did.
We were told that was going to be a big problem, but all the money we -- I was authorized to spend by the Congress has gone to building a mi- -- to -- gone to hiring American workers and using American products. We were told it wasn't going to be -- I -- we were told that was going to be a big problem, but it's working.
We were also told that our historic laws to invest in America and all Americans would crowd out private-sector investment. Well, that was proven wrong too.
We've attracted nearly $1 trillion since we've come to office in private-sector investment from domestic and foreign companies investing in America -- in America. And not this stuff with sh- -- shipping jobs overseas for cheaper labor and bringing back a product to America. We're building it here and sending it overseas. And look at the results across the board.
Unemployment is back down 4- -- to 4.1 percent. And every month f- -- that Vice President Harris and I have been in office, we've been -- there's been -- we've created jobs every single month.
The nation has now created 16 million jobs since I've come to office, more jobs created in a single presidential term than at any time in American history.
Our GDP shows our economy grew at -- at 10 percent under my administration. Unemployment reached the lowest level in 50 years.
We were also told inflation couldn't come down without massive job losses or sending the economy into economic recession.
Once again, the outside experts were wrong. Inflation has come way down. Wages have gone up, growing faster than prices. The interest rates are down. A record 19 million new business applications have been filed for. The stock market continues to reach new heights.
We've got more work to do though to keep getting -- keep -- to keep getting prices down, like more affordable housing, extending what I've done for seniors and lowering prescription drug costs by letting Medicare negotiate the prices -- make sure that's available to everyone.
And, by the way, what we've done so far -- just what we've brought down the prices for seniors under Medicare, it saved the taxpayers billions of dollars -- billions of dollars. Saved the taxpayers billions of dollars. That's important to note because they don't have to pay the exorbitant and ratio- -- irrational prices that these companies are charging.
The simple fact is we've gone from an economy in crisis to literally having the strongest economy in the world. And -- but we got -- we -- we got more work to do. We've got more work to do to deal the -- the things I've just mentioned. And we're going to have to deal with unforeseen costs of what this -- this hu- -- this hurricane is going to cost. It's going to cost a lot of money, and I'm going to probably have to ask the Congress before we leave for more money to deal with some of those problems, but that remains to be seen.
I'll take a few questions before I turn it over to --
Q: Mr. President --
THE PRESIDENT: You pick out the questions.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, okay. Yes, sir. (Laughter.) Yes, sir.
Go ahead, Josh.
Q: Thanks again for doing this, Mr. President. Two questions. The first, Florida Senator Marco Rubio described today's jobs report as having ""fake numbers."" What do you make of that? And how worried are you that many Americans are hearing that the jobs numbers aren't real?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, I'm going to be very careful here. If you notice anything the MAGA Republicans don't like, they call ""fake."" Anything. The job numbers are what the job numbers are. They're real. They're sincere. They're -- what we are.
But -- and, by the way, just look at how the EU talks about us, how they'd like to have an economy like ours. Let's talk about the rest of the world looks at us and what we're doing.
So, I -- well, I don't want to get going.
Q: And -- and then, secondly, could you clarify some of your comments yesterday with regard to strikes on Iranian oil facilities? What did you mean by them, given some of the reactions we're seeing in the market?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the Israelis have not concluded how they're -- what they're going to do in terms of a strike. That's under discussion. I think there are -- if I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Weijia.
Q: Thank you, Karine. Thank you so much, Mr. President, for being here.
This week, Senator Chris Murphy said, ""It's certainly a possibility that the Israeli government is not going to sign any diplomatic agreement prior to the election,"" which is what you have been calling for for so long, ""potentially to try to influence the result.""
Do you agree? Do you have any worries that Netanyahu may be trying to influence the election, and that's why he has not agreed to a diplomatic solution?
THE PRESIDENT: No administration has helped Israel more than I have. None. None. None. And I think Bibi should remember that.
And whether he's trying to influence the election, I don't know, but I'm not counting on that.
Q: You've said many times recently that you want to speak to him, that you plan to --
THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn't say ""plan to."" I didn't say ""want to.""
Q: You don't want to?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn't say that. You're making it sound like I'm seeking an inv- -- speak- -- I'm assuming when they make their judgment of how they're going to respond, we will then have a discussion.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Selina.
Q: Thank you.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President, for being here. What are you advising the Israelis to do in terms of their retaliation to Iran? And at this point, you still haven't spoken to Netanyahu. Is it fair to say that you have little personal influence over what he decides to do?
THE PRESIDENT: No. Look, our -- our teams are in contact 12 hours a day. They're constantly in contact. I've already had my presidential daily brief. We've already had interface between our military, our -- the diplomats. It's in constant contact.
They are trying to figure out -- this is High Holidays as well. They're not going to make a decision immediately. And so, we're going to wait to see what they -- when they want to talk.
Q: But over the past few months, they've consistently defied your administration's own advice. So, do you believe that the Israelis are going to listen to the advice you're giving them?
THE PRESIDENT: What I know is the plan that I put together received the support of the U.N. Security Council and the vast majority of our allies around the world as a way to bring this to an end.
One of -- look, the Israelis have every right to respond to the vicious attacks on them not just from the Iranians but from the -- everyone from Hezbollah to the Houthis to -- anyway. And -- but the fact is that they have to be very much more careful about dealing with civilian casualties.
Q: So, how should they respond? You expressed concerns about attacks on Iranian oil facilities. How should they respond?
THE PRESIDENT: That's between me and them.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. We got to move on. Go ahead, Tam.
Q: The election is a month away. One, I'd like to know how you're feeling about how this election is going. And then, also, do you have confidence that it will be a free and fair election and that it will be peaceful?
THE PRESIDENT: Two separate questions.
Q: Very much.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm confident it'll be free and fair. I don't know whether it will be peaceful.
The things that Trump has said and the things that he said last time out when he didn't like the outcome of the election were very dangerous.
If you notice -- I -- I noticed that the vice-presidential Republican candidate did not say he'd accept the outcome of the election. And they haven't even accepted the outcome of the last election. So, I'm -- I'm concerned about what they're -- what they're going to do.
Q: Are you making any preparations? Getting security briefings related to domestic security?
THE PRESIDENT: I always get those briefings.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. We got to move on. Go ahead, Akayla. And we have -- do a couple more.
Q: Hi. Hi, Mr. President. When are you considering imposing sanctions on Iran? And would you include oil in those sanctions?
THE PRESIDENT: That's som- -- that's be- -- that's under consideration right now, the whole thing. I'm not going to discuss that out loud.
Q: And just on your comments yesterday on the port strike. You said by ""the grace of God,"" it's going to hold. Is there any reason you think that this --
THE PRESIDENT: Well, there's more to do.
Q: -- this temporary suspension --
THE PRESIDENT: It's a month from now, and there's more to do in terms of everything from the whole notion of me- -- me- -- excuse me -- mechanization of the ports and the like. There's more to more to re- -- more to resolve.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Danny.
Q: Thanks, Karine. Thank you, Mr. President. Last night, you said that there's still a lot to do to avoid an all-out war in the Middle East. I mean, firstly, aren't we pretty close to that definition already? And -- and, secondly, what -- what can you really do to stop that happening?
THE PRESIDNET: There's a lot we are doing. The main thing we can do is try to rally the rest of the world and our allies into participating, like the French are, in -- in Lebanon and other places to tamp this down. And -- but when you have proxies as irrational as Hezbollah and the Houthis and -- it's a -- it's a hard thing to determine.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Toluse.
THE PRESIDENT: I've got to go, kid.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I know. I know. (Laughter.) He's telling me, ""I got to go.""
THE PRESIDENT: I said I'd take a couple questions. (Laughter.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right.
Q: We'll take (inaudible) --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You're the la- -- you're the last one, Toluse.
THE PRESIDENT: I think she's decreasing her credibility. (Laughter.)
Q: First -- first time in four years; you have to take some more.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Toluse, you're going to be the last one.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for -- for spending some time here with us. There have obviously been a number of crises that the country has been facing over the past several days with the hurricane, with port strike, with the situation in the Middle East. Can you talk about how your vice president, who is running for the presidency, has worked on these crises and what role she has played over the past several
days?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, she's -- I'm in constant contact with her. She's aware of where -- we all -- we're singing from the same song sheet. We -- she helped pass the l- -- all the laws that are being employed now. She was a major player in everything we've done, including passage of legislation, which we were told we could never pass. And so, she's been -- and her -- her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we're doing.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, sir. Thank you, sir.
(Cross-talk.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: It's up to you, sir. (Laughs.)
(Cross-talk.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Totally up to you, sir.
(Cross-talk.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. All right. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.
(Cross-talk.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, Nandita. Nandita.
Sir -- sir -- no. No. Sir -- I didn't call on you, sir. I didn't call on you. Nandita.
Q: Pope Francis is calling for a day of --
Q: Thank you. Thank you, Karine.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Nandita.
Q: -- prayer --
Q: Mr. President --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go, Nandita.
Q: -- and fasting. What's --
Q: Mr. President --
THE PRESIDENT: On Pope Francis --
Q: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: -- calling for a day of prayer and fasting --
Q: A day of prayer and fasting this Monday, October 7th. You reaction, sir?
THE PRESIDENT: I will prayer and fast.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. That's --
(Cross-talk.)
Q: Mr. President, what is acceptable to you in terms of Israel's response? How long are you okay with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?
Q: Mr. President --
(Cross-talk.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, guys. That's it. Thank you, everybody.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
(Cross-talk.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you, every- -- thank you, sir.
Q: Mr. President, on Ukraine. Have you made a decision on long-range weapons?
Q: Do you re- -- want to reconsider dropping out of the race?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm back in. (Laughter.)
Q: What made you want to come here today, Mr. President?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, everybody.
Q: Thank -- thank you, Mr. President.
Q: Thank you.
Q: Please come back.
Q: Thank you, Karine.
Q: Karine, can we do that again?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No. (Laughter.)
You hear- -- you heard I was already told that. (Laughs.)
Q: So, that's why we were late?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, are we always on -- any -- always on time? (Laughter.) I -- I could call myself out for that.
All right, everybody. Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President.
Okay. So, this week, the United States has faced a -- a number of competing challenges, from tensions in the Middle East, to a port strike that threatened our nation's supply chains, to a historic hurricane that washed away entire communities.
Moments like these underscore the importance of American leadership and resolve, and they show what is possible when we come together.
Under the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris, we were able to successfully protect our allies, ensure the viability of critical supplies, stand up for good-paying union jobs, and get resources to people impacted by the storm in North Carolina and beyond.
In the Middle East, the president showed that our ironclad support for Israelis' security is not just a talking point; it saves lives. Prior to Iran's attack on Israel, the president convened his national security team in the Situation Room to monitor developments in real time, ensure we were prepared to assist in Israelis' defense, and protect U.S. personnel in the region.
Under the president's leadership, the United States successfully defended Israel an- -- from Iran's missiles, standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of Israel.
On the home front, the president and his team brought union workers, ocean carriers, and port operators to the table to -- successfully to resolve a strike that threatened U.S. supply chains and the economic progress this president has made to lower prices for the American people.
And in the Southwest United States -- Southeast, pardon me, United States, the administration pre-positioned 1,500 federal personnel, along with critical resources like food, water, and fuel, to ensure that communities in the path of Hurricane Helene were prepared ahead of the storm.
Now, we are getting more resources into the hardest-hit communities every day, and we have provided over $45 million directly to individuals and families to help them recover.
And a wide range of bipartisan officials, including the governors of every affected state, are working together with us and have praised the federal response.
These response- -- responses underscore why leadership matters. The president's leadership in this moment helps to save lives, pra- -- protect critical alliances, and ensure that our economy remains strong. But more importantly, it proves that nothing is beyond America's capacity when we do it together.
And really quickly, because I know you all a- -- asked for this. This is the week ahead. Next week, the president will travel to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to discuss his administration's work to replace lead pipes in the state and across the country through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This law is investing historic resources into our communities and creating good-paying jobs.
The president will also be traveling to Philadelphia for a campaign engagement.
He will also travel to Germany and Angola to underscore the enduring strength and importance of two strategic bilateral relationships in addressing a comprehensive range of global stra- -- challenges. The value of strong alliances and partnerships in the defense of freedom and democracy has never resonated more in Europe, Africa, and beyond.
President Biden has made revitalizing our international alliances and partnerships a key priority, recognizing that today's challenges require global perspectives and shared responses.
Those are the details I am able to share with -- for now, but certainly, we will have more in the upcoming days.
And finally, n- -- finally, we have Lael Bran- -- Brai- -- Brainard -- (laughs) -- our national economic adviser to the president. She's going to provide more information on how the president helped reopen our ports, as well as the strong job market economy report that we saw today, showing that more than 250,000 jobs this -- this September under the president -- President Biden.
MS. BRAINARD: Well, thanks, Karine. And it's good to see everybody today.
It is a good day for American workers and families. We saw more than 250,000 new jobs created in the month of September. We saw unemployment back down to 4.1 percent at a time when inflation is back down to pre-pandemic levels.
The East Coast and Gulf ports are opening back up, and dockworkers are getting back to work on the basis of a strong tentative agreement on wages and a contract extension between the International Longshoreman's Association and the United St- -- States Maritime Alliance.
Just a week ago, the negotiation had totally stalled out. The union and employers had not spoken to each other for months. The last time a wage offer had been put on the table was in the middle of 2023.
The president and the vice president directed us to get the parties back to the table to reach a good deal. We worked around the clock to help them find common ground.
And the president was clear throughout that process on three things: We needed to get the union and the employers back to the table on the basis of a strong progress on wages so nothing would get in the way of hurricane recovery; Taft-Hartley was off the table because collective bargaining works; and workers should share in the large profits of the ocean carriers, particularly after those dockworkers sacrificed so much to keep goods moving for the American public during the pandemic.
And as a result of the hard work that I undertook along with Secretary Buttigieg, [Acting] Secretary Su, a number of people in the White House. We are seeing dockworkers get a fair share of the industry's record returns. We're seeing ports opening so consumers and businesses can get what they need. And we don't expect to see any effects on our economy or for consumers, businesses, and farmers because we have strong supply chains that we built in the wake of the pandemic.
The president and the vice president have consistently supported the collective bargaining process. When employers and workers come to the table, they find a good outcome.
That's a vastly different approach from previous administrations that might have busted unions and rolled back worker protections.
And finally, I would simply say that the data that we're seeing, the data we saw last week confirms that our economy is delivering for workers.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. I'm going to take a couple of questions.
Go ahead, Selina.
Q: Thank you so much for being here. Would you say at this point that the U.S. has achieved a soft landing? And if not, at what point will we be there?
MS. BRAINARD: Yeah, I would say that, look, we have seen unemployment -- the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in 50 years, and we have seen inflation come back down to pre-pandemic levels.
That is exactly the kind of growth that you would want to see. Growth has actually been revised up. It's been above 3 percent over the last year, and we're continuing to see very resilient consumers. So, yes, that's exactly the kind of Goldilocks results that you would want to see.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Josh.
Q: Thanks again for doing this. If I could ask about an otherwise strong jobs report. You still have manufacturing employment dip by 7,000. What do you think is happening in the manufacturing sector right now? Is this response to higher rates, or are you seeing something else going on?
MS. BRAINARD: Yeah, so I think if you look more broadly across the administration, you have seen manufacturing jobs growing by more than 700,000, in contrast to the previous administration that actually saw manufacturing job losses even before the pandemic.
And I think the right way to think about this -- because we have so much new investment dollars from the Investing in America agenda, the right way to think about it is to look at construction and manufacturing jobs together. And there, what we've seen is continued growth.
That construction workforce is hard at work with factory construction that is multiples of the previous administrations. That construction of factories is going to turn into the manufacturing jobs of the future.
So, we see that investment in today's economy, whether it be in chip manufacturing or clean energy, that is going to result in tomorrow's manufacturing jobs.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.
Q: Thank you, Karine.
Just after the last Fed rate cut, do you think the administration has won its fight against inflation?
MS. BRAINARD: So, I would say, if you look at the data on inflation, it is now back down to pre-pandemic levels. Don't forget, nobody said that could happen with a strong labor market. I think people just really need to go back and see some of the predictions. Nobody thought we could have the strongest recovery in our peer economies -- strongest on jobs, strongest on growth -- and get inflation down as fast as we did.
And so, that just shows that the president's investments and the focus on supply chains has really worked.
Q: And then just a follow-up on the consumer confidence
numbers. I mean, there was, you know, an upward revision in August, but now it's down in September. I'm just sort of wondering if you can comment on that.
MS. BRAINARD: Yeah, so I think the most recent Michigan sentiment numbers actually are showing strength. And, you know, if you look at what consumers are talking about, they're talking about good jobs, good job opportunities. And we've seen a lot of people moving into new sectors with better wages, and there is now a lot more confidence that interest rates are coming down, inflation is down, and that's going to enable consumers to feel more confident about investing in some of those bigger-ticket items.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Just a couple more.
Go ahead.
Q: Thank you. On the jobs report, the data also showed that the employment picture in July and August was also brighter than previously thought. For Americans who are concerned about the rate that they may pay on their mortgage or their car that they might buy, what do you see that doing to the path of interest rates going forward?
MS. BRAINARD: You know, I think that we are now in a part of the recovery where inflation is back down, and that's really what is going to determine whether interest rates continue to fall. And market interest rates have remained low. Mortgage rates have come all the way down close to 6 percent. We anticipate, because inflation is back down, that that will continue to show through to market rates.
Q: And on the hurricane that ravaged the Southeast, what are your early indications of how that could impact economic growth and the jobs picture in November, with so many in that region out of work?
MS. BRAINARD: Yeah, so we do think normally with a hurricane of this size, with the devastation that it has caused in many communities, that it will affect the employment statistics for that month. But what we know is that, generally, you see the economy overall bouncing back very quickly and the growth numbers really becoming sort of strong pretty rapidly because of all that rebuilding activity that we are committed to.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Jacqui.
Q: That was my --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, okay.
Q: -- on interest rates. Yeah. (Laughter.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead.
Q: How concerned are you right now about the instability
in the Middle East and its impact on oil prices?
MS. BRAINARD: Yeah, so, it is something that we track very closely. Obviously, prices at the pump right now, $3.18 on average -- not that I track it closely, but that is today's number -- (laughter) -- and below $3 in many states. We believe that global markets are well supplied, and continue to expect that in the U.S., we'll continue to see those low gas prices.
And of course, we have really effective ways of addressing some of those geostrategic volatility. We've used it in the past. We have the capacity to use it again.
So, right now, markets are very well supplied, and we anticipate them to remain so.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, last question to -- oh --
Q: Yeah, I'll --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, I -- I can go to Gerren too. (Laughs.) Go ahead.
Q: Thanks. A federal judge in Missouri issued an injunction blocking the president's student loan program hours after a judge in Georgia allowed it to advance. What is the White House's message to this dizzying legal battle? And that was lifted up as an economic policy to, particularly, closing the racial wealth gap. And what is your message to Black and brown Americans who are really relying on this relief?
MS. BRAINARD: Yeah. So, student loan debt relief is so important for so many young people who are trying to build wealth, particularly for people who are first generation, to be able to invest in small businesses, to invest in starting a family, to invest in a house for the first time. So, we are going to continue to work to deliver that debt relief to so many students who deserve it.
I do want to say that we have 5 million Americans who have already received debt relief. And, you know, you can go on TikTok and other social media platforms and see their testimonials what a difference it makes in their lives. And that is why the president, vice president going to continue working so hard to deliver.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Awesome. Thank you so much, Lael.
MS. BRAINARD: Thank you.
Q: More Americans are food insecure.
MS. BRAINARD: Thank you.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you. Thank you so much.
Q: Could you address food insecurity?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I appreciate it.
Q: The numbers are rising --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you, thank you.
Q: -- according to the USDA. Food insecurity numbers?
Maybe, Karine, if you could address it?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: No. Not -- not right now.
Q: Food insecurity?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I -- I'm -- I'm not talking to you, sir.
Q: Okay.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I'm just not. It would be nice if you would be less disrespectful in the room.
Q: I'm just asking questions.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Inappropriately.
Okay. Go ahead, Josh. I don't know if -- maybe you guys are done with me. Maybe I can walk out. (Laughs.) You guys got -- you guys got all the best. (Laughs.) You guys got all the best.
Go ahead, Josh.
Q: So, if we were to, like, zoom out --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.
Q: -- President Biden came in here today.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.
Q: He's going to be with Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey this week. Then he goes to Germany and Angola. He said he's singing from the same song sheet as vice president Kamala Harris on the campaign. How does he see his public role in the next few weeks as we get closer to the election? What does -- what's he trying to achieve?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I -- look --
Q: And how's he thinking about it?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think he's doing his job as president, right? I think that's the most important thing. I mean, I started off at the top, at least of this -- this part of the program, where I said that we've had three major events happen this week. And what did the president do? What did the vice president do? They worked shoulder and shoulder to deal with these major events.
Now we see a deal with the port -- a negotiated deal with the ports. Obviously, it -- it -- that collective bargaining is extended until January 15th, which is incredibly important, especially in the midst of a hurricane that we saw -- this historic hurricane that we just saw -- Hurricane Helene.
We s- -- we see what's happening in the Middle East. The president and the vice president continue to have diplomatic conversations, if you will, to deal -- to de-escalate, to deal with what we're seeing in -- in that -- in the region.
And the hurricane. You saw the -- the vice president in -- in Georgia; the president in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, himself, and also in North -- also in Florida, pardon me.
And so, I think what you're going to see is him continuing to do his job, working closely with the vice president.
Look, before Hurricane Helene, President Biden was planning to campaign this week, and you heard -- you heard me say he's going to go to Pennsylvania. He's going to go to Wisconsin next week. And so, we have -- you know, we -- we have -- you all have covered how much of a whirlwind week this has been.
And so, the president is going to be president. He's going to be commander in chief. And obviously, he's going to be supporting his vice president.
I can't speak specifically about the campaign because of -- we do respect the Hatch Act here -- at least for myself, as a federal employee, and many of us here.
And so, look, he's going to continue to -- to do the work that he's doing. We saw strong jobs numbers. That's one of the reasons he came out. He came out because he wanted to talk about that. He wanted to talk about what we have seen this week.
And so -- and so, look, we're going to continue to doing the work, and I think that's what the American people want to see.
Go ahead, Selina.
Q: Thanks, Karine. So, former President Donald Trump threatened to revoke the legal status of Haitian migrants.
What is the president's reaction to that? This is something that the former president had tried to do during his own administration.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, here's the fact. The fact is they are here legally, right? That is the fact. TPS, that's what it gives you. And honestly, I wouldn't take legal advice from the former president. I don't know. That's not something I would do.
Go ahead.
Q: And how concerned is the administration about the economic impact of Hurricane Helene?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, as you can see, we have been working around the clock. The president directed his team very early on to work around the clock to make sure that the states who were -- that were affected, the states that he's visited and the vice president has visited over the past couple of days, got everything that they need. And we -- and we did that by pre-positioning -- pre-positioning some of the personnel -- about 1,500 federal personnel -- to do that.
What we are doing: We're going to make sure -- obviously, we're going to always monitor any of the economic impact. But we're going to continue to make sure that we are dealing -- we are focused on lifesaving and life-sustaining efforts. That's the focus that we're going to have here.
And we're going to continue to monitor. But obviously, reacting and providing the needs of the states right now, of the -- of citizens who are living in those states is probably the most key and most important. And continue to call on Congress to move forward with additional funding.
As you know, in the CR there was a robust ask for funding -- for disaster funding, and that didn't make it in the bipartisan CR. And so, we got to get that done. And we're going to continue to have conversations with Congress.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Nandita.
Q: Karine, I tried asking the president this --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Nandita, I've called on you, like, three times today. (Laughter.) I know some folks in the back are just going to be like, ""Yeah.""
Q: I appreciate it. I appreciate it.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So -- yeah.
Q: I tried asking President Biden --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: (Laughs.)
Q: (Inaudible.)
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I hear you, Kimberly. I hear you.
Go ahead.
Q: What is acceptable to the U.S. in terms of Israel's response, right? How long is the U.S. comfortable with Israel bombing Lebanon?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I -- I know you guys are going to ask this question every which way, and I totally understand that. We are having conversations, discussions. We're in contact with the Israelis on -- on what's next.
We have been very clear there will be consequences. You saw the joint statement with the G7. There's going to be consequences. There's going to be sanctions. And I'm not going to preview those sanctions from here.
But we have always said Israel has the right to defend itself. And we -- and you saw just on Tuesday night -- and not just Tuesday night, in April -- how -- how much we are prepared to defend and protect Israel, because that is our ironclad commitment.
I'm not going to get into pu- -- into diplomatic conversations in -- in the public here.
Q: And there was a report that quotes U.S. officials saying the White House wants to take advantage of the massive blow to Hezbollah's leadership and infrastructure to push for a new Lebanese president in the coming days. Can you comment on that?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I'm not going to comment on that. I'm not going to comment on sources or reporting out there. That is -- that is not something I'm going to speak to, sourcing that I can't even verify from here.
Go ahead.
Q: Thank you. On the port strike reaching a tentative agreement. The White House and several officials were involved in -- in the 90-day extension of those talks. I'm wondering what the significance of that timeline is and whether the election being five weeks away played any role in it?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, this is about the right thing to do for workers. Many of those workers put their lives at risk during the pandemic. We have always said collective bargaining is -- works. We believe it works. And we have seen -- we have seen parties reach a fair agreement when you put -- when you have -- when they come in -- come to the table and -- in good faith and do that collective bargaining. This is what's important.
It was important to this president to get this done. This is not about an election. This is about what is the right thing to do for the American people. This is the right thing to do for -- for workers, again, who -- who deserve higher wages, who deserve benefits.
And so, the president is proud to have been able to do that. His team -- obviously, with his team, in the dir- -- and he directed his team to do this. And so, now collective bargaining is going to continue, and we'll see where we are in the next couple of -- couple of months.
But this is not about politics for this president. He -- and you have seen that in the last three and a half years when we've been in these types of situation where there was negotiation, and we have been very, very clear: collective bargaining and supporting workers.
Q: On congressional funding. You mentioned some of the items that were lacking in the short-term funding bill that Republicans had put forth. I'm wondering if the president has spoken with any members of the Big Four in Congress to bring those concerns to them directly.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, I don't have any conversations to speak to that the president has had with members of Congress.
I mean, you saw him on the road. He was able -- you saw him in a bipartisan way on the road in North Carolina, South Carolina, in Georgia, and -- and Florida. And he -- you saw him with Republican congressional members and governors and Republican -- and Democratic congressional members and also governors. And you saw that bipartisanship.
I'm certainly not going to get into any private conversations that they have had. But we will continue to speak to congressional leadership and members about getting that extra funding. It is important. They need to act. They need to act.
AIDE: Karine, you (inaudible).
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead. Go ahead.
Q: Hey, thanks, Karine. Can you talk about how President Biden will be marking Monday's one-year anniversary of the October 7th attack on Israel?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, obviously, it's going to be a painful -- a painful day for -- for many, including for -- for all of us here. And so, we will have more to share on how we will be commemorating that devastating day that we saw a year ago. Don't have anything to share at this time.
Q: And -- and, secondly, this was President Biden's first time -- correct? -- to the press briefing room --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.
Q: -- since he's --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yep.
Q: What -- why not --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: And you're welcome.
Q: Yeah.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: You're welcome. I know you're -- I know this --
Q: I know. I know.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I know the way -- the way this question is going to go.
Q: We appreciate it. I --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: It's going to be great. It's going to be great. (Laughs.)
Q: Let's -- let's do it again.
Q: I would have preferred a further question, but that's all -- that's all right. (Laughter.) But real quick: Why not -- why didn't he come in the three and a half years before?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I --
Q: Why --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, he came today. And you got to see him.
Q: Yes. Yeah, but --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: And you were here.
Q: -- you know, I mean, he had the opportunity --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Aw, man. Come on.
Q: All right. All right.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Come on. He was here. He took your questions. And he --
Q: It seemed like he wanted to stay a little bit longer.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I -- (laughter) --
Q: Every Friday?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: He is -- he is -- every Friday? (Laughter.) Friday -- Friday with the POTUS. Friday with the POTUS. We --
Q: I'll bring ice cream. Bring ice cream.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Well, no, you guys got to bring the ice cream. You guys got to bring the ice cream.
(Cross-talk.)
Okay. I'm going to do a couple more. Go ahead. I haven't called on you. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Q: Thank you, Karine. I want to go back to Haitians and the TPS. But first, you know, it was -- it's another week of misery in Haiti.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.
Q: There was this report from the World Food Programme describing acute hunger. What more can the U.S. do to improve the situation in Haiti? And conc- -- if there's no improvement, is it conceivable that the TPS for Haitians will never be lifted?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, on your last question, I'll do that first -- the last part of your question, I'll do that first. I -- we -- I can't predetermine what TPS status is going to be. It's not something that I can do from here. Obviously, as you know, that is a decision with DHS and the State Department. They decide TPS and the best way to move forward. So, I'm not going to get into a hypothetical about that.
But as it relates to Haiti more broadly and to the question of instability and what's happening, look, despite that -- despite the instability that continues, the recent deployment, as you know, of MSS mission is a unique opportunity to build a foundation of security and bring hope to Haitians that deserve to live their lives free of violence.
And so, to that end, the United States has delivered well over $300 million to support the MSS mission, while urging the international to community -- community to support that -- that mission as well. The United States will continue to hold those undermining Haiti's institutions and committing serious human rights abuses accountable. That is our commitment.
We are committed to doing our part both to address immediate security needs and invest in Haiti's long-term successes. We stand with the people of Haiti and will continue supporting their aspirations of more security, certainly democratic and prosperous future. That is our commitment, and we'll continue to support the mission.
Go ahead, Michael.
Q: Thanks, Karine. It seems as if the president has spoken with pretty much every governor in the affected --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: He has. He has. That was affected in the region.
Q: But has he spoken with Governor DeSantis of Florida?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Touché. Good point. So -- (laughter). Touché.
So -- and I think we read out that he spoke to the governor of Tennessee on our way back from -- back from our trip to Florida and Georgia yesterday.
I don't have a -- a conversation to read out with the Florida -- the governor of Florida. But what I can say is that we have been in touch. Our team has been in touch with local officials on the ground. We are committed to providing what is needed in the state, obviously, to those who were affected in the state, and are committed -- our commitment is clear. The president has always said it doesn't matter if you're in a red state or a blue state; he's a president for all Americans. And that's -- continues to be, certainly, his commitment.
Go ahead.
AIDE: Last one.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I know. I'm getting -- I'm getting pulled. But go ahead. Then I'll come back to you.
Q: Thank you, Karine. The president seemed to suggest that he is asking -- or he seems to be suggesting that Israel should consider other alternatives, rather than attacking Iranian oil facilities. But should Israel make such an attack, how is the administration preparing for an Iranian retaliation on the Strait of Hormuz that would disrupt oil supply and disrupt oil prices globally?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, also as the president said, we continue to have these discussions. I'm not going to get into hypotheticals Israel -- about Israel's response to Tues- -- Tuesday -- Tuesday night attacks.
What I will say is that we understand that they are still determining what exactly they will do. That is something that we understand.
I'm just not going to prejudge. I'm not going to get ahead of anything, and the discussions to continue.
Q: But can we say that the administration is preparing for that possibility?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I -- I'm just not going to get -- I'm not going to speculate. They're still -- I'm -- I'm telling you, they're -- still haven't decided what their next steps are going to be.
Q: Okay.
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So that's what I'm saying to you. That's what we understand. I don't have anything else beyond that.
Q: And on Angola -- on the President's trip, Karine. Amnesty International is criticizing the administration's, quote, ""silence"" on human rights violations in Angola ahead of the president's visit, calling out the administration's focus on private-sector investment to counter China. This is obviously in reference to the Lobito Corridor. Do you have a response?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, I mean, I -- we get this question -- this type of question about human rights violations any time he meets, he travels and if that's going to come up. The president, as you know, has never shied away from direct conversation about human rights and democracy in any conversation, and I could expect that he will do the same in this upcoming trip.
And so, I don't have anything beyond that, but the president has never shied away from that. Never shied away.
Go ahead.
Q: Thank you, Karine. Does the administration have any concerns about how the -- the aftermath of this storm could impact the vote, whether it's talking to the Postal Service about mail-in ballots that may not be getting to people or impacting the infrastructure in these critical states?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, we are go- -- using every available resources to help this com- -- the community respond. That's what we're going to do and recover from this disaster. That is our commitment. That's what you've heard from this president. That's what you heard from the FEMA administrator and so many others in the president's administration, and certainly that means ensuring that Americans' have -- voices are heard this November. And so, that is our commitment. We want to make sure that people's voices are heard.
And so, any specifics on where the infrastructure is and what that looks like, certainly, I would have to refer you to the state election officials on -- on those and -- and cybersecurity and infrastructure and all of those pieces -- on what that looks like for them. But -- but --
Q: Have any of the states voiced concerns to the administration?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I -- well, I cannot speak to that. I have not heard of that.
But look, our commitment, again, is to make sure that the resources available so that community can respond to recovery and also get back on their feet and deal with this disaster. We want to make sure -- we want to make sure that Americans' voices are heard this -- this November.
That is im- -- important and so -- but certainly that is something that state elected officials can speak to more directly, but we're going to try and make sure they get back on -- back on that.
And I haven't called on you yet. Go ahead.
Q: Thank you.
Q: Former President Trump is accusing the Biden administration of using FEMA funding to support undocumented migrants. How is the White House responding to that?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, it's just categorically fla- -- false. It is not true. It is a false statement. And look, the fact of the matter is -- I think the Washington Post fact-checker did a piece and the headline recently, just moments ago, not too long ago, and the headline was ""No, Biden didn't take FEMA relief money to use -- to use on migrants - but Trump did.""
I'll leave it there.
Q: And a quick follow-up --
Q: Karine? Karine?
Q: -- on that? A follow on --
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yep. Yep. Yep.
Q: Secretary Mayorkas had said earlier this week that he was concerned that FEMA didn't have enough funding until the end -- for the rest of the hurricane season. Now that President Biden has seen the damage firsthand in the Carolinas, Florida, Georgia -- we heard him say at the podium he may have to call Congress back from recess -- what exactly is he waiting for to be able to make that call?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I -- look, here's the thing: We put forth a pretty substantial, robust -- I mentioned this moments ago -- to be part of the CR. We were disappointed that it was not part of the CR. And if congressional Republicans were serious -- if they were really, truly serious -- about doing something for the communities that was impacted by Hurricane Helene, they would join us in calling for additional funding. This is what we've been doing. And so, if they're serious, they would get to -- to work and get that done.
Just like in the -- with the border, if they were serious about the border, they wouldn't vote against their own bipartisan proposal that they worked with us on -- they're against it now; they weren't -- they would move it forward. It would actually start fixing the broken system that we're seeing right now.
And, you know, they can -- if they really want to help us in dealing what we're seeing, whether it's at the border or getting more funding for disaster monies that's going to be needed to get into the communities, they should be serious. Congressional Republicans need to get serious here, and they're just not.
Go ahead, Akayla.
Q: Thanks, Karine. Just a quick question on the port strike suspension. Is the White House going to continue to be in touch with ILA to sort of support those negotiations as they continue?
MS. JEAN-PIERRE: I think, look, there's congressional -- congressional -- collective bargaining continues. I think that's really important. That's what we're seeing, and that's what we want to continue to see. And so, we will be in touch as necessary.
But I think what's important is they came up with an agreement. That's because of this president's leadership. And the way to get this done is getting col- -- is continuing that collective bargaining, and we believe that certainly works.
Thanks, everybody. All right. Have a great weekend.
Q: Thank you.

"Oct 07, 2024",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-anniversary-the-october-7-hamas-attacks-against-israel,Statement on the Anniversary of the October 7 Hamas Attacks Against Israel,"""On this day last year, the Sun rose on what was supposed to be a joyous Jewish holiday. By sunset, October 7 had become the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Today marks 1 year of mourning for the more than 1,200 innocent people of all ages, including 46 Americans, massacred in southern Israel by the terrorist group Hamas; 1 year since Hamas committed horrific acts of sexual violence; 1 year since more than 250 innocents were taken hostage, including 12 Americans; 1 year for the survivors carrying wounds, seen and unseen, who will never be the same; and 1 year of a devastating war. On this solemn anniversary, let us bear witness to the unspeakable brutality of the October 7 attacks, but also to the beauty of the lives that were stolen that day.
The October 7 attack brought to the surface painful memories left by millennia of hatred and violence against the Jewish people. That is why, soon after the attack, I became the first American President to visit Israel in a time of war. I made clear then to the people of Israel: You are not alone. One year later, Vice President Harris and I remain fully committed to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist. We support Israel's right to defend itself against attacks from Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and Iran. Last week, at my direction, the United States military once again actively assisted in the successful defense of Israel, helping to defeat an Iranian ballistic missile attack.
Today—and every day—I think of the hostages and their families. I have met the families of the hostages and grieved with them. They have been through hell. My administration has negotiated for the safe release of more than 100 hostages, including Americans. We will never give up until we bring all of the remaining hostages home safely.
I also strongly condemn the vicious surge in anti-Semitism in America and around the world. It is unacceptable. All of us must stand united against anti-Semitism and against hate in all its forms.
I believe that history will also remember October 7 as a dark day for the Palestinian people because of the conflict that Hamas unleashed that day. Far too many civilians have suffered far too much during this year of conflict, and tens of thousands have been killed, a human toll made far worse by terrorists hiding and operating among innocent people. We will not stop working to achieve a cease-fire deal in Gaza that brings the hostages home, allows for a surge in humanitarian aid to ease the suffering on the ground, assures Israel's security, and ends this war. Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve to live in security, dignity, and peace. We also continue to believe that a diplomatic solution across the Israel-Lebanon border region is the only path to restore lasting calm and allow residents on both sides to return safely to their homes.
On this day of remembrance, which also falls during the holiest days of the Jewish calendar, we honor the indomitable spirit of the Jewish people and mourn the victims of October 7. May their memory be a blessing."""
