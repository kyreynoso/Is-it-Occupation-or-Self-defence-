Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise in support of 
condemning the outrageous Hamas terrorist attacks that have resulted in 
the senseless deaths of Israelis, Palestinians, and more than 20 
American citizens. Hundreds are missing and many are feared to be held 
hostage--including women, children, and even infants.
  Savagely attacking and killing innocent civilians is never justified. 
These crimes must be unequivocally condemned as they are clear 
violations of international human rights law.
  Hamas has a singular goal: to destroy Israel. Their attacks were not 
targeting the military or government; they were perpetrated against 
Israeli communities for the goal of destruction. Hamas uses fear, 
terror, and intimidation against Israelis and it uses the same tactics 
against the Palestinian people, putting targets on the backs of 
innocent people in Gaza. Nearly half of the population of Gaza are 
children--most having lived their entire lives under a brutal, 
devastating blockade that deprives them of basic human necessities and 
no prospect for a better future.
  I have a solemn responsibility as a Member of Congress to shape 
policy. I have spoken out against governments, extremist groups, those 
exerting power over marginalized populations--whether they are our 
enemies, our allies, or within our own nation--and I always speak up 
for those suffering and in defense of human rights. The October 7 
attack by Hamas was a gross violation of human rights. It crossed a red 
line.
  This was a strategic, coordinated, multi-modal attack by Hamas. It 
leaves deeply concerning questions about what happened in the lead-up 
to this massacre and what the future holds. Any response must consider 
the innocent lives at stake. The United States must not choose to 
escalate conflict with a knee-jerk reaction of providing more weapons 
for an offensive that will certainly take the lives of more innocent 
civilians and children. The reports of casualties in Israel and 
Palestine are stunning, and I fear these numbers will only grow in the 
coming days.
  This attack is not a far-away matter; it is hitting close to home. 
Mothers, fathers, the young, and the elderly--those near and far--are 
now living in unimaginable fear while mourning those they have lost. I 
am hearing from many Jewish constituents and community leaders who are 
in pain and who have loved ones among the injured, killed, or missing. 
I stand with them, I mourn with them, and I share their fear of what is 
to come.
  My hope and my dream for the future is for every Israeli child and 
every Palestinian child to be tucked into bed at night by their parents 
without fear of bombings and perpetual violence. All people deserve 
safety and security--and in the wake of this heinous attack, the 
international community is in agreement that Hamas must be stopped. The 
only sustainable path forward is one where international human rights 
and international law are at the forefront and democratic ideals are 
upheld."

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, since the Senate last convened, 
terrorists have sent shock waves through the civilized world with 
savage, cold-blooded violence.
  On October 7, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic jihad desecrated Israel's 
soil and tore apart Israeli families with utterly medieval brutality. 
Like ISIS, terrorists from Gaza turned peaceful homes and neighborhoods 
in Israel into blood-soaked war zones. It was the deadliest attack on 
the Israelis and on American citizens overseas in decades.
  But now, reports and images of these horrific scenes have spread 
widely. Accounts of Israeli women tortured and raped, of elders 
kidnapped, of charred corpses, beheadings, of children shot dead in 
their homes have shaken peaceful people to their cores. In one kibbutz, 
a paramedic named Amit was working to save the lives of victims pouring 
into a local clinic when she documented what would be the last moments 
of her own life in messages to her sister. Here is what she said: 
``They are here. I don't think I will get out of here alive. Be strong 
if something happens to me.''
  A few minutes later, in a call from Amit's phone, all her sister 
could hear were gunshots and screams. One in 10 residents of the 
community were slaughtered by the terrorists.
  Here is how one retired senior IDF commander put it after he ran to 
rejoin Israel's defense efforts: ``I've heard during my childhood about 
pogroms in Europe, the Holocaust, of course. All my family came from 
Europe. They are survivors, but I never thought I would see things like 
this.''

  Madam President, the people of Israel are grieving unimaginable 
horrors, and we have a responsibility not to look away--not least 
because the same news that has shaken the civilized world to its core 
has emboldened anti-Semites and terrorist sympathizers across the 
globe. We have seen thousands of demonstrators cheer on terrorist 
violence from the streets of Western cities.
  In London, many Jewish children were kept home from school on Friday 
out of fears for their safety. In Chicago, a bomb threat forced a local 
synagogue to evacuate. In Sydney, Australia, a supposedly pro-
Palestinian gathering devolved into a sickening flashback to the worst 
stain on the last century of human history as demonstrators chanted: 
``Gas the Jews.'' And on college campuses across America, leftist 
student groups cloaked vile anti-Semitism in a thin veneer of 
performative, woke jargon.
  So, Madam President, friends of Israel simply cannot afford to be 
silent. And as Israel's closest ally, the United States must lead by 
our example in supporting its efforts to defend itself for as long as 
it takes. As I outlined over the State work period, this means loudly 
and clearly distinguishing between the aggressor and the victim in this 
war. No matter how many voices in the media attempt to ``both-sides'' a 
terrorist attack, there is simply no moral equivalence here.
  Responsibility for the murder of Israelis lies with the terrorists 
who pulled the trigger and the regime that arms and trains them, and 
responsibility for the suffering of the Palestinian people lies with 
the Hamas terrorists who consolidated power by flinging rival civilian 
officials off of rooftops, who use scarce building supplies to dig 
terror tunnels, to turn drinking water pipes into rocket launchers, and 
who use residents of Gaza as human shields.
  Make no mistake, the surest way to stop violence against Israelis and 
oppression of Palestinians is to wipe the terrorists like Hamas from 
the face of the Earth. To that end, the United States must continue to 
provide maximum support to Israel's counterterrorist operation as long 
as it takes. And just as importantly, we have to reestablish deterrence 
against the Iranian regime that not only directly threatens American's 
interest in a peaceful and stable Middle East, but also bears the blood 
of hundreds of Americans and plots to kill even more.
  America's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the desperate 
pursuit of a new nuclear deal, and the failure to respond decisively to 
attacks on U.S. forces in Syria have weakened our deterrence against 
the world's largest state sponsor of terror. America's weakness left 
our allies and partners with serious questions about the credibility of 
our commitments. And if we fail to present clear and devastating 
consequences of further violence against America, as well as our 
friends in Israel, we will make deterring an even bigger strategic 
adversary in Asia even more difficult.
  Reestablishing effective deterrence means investing in American 
military strength. It means investing in an industrial base that is 
capable of equipping both U.S. forces and our allies and partners to 
meet authoritarian oppression in Europe, in Asia, and in the Middle 
East, and it means responding to challenges with credible and 
unflinching resolve. This is a fundamental responsibility of governing. 
Full stop.
  I will have more to say in the coming days, but for right now, this 
is not merely a terrorist war against Israel. It is part of a clear and 
present danger to the United States and the entire civilized world.
  This, Madam President, is a time for choosing. As Israel works to 
eliminate the terrorists who threaten its existence, the United States 
must reaffirm our commitment to Israel's security, and we must continue 
to demonstrate by our leadership that no country should offer safe 
haven to those who aid and abet terror.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, well, we all know what has happened 
since October 7. Hamas has launched more than 6,000 rockets into 
Israel. They have sent more than 1,000 terrorists across the border to 
murder civilians. This is the most devastating slaughter of Jews since 
the Holocaust. They have killed more than 1,400 Israelis; 291 of them 
have been soldiers. They have taken 199 hostages, including an unknown 
number of Americans. This was also one of the deadliest terrorist 
attacks in our history. They killed 30 U.S. citizens, and 13 are still 
missing or are unaccounted for.
  Israel is the victim. Even the Biden White House has acknowledged 
that. This hasn't stopped several of my Democratic colleagues from 
calling for a cease-fire. All of this, also, has not stopped Black 
Lives Matter and other pro-Palestinian groups from glorifying the mass 
slaughter of Jews.
  Students for Justice, in Palestine, called it a ``historic win.''
  Jews in New York, Atlanta, Washington, DC, London, Berlin, and so 
many other cities around the globe are once again living in fear.
  Just this weekend, protesters in Nashville, TN, refused to condemn 
the horrific violence against the Israelis. Instead, they insisted that 
these innocent people had it coming because their government's politics 
don't line up with the radical left's talking points.
  This is, indeed, insanity. If we allow these positions to define our 
foreign policy, we put the lives of Israelis and Americans and our 
allies in danger.
  The United States designated Hamas as a foreign terrorist 
organization in

[[Page S4970]]

1997. Their stated goal is to destroy the State of Israel through 
jihad. Over the years, we have seen them commit acts of violence so 
depraved that allies to the so-called Palestinian cause deny them 
entirely rather than attempt to rationalize them. We know, right now, 
that 600,000 Gazans have been evacuated but that they have trapped more 
than enough women and children to use as human shields. Absolutely 
despicable.
  We also know that they use international aid money not for 
humanitarian aid but to fund their efforts, their war efforts--their 
jihad. Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism and sends 
$100 million annually to Hamas. That is in addition to supplying them 
with technology, logistical support, and weapons.
  When the Biden administration announced their plan to give the 
Iranians access to $6 billion in frozen assets, we knew exactly what 
that meant for Israel. The constant refrain from the Biden 
administration is that there is ``no direct link to Iran regarding this 
attack.'' It is time for whomever wrote that talking point to turn on 
the news, to look at the pictures that are on the screen, to listen to 
what you are hearing from the Ayatollah and some of the Iranian 
officials who are, by the way, meeting with Hamas leadership in Qatar.
  In the first hours of the attack, the Biden administration projected 
nothing but weakness. They deleted multiple tweets calling for a cease-
fire. It took the President almost 12 hours to make a statement. This 
sent a very clear message to our enemies. It also sends a message to 
our allies.
  We can start by giving Israel what they need to eradicate these 
terrorists. Last week, I sent a letter urging President Biden to 
support Israel in all possible ways. Under President Trump, we cut aid 
to the Palestinians because the Palestinian Authority used that money 
to reward terrorism. In 2021, President Biden reversed that policy, and 
since then, he has sent more than $730 million to the Palestinians, 
even though he knows there is a high risk. We know money is fungible, 
and we know what Iran does with their money--they fund terrorism; they 
fund their proxies.
  And, while we are at it, let's start treating Iran like the dangerous 
state sponsor of terror it is. Last week, I led 19 Senate Republicans, 
in a letter, calling on President Biden to permanently freeze Iran's 
access to that $6 billion. We should send those dollars to Israel to 
pay for the damage that Hamas has done. There should be no more 
backdoor deals with Qatar, no more silent agreements, no more quiet 
agreements. Let's have a formal agreement that will stop the 
backpedaling and will stop the intentions to release that money, which 
is what they will do when the media attention on this issue dissipates.
  None of this will matter if we don't root out the incompetence and 
malicious influence in our own government. Last week, I sent a letter 
to President Biden demanding the immediate removal of Jake Sullivan as 
his National Security Advisor. He was wrong about Afghanistan, the 
Middle East, and that nuclear deal with Iran in 2015. He has got to go, 
as do the Iranian assets that President Biden has given top secret 
security clearances to.
  Last month, I stood right here and described how President Biden sent 
Robert Malley, Ariane Tabatabai, and other operatives to negotiate the 
failed Iran nuclear deal. Now, Mr. Malley and Ms. Tabatabai have been 
involved with the Iran Experts Initiative, and then the President gave 
them top secret security clearances and sent them to negotiate on the 
Iran deal. This has to stop.
  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be 
printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                                Congress of the United States,

                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 2023.
     President Joseph R. Biden,
     The White House,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. President: We write today to express our 
     unwavering support for Israel, our greatest ally in the 
     Middle East, and our outrage at your administration's failed 
     leadership on the international stage.
       Israel is at war. Yesterday, Hamas, the Iran-backed 
     Palestinian terrorist group, launched an unprecedented and 
     coordinated land, air, and sea attack against Israel. This 
     occurred during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, the day 
     after the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, and on 
     Shabbat--a day of rest and peace for Jews around the world. 
     Terrorists have infiltrated Israel, taking innocent Israeli 
     civilians and servicemembers hostage. Hundreds of Israelis 
     have died, and the fighting has not ceased.
       This violent attack deserves a strong, unequivocal 
     condemnation by the United States. Instead, while the attacks 
     persisted and Israel was threatened, your administration 
     initially issued a statement calling on Israel to ``refrain 
     from violence.'' So far, the administration's response has 
     been far weaker than Israel--a shining beacon of democracy 
     and our most important ally in the Middle East--deserves.
       While this is not the first act of aggression by the Hamas 
     terrorists against one of our greatest allies, it is 
     certainly the boldest. The failures of this administration on 
     the world stage have no doubt emboldened those who would wish 
     America and our allies harm. Reports indicate that U.S. arms 
     abandoned during the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal ended 
     up in Hamas' hands. This terrorist organization is also 
     funded by the Iranian regime, the world's largest state 
     sponsor of terrorism, whose coffers this administration has 
     filled with over $6 billion in sanctions relief. Indeed, 
     recent reports have revealed the existence of the Iran 
     Experts Initiative (IEI), an Iranian regime-backed foreign 
     influence network. Included among the network's membership is 
     Ariane Tabatabai, now chief of staff to the Assistant 
     Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity 
     Conflict, along with other close contacts of your Special 
     Envoy for Iran, Robert Malley--whose security clearance the 
     State Department suspended earlier this year and who is now 
     subject to an FBI investigation for his alleged mishandling 
     of classified information. The world needs American 
     leadership, and this administration has left a void that the 
     New Axis of Evil and terrorist groups like Hamas have already 
     begun exploiting.
       Over 75 years ago, the United States was the first nation 
     to recognize the Jewish state of Israel and affirm its right 
     to exist. Now, in the face of senseless attacks by Iran-
     backed Hamas terrorists, we must again stand with Israel and 
     reaffirm its right to defend itself. The United States of 
     America does not abandon its friends. We urge this 
     administration to support Israel however possible, including 
     by providing any and all weapons and munitions necessary, and 
     to punish the terrorists who did this, along with those who 
     aid them. We must act swiftly and strongly."

  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam President, I stand again in support of 
our great ally Israel.
  The terror and devastation unleashed on Israel by Iran-backed Hamas 
terrorists has rightly horrified the world. What I am about to describe 
is difficult to say and uncomfortable to hear, but it has to be said on 
the Senate floor. We cannot make this stuff up. The world must know the 
atrocities that have occurred in Israel.
  On the morning of Saturday, October 7, 2023, as families rose to 
start a new day, make breakfast, or slowly wake up in their beds, 
terror approached. Innocent families were murdered in their homes. 
Babies were killed. Innocent, little babies were murdered, and some 
were ruthlessly beheaded. Children were burned alive. Teenage girls 
were raped and then burned alive. An elderly, wheelchair-bound woman, 
who was later identified as a Holocaust survivor, was brutally dragged 
through the streets of Gaza. Children who witnessed the murders of 
their parents were kidnapped and are now being held hostage by Hamas. 
More than 250 young people were savagely murdered while attending a 
music festival in southern Israel--many shot in the back as they tried 
to run away.
  At least 31 Americans--31 Americans--have been killed. More than 
1,400 innocent people were killed in Israel, and we have no idea how 
many are being held hostage by Iran-backed Hamas terrorists in Gaza. 
The atrocities are too numerous to fully recount, but the images seen 
will never leave our memories.
  I was sent a photo of Kfar Aza. I visited this kibbutz during a trip 
to Israel

[[Page S5073]]

with AIPAC in 2019. At the time, it was full of happy families and 
children, but it is now silenced by brutality and death.
  This week, I talked to the individual who gave me the tour of the 
village, or the kibbutz. It was a beautiful place, with nice people--
happy. I was told she is only alive because she was not there. She told 
me the family who lived next door to her on the right was murdered, 
that the family on her left was murdered, and that the family down the 
street was murdered. I was told that the Hamas terrorists set fires to 
force people out of their homes and safe rooms, and they savagely 
murdered innocent Israelis--many shot at close range. She told me that 
she was talking to her sister, who was in a safe room, and the Hamas 
terrorists were trying to break in. Fortunately, they weren't able to.
  Children were shot in front of their parents, and some have been 
kidnapped to Gaza. Iran-backed Hamas terrorists slaughtered the 
innocent babies in their beds. I met so many happy people there just a 
few short years ago. Now I fear a lot of them are going to be dead.
  We saw FOX News correspondent Trey Yingst report:

       Bodies litter the town of Be'eri. You can see here it's 
     complete and total destruction. All of the houses are 
     destroyed. It looks like many were blown up with RPGs or 
     other explosives. People were shot and killed in their beds, 
     executed at point blank range. This is the most horrific 
     thing I have ever seen.

  Thomas Hand is the father of Emily, an 8-year-old girl who was killed 
by Hamas in Be'eri. Thomas had to wait 2 days before he found out that 
Emily was killed.
  I am the father of two daughters and am the grandfather of seven 
grandchildren. Watching this father speak about the murder of his 
daughter is heart-wrenching.
  He said to CNN:

       They just said we found Emily, and she's dead. And I went 
     ``Yes!'' And I smiled.

  This is what he said.
  He said:

       I smiled because that is the best news of the possibilities 
     that I knew. . . . She was either dead or in Gaza.

  He said:

       And, if you know anything about what they do to people in 
     Gaza, that is worse than death.

  Do you know why they murdered Emily and more than 1,400 other 
Israelis and 31 Americans that these Iran-backed Hamas killers 
slaughtered? Simply because they were Jewish. They killed them because 
they hate Jews and want to kill every Jew.
  It is unimaginable what these families have suffered. We cannot look 
away. Let's remember these were Israeli and American families. The 
atrocities are too numerous to fully recount, but these stories and the 
images we have all seen will never leave our memories.
  Not since the Holocaust has the world witnessed such a brutal attack 
on the Jewish people. Sadly, the Jewish people have endured thousands 
of years of hate and persecution, but this will not be the end of 
Israel or the Jewish people.
  Israel is surrounded by terrorist groups that want it wiped off the 
face of the Earth. I have seen this firsthand during my five visits to 
Israel, which has given me a clear perspective on Israel's proximity to 
its enemies Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, and Iran.
  I want to be clear: Hamas and Hezbollah are not religious groups. 
They are not on a noble political quest for liberty or civil justice. 
They are terrorist thugs, and they are killers. They are killers who 
seek to eradicate the Jewish people from this Earth, and they are 
funded and supported by the evil Iranian regime.
  In August 2021, the Senate voted 99 to 0 for my amendment to a budget 
bill to ensure that U.S. tax dollars do not benefit terrorist 
organizations such as Hamas. The vote was 99 to 0. Everyone in this 
body agrees American taxpayers should never fund Hamas terrorists. 
Unfortunately, the final text of the bill did not include my language, 
necessitating further action today.
  Here is why we need the Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act. In 2021, 
Biden's State Department said:

       We're going to be working in partnership with the United 
     Nations and the Palestinian Authority to kind of channel aid 
     there in a manner that does its best to go to the people of 
     Gaza.

  The official went on to say:

       As we've seen in life--as we all know in life--there are no 
     guarantees, but we're going to do everything that we can to 
     ensure that this assistance reaches the people who need it 
     the most.

  We all know that Hamas controls Gaza. Every dollar that goes to Gaza 
comes under the control of Hamas, who decides what it is going to do 
with it.
  So what I heard from the Biden State Department in 2021 is that the 
administration can't guarantee that American taxpayer dollars aren't 
going to fund terrorists in Hamas. The Biden administration thinks the 
risk of resources going to Hamas terrorists is OK because, in life, 
``there are no guarantees.''
  I reject that, and I will not leave anything to chance when it comes 
to preventing U.S. taxpayer money from being sent to the brutal 
terrorists who have slaughtered so many Israelis and Americans.
  And we know for a fact that Hamas uses humanitarian aid to support 
its terrorist attacks. Look at this one. This is a humanitarian 
package. It is a humanitarian UNICEF bag that was found among the 
trucks used to carry Iran-backed Hamas terrorists into Israeli towns 
where they brutally murdered innocent families and burned homes to the 
ground. I guess there was no guarantee.
  I have talked to a lot of rabbis in Florida. We have a lot of 
synagogues there. They told me that they have seen lots of pictures on 
Israeli TV of humanitarian rice bags and that, when people opened them, 
there were bullets in them.
  The administration must do better and fully control where American 
taxpayer money is going. We can. We can make sure American taxpayers 
aren't funding terrorists. That is why I am again asking that we pass 
the Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act. I am proud to have the support 
of Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith, Mike Braun, Kevin Cramer, and Ted Budd on 
this bill.
  What this bill says--it is common sense--is that no funds will be 
authorized for the territory of Gaza until the President certifies to 
Congress that these funds can be spent without benefitting terrorist 
organizations.
  The Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act also ensures that U.S. funds 
are not authorized for expenditure in the territory of Gaza through any 
United Nations entity or office unless the President can certify that 
it is not encouraging or teaching anti-Israel and anti-Semitic ideas 
and propaganda. It is pretty basic.
  Finally, this bill mandates that the President certify that there are 
no hostages--and we know there are hostages in Gaza--being held in Gaza 
by any terrorist organization.
  Just this morning, President Biden announced $100 million of U.S. aid 
for Gaza and the West Bank. While Iran-backed Hamas terrorists continue 
attacks against Israel and hold American hostages in Gaza, I cannot 
think of a more critical time to pass this bill.
  Let me just finish with something that somebody reminded me of today.
  I know a family in Florida who lost their sister-in-law and her 
husband, and I think there were two 6-years-olds and a 3-year-old. So 
here is the way it works. They lost their loved ones, but their 
government is going to tax them to give money to the Palestinian 
Authority that gives money to the terrorists who died while killing 
their family. You can't make this stuff up.
  So, I mean, this is a simple bill.
  Let me now turn it over to my colleague from Indiana, Senator Braun.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.
  Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I was on that trip with Senator Scott 
back in, I believe, August of 2019.
  What struck me about that visit, as we went to almost every perimeter 
in Israel, is how they had to be on guard constantly--constantly--to 
keep from having something flying into one of their towns or villages.
  When we did visit the one that Rick referred to, what struck me is 
they had like a big locker by one of the homes that showed all of the 
unique ways--and I think it was the village nearest to the Gaza Strip--
of how many attempts that were made over time. Thank goodness, most of 
them had fallen short, but it gave me the impression that there was 
never a moment of real security.

[[Page S5074]]

  Then we saw how, within those villages, you had to be on guard almost 
100 percent of the time and scurry into a safe room that would disrupt 
the normal pace of your life. Imagine if you had to live under those 
conditions. And here, it has been a long time since anything of this 
magnitude has come along--probably nearly 50 years--but it shows that 
it never ends there.
  When something like this does happen and when we have had legislation 
that looks like it was intended to prevent this and it went through--I 
think, according to the Senator, unanimously--this should be a slam 
dunk in that we would want to make sure that nothing can leak free out 
of any other type of aid that would help something like this either 
persist or happen again.
  If the report in the Wall Street Journal is accurate, Iran was 
closely involved in the planning and execution of the horrible 
terrorist act on Israel. If that is the case, then it appears the $6 
billion in cash, unfrozen for Iran, freed up resources to aid the 
attack. We should suspend those funds immediately and permanently. We 
must also take extra steps to make sure the United States is not 
inadvertently funding terrorist activities. This bill--a simple one--
the Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act, would do just that.
  Under this bill, the President will have to certify that no U.S. 
funds are able to go to Hamas or members of Hamas. It would also make 
sure that funds are not benefiting organizations controlled or 
influenced by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or any other terrorist 
organization. It simply puts in specificity what we all should be for.
  With President Biden's announcement today that he intends to send 
$100 million in aid to Gaza, we need this legislation to become law 
immediately. The American people need to feel confident that their tax 
dollars are not going to fund the mayhem we saw in Israel at the hands 
of Hamas terrorists.
  I yield the floor to the Senator from North Carolina.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.
  Mr. BUDD. Madam President, on October 7, Hamas terrorists launched an 
unprovoked and barbaric series of terrorist attacks inside Israel. Over 
1,400 children, women, and men were brutally murdered. Thirty-one 
Americans were killed, and dozens remain missing or held hostage.
  In the wake of such a despicable series of attacks, we must ensure 
that our taxpayer dollars are not being sent to aid these terrorist 
killers.
  Two years ago, one of our own State Department officials in the Biden 
administration acknowledged the possibility that aid to the 
Palestinians could find its way into Hamas's hands. That is 
unacceptable.
  That is why Senator Rick Scott's Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act 
is so critical right now. It simply states that no U.S. taxpayer 
dollars would be authorized to Gaza until the President certifies to 
us, to Congress, that there are measures in place to prevent any 
taxpayer dollars from benefiting terrorist organizations.
  At the end of the day, we should be standing shoulder to shoulder 
with the State of Israel to give them everything that they need to 
destroy Hamas.
  I urge the Senate to pass this without delay.
  I thank my colleague from Florida for his leadership on this issue, 
and I yield to him.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.
  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam President, I thank my colleagues Senator 
Braun and Senator Budd for joining me here on the Senate floor to pass 
this important legislation.
  You know, the individual who gave me the tour of the kibbutz--she was 
telling me that they were just half a mile from Gaza, and before Hamas 
took over the Gaza area, she used to be able to walk all the way to the 
beach, and it was safe.
  I think most people in America--no one is against Gazans, but to take 
any chance that our money goes to Hamas before or after this doesn't 
make any sense.
  I think every single Member of this body can agree that the United 
States shouldn't allow a single dollar of taxpayer money to get into 
the hands of terrorists--funding that is being used to kill innocent 
Israelis and Americans and hold our citizens and others hostage.
  I look forward to my colleagues joining me today.
  I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be 
discharged from further consideration of S. 489 and the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration. I further ask that the Scott of Florida 
substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; the bill, 
as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?
  Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right to object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.
  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I listened carefully to what Senator 
Scott and others have said about the barbarous acts committed by Hamas 
against innocent men, women, and children--the mowing down by machine 
guns of young people who were doing nothing more than attending a 
dance; the murder of babies. This is a horrific--horrific--act, 
precipitating a worldwide crisis, and the United States of America--all 
of us--condemn this act.
  In my view, the State of Israel has the absolute right to defend 
itself against Hamas and terrorism in general--no debate on that. But 
what I ask my colleagues to also consider is that while we fully 
appreciate the horrific attack by Hamas against innocent people of 
Israel, I ask you also to understand that right now there are hundreds 
and hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women, and children in Gaza 
who have lost their homes. They have been thrown out of their homes. 
They have no food. They have no water. They have no fuel. And I remind 
my colleagues that half of those people are children. Half of the 
people in Gaza are children. So, yes, we are united in doing everything 
we can to destroy Hamas and their terrorism, but I implore you, do not 
take Hamas's inhumanity and brutality and terrorism against children 
who are 3 or 5 years old.
  I ask you to think for a moment. Think about it. I have a State that 
I represent, the State of Vermont--630,000 people. A million people--
most of them are poor. They had nothing to begin with. Before this 
whole business, Gaza was one of the most desperately poor places in the 
world. Youth unemployment was 75 percent, many of their people 
dependent on the U.N. for basic survival.
  So what I am asking people to take a look at is to understand what 
our country is about, and what our country must not be involved in is 
making the horrific and miserable situation in Gaza even worse.
  Many of the families--and, again, these are people thrown out of 
their homes. They don't know where they are going. They don't know who 
will accept them. They don't know if they are ever going back to their 
homes. And they were poor to begin with. Do we really want to deny 
those people aid from the U.N. and other agencies to feed the children, 
to provide water for them? Is that really what we are about?
  Of course, it goes without saying that we have to do everything we 
can to make sure that not one nickel goes to the murderous Hamas 
organization, but at the same time, we have to stand with the innocent 
women and children in Palestine who are suffering today and are facing 
an almost unprecedented modern humanitarian disaster.
  So today, in the midst of this crisis, U.S. and U.N. assistance in 
Gaza is aimed squarely at addressing the basic needs of the Palestinian 
people, including humanitarian aid and water and health programs. The 
United States and the United Nations go to great lengths to ensure that 
aid gets to the people needed and is not diverted, through trusted 
partners like Catholic Relief Services. The Israeli Government itself 
recognizes the importance of this U.N. humanitarian aid and has long 
supported it.
  Today, in the midst of this horrific crisis, the United States and 
the international community are working to secure humanitarian access--
and from media reports I have seen recently, we may be making some 
progress on that--so that the U.N. can get food and

[[Page S5075]]

water and fuel and medicine to the million or more people in Gaza who 
need essential supplies. That should be our focus. There are people now 
facing hunger, they are facing incredible desperation, and we cannot--
cannot--turn our backs on them.
  If you think this is going to be good for Israel, if you think that 
the suffering of the Palestinian people long term is good for Israel, I 
think you are sorely mistaken.
  The world is looking at us, and the world understands that what Hamas 
did was terrible, but they don't want to see our great country turn its 
back on innocent women and children. That, in my view, is not what this 
country is about.
  This is a tough issue. There have been four wars there in the last 15 
years. It ain't going to be solved tomorrow. But while we do our best 
to support Israel and destroy Hamas, please, let us not turn our backs 
on the suffering people in Gaza.
  This is not what we should be doing, not what Congress should be 
doing, and therefore I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.
  The Senator from Florida.
  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. So I hoped my colleague would change his 
position if he just read what I said. The bill doesn't say that money 
can't go to Gaza; it says that no funds will be authorized for the 
territory of Gaza until the President certifies to Congress that these 
funds can be spent without benefiting terrorist organizations. I don't 
know how anybody can disagree with that. It says that no funds are 
authorized for expenditure in the territory of Gaza through any United 
Nations entity or office unless the President can certify that it is 
not encouraging or teaching anti-Israel and anti-Semitic ideas and 
propaganda.
  So this doesn't say money can't go to Gaza and help Gazans. This bill 
says the President has to ensure that this isn't happening and rice 
bags are not being filled with bullets and we are not having the PLO 
give money to terrorists who killed American citizens or their 
families. That is all this says, is that the money cannot go for the 
benefit of Hamas. So if you disagree with what this says, then you are 
saying money can go to Hamas. I don't know how else you can disagree 
with it. This is so basic.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.
  Mr. SANDERS. The thing is that hundreds of thousands of women and 
children are living in desperation today. And nobody in the world can 
guarantee that a bottle of water may not go to somebody connected to 
Hamas. If you are insistent upon that, what you are really saying is, 
no money for Gaza.
  So, with that, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators, I am going to ask that you direct 
your comments and questions to the Chair.
  The Senator from Vermont, you were recognized. Thank you.
  The Senator from Florida, you are now recognized.
  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam President, let us just remember, what we 
are talking about is, this is not against sending money to Gaza. It is 
saying we have--if we are going to send money, it cannot go for the 
benefit of individuals who murdered babies, raped teenage girls, and 
shot people in their sleep. I mean, I don't know how anybody can ever 
support giving money to Gaza when you know it is going to go to Hamas 
if you are not careful. And that is exactly what this administration 
said.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee."

Madam President, I know that we are all watching what 
is happening with Israel and then also looking at how that affects our 
national security. And in doing this, one of the things we have paid 
attention to is what is happening at our southern border.
  As you look at the numbers there, it really is quite frightening to 
see how people from all across the globe are coming to our southern 
border. Indeed, last year, we had individuals from 176 different 
countries that came to our southern border. Among this number, there 
were hundreds of gang members, there were thousands of convicted 
criminals, and there were individuals of interest--names of interest--
that our Border Patrol watched, and, indeed, there were people on the 
Terrorist Watchlist.
  Last year, in 2023--that is, our fiscal 2023--there were 151 
apprehensions of individuals on the Terrorist Watchlist. Now, this 
number is really quite a dramatic increase. In 2022, there were 98 
individuals on the Terrorist Watchlist who were apprehended at the 
southern border. In 2021, there were 15. And in 2019, there were zero--
not a one.
  Now, as you look at these numbers and as you look at what is 
happening here, it is natural to think: What has caused this uptick in 
terrorists that are coming to our border? If you are going to be honest 
about these numbers, what you would have to do is say: OK, what has 
changed from 2019 to 2021 and 2022 and 2023? And in a sane world--which 
maybe this is not a sane world right now--it would lead you to look at 
this administration's border policies: the ease with which people can 
come to the border, raise their hands, and claim asylum; the way the 
cartels have expanded around the globe as global businesses, indeed, 
moving human trafficking from having been a $500 million-a-year 
business in 2019 to today, this year, $150 billion--``billion'' with a 
B. Those are the numbers that we are dealing with.
  And for terrorists who want to get in this country--and I would say 
it is not a stretch to think they are coming here to do us harm--maybe 
they are saying: It is the easiest way. You can claim asylum. You can 
grab a child and say you are bringing your child to America for a 
better life.
  But the numbers are not my numbers. They are not Republican numbers. 
They are not Senate numbers. These are the numbers that come from the 
Department of Homeland Security. This is what they have logged.
  Now, the other thing that we have to look at is that in fiscal year 
2022, DHS reported that 2.4 million individuals tried to force their 
way across the southern border. And, indeed, we have to say that. And, 
in that, we also have an additional 600,000 ``got-aways.'' Those are 
the ones who can be seen on surveillance but they can't get to.
  Those are pretty hefty numbers, and those are the 2022 numbers. In 
2023, the numbers are even above that. It is impossible to control an 
influx of this magnitude, which means it is also impossible for us to 
control the collective threat that this poses to our country. Because, 
in those ``got-aways,'' how many are terrorists? How many are gang 
members? How many are drug traffickers? How many are sex traffickers? 
How many of those ``got-aways'' are coming to inflict harm on our 
cities, our towns, our communities, and our citizens?
  Now, what has concerned me and what concerns so many Tennesseans--and 
I hear it regularly--last night, I did a cell phone townhall, which I 
enjoy doing and hearing firsthand from Tennesseans, spending an hour 
taking questions, answering their questions. And what really bothers so 
many of them is our President and his administration's unwillingness to 
acknowledge the very existence of the threats that that open border 
brings to us. It jeopardizes our safety and our security and, I would 
say, even the security of our allies.
  We have got a lot of adversaries in this world. We all know that. 
When you look at Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, we know we have got 
adversaries. You look at what is happening with Hamas in Israel, in 
those horrific attacks there. And we can say our adversaries may be 
sadistic, but they are not stupid. They know the border is open.
  They know that we are practicing--this administration is practicing--
a foreign policy of appeasement. And maybe that is the reason that even 
this month what you saw was 2,000 Chinese, 100 Russians, 35 Pakistanis, 
and 30 Iranians coming to our southern border; coming in the country 
illegally; coming, saying they are claiming asylum.
  Does this make us safer? No, it doesn't, when you do not know who is 
coming into this country and their intent.
  Now, Hamas has noted the confusion in our foreign policy and the lack 
of clarity. They saw it when President Biden withdrew troops from the

[[Page S5076]]

CENTCOM area. They saw it. So what we did when we withdrew those troops 
was, effectively, to leave Israel surrounded by their worst enemies.
  They have also noted Biden's record of appeasing hostile regimes. 
When Biden chose not to enforce--and this is important to note--this 
administration, this National Security Director, this President chose 
not to enforce oil sanctions against Iran. They did this knowing this 
would end up benefiting Hamas, Hezbollah, and the terrorist groups that 
are the proxies for Iran.
  The President also knew that $6 billion in a ransom payment would 
free up even more money for terrorist groups, more money for Hamas, 
more money for Hezbollah. That is the hallmark of this administration: 
looking the other way, appeasing Iran, and doing it at cost to the 
American people. Since 2021, President Biden has funneled $730 million 
to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees.
  Now, this agency, which has been around for decades, what they have 
become is a ferociously anti-Semitic organization that has a long 
history of employing people that--guess what--they are associated with 
Hamas. And Hamas has a history of stealing money from this agency and 
using the agency's facilities to store weapons.
  Now, does that sound like humanitarian aid? Does that sound like 
money going to the purpose for which it was given? Of course not. And 
that is why, in 2018, President Trump halted the funding to the U.N. 
Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees.
  Well, President Biden comes in and guess what he does. He turned that 
spigot back on, running wide open, even though he knew it was pretty 
much as good as writing a check to Hamas, a terrorist organization. 
And, by the way, we declared and recognized Hamas as a terrorist 
organization. We as a country did this in 1997.
  So, you know, there are things we can do. And I have introduced 
legislation to halt funding to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for 
Palestine Refugees until Iran is expelled from the U.N. and until we 
investigate their crimes--what they are doing with this money, how it 
leads to death and destruction--because they are giving it to these 
terrorist organizations.
  Iran gives Hamas about $100 million a year--$100 million. They also 
provide them with the weapons and armor and ammo and with supplies and 
training. We also know that Hamas has grabbed aid this week for State 
kits, medical supplies, food. It is not going to the people, the 
Palestinians; it is going to Hamas for their efforts.
  Now, in the first 2 weeks of fiscal year 2024, Border Patrol captured 
30 Iranians, as I said a few minutes ago. Now, they were trying to come 
across the southern border; two of them, Terrorist Watchlist. Now, this 
is this month. This is in the last couple of weeks. And we have gotten 
reports of at least two more Iranians on that Terrorist Watchlist that 
have tried to come in.
  So since last Monday alone--Monday a week ago--we have had 19 
Iranians and 17 Syrians that tried to sneak into this country over the 
southern border.
  So I would just ask my colleagues, my Democratic colleagues: Why do 
you think the terrorists--why do you think these people feel so 
emboldened? Whether it is the Iranians, the Pakistanis, the Russians, 
the Chinese, why are they flooding to our border to gain illegal entry 
into our country to evade our immigration laws, to fly under the cloak 
of darkness and get in here on U.S. soil? Why are they emboldened? Does 
this not worry you? Does this not cause you to say it is an imperative 
that we secure this border?
  You know, right now, as we have looked at what is happening around 
the globe and, specifically, as we look at what has happened in Israel, 
you have got 1,400 Israelis who are dead; you have got 31 Americans who 
are dead; you have got individuals from dozens of other countries 
around the globe who are dead, who are injured, who have been taken 
hostage and have faced a horrific circumstance. We cannot let this 
pattern of neglect continue in our country. We cannot continue to make 
our Nation and our citizens vulnerable. We cannot let attacks happen on 
our soil. It is time that we close that southern border.
  I yield the floor.

Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7. The wanton slaughter of 
more than a thousand Israelis and an estimated 200 hostages still being 
held is hard to fathom. One fact tells the grim story. More Jews died 
on this day than any time since the Holocaust. It was not just another 
bad day in the Middle East. It was a premeditated slaughter of historic 
proportion.
  The crisis that has followed has touched many in my home State of 
Illinois who have family in Israel. On Friday, I was relieved to learn 
of the release of Natalie and Judith Raanan from Evanston who were 
being held as hostages by Hamas in Gaza. Another two women, thankfully, 
were released yesterday. Now the Hamas terrorists must release the 
remaining hostages captured on October 7. I pray every moment for their 
safe return.
  Throughout my career in Congress, I have supported U.S. assistance to 
help Israel defend itself from those bent on its destruction. I am not 
naive. I know the creation of the nation of Israel was controversial in 
its time. It still is to many today. Yet it struck me that the people 
of that region deserve an opportunity to live in peace, to find one 
refuge in the world they can count on. And I have always supported 
Israel because of that.
  I will strongly support the President's proposed supplemental request 
to help Israel, Ukraine, and other urgent humanitarian needs.
  The Hamas attack, which had nothing to do with solving the problems 
between the Jewish people and the Palestinians, was really not 
advancing a two-state solution or even seeking long-term peace. It was 
a reminder that there are still those in the region who refuse to 
accept Israel's right to exist--literally, their right to exist--and 
will take any actions to destroy it.
  But in acknowledging Israel's understandable rage and pain, I believe 
President Biden gave wise counsel to learn from America's mistakes made 
after the similarly traumatic attacks on 9/11. I remember that day. I 
was in this building, just outside the Chamber, 9/11/2001. I couldn't 
imagine what had happened to our Nation as we were evacuating the 
Capitol to stand out on the lawn and pray another airplane was not 
directed toward the Capitol or the White House.
  It changed America in some ways for the better. We were united. We 
were determined. We were really in focus with one another to try to 
make this a safe country for our kids and grandkids. And it divided us 
as well. We made some decisions which were thoughtful, wise, and stood 
the test of history and some that did not.
  Hamas, just like al-Qaida in those days, must be destroyed. But 
Israel should be wary of the kind of overreach we found after 9/11. You 
do not want an ill-thought occupation of Gaza to become your Fallujah. 
You do not want to dehumanize the innocents on the periphery who are 
not your enemy and will have to be your neighbors in the future.
  Hamas is a terrorist organization that has a long and cynical history 
of hiding its military essence among and around innocent civilians. 
They dare their enemies to attack, only to realize the collateral 
damage is going to be devastating. It makes any effort to root them out 
and rescue hostages extraordinarily difficult.
  Let us be clear, the Palestinian people are not Hamas. As a 
democracy, Israel must follow the rules of war and not target civilians 
or conduct disproportionate or indiscriminate attacks. We are already 
seeing a distressing humanitarian crisis building in Gaza, which has 
the potential to become worse.

  As such, I joined several Senate colleagues in calling for the U.S. 
humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people, a move President 
Biden made last week. The suffering of the Palestinians cannot be 
ignored. Tom Freidman said it even better last week when he said:

       Hamas has not only taken [Israel] hostage; it has taken 
     [Gaza civilians] hostage as well.

  The passions and pain from these events are not limited to the Middle 
East. They are manifesting in all of our Nation, even in my State of 
Illinois. Ten days ago, a 6-year-old Palestinian-American, Wadea Al-
Fayoume, was murdered in a suburb of Chicago in a mindless, 
heartbreaking act. Almost

[[Page S5133]]

every hour of every day, there has been a photograph of this beautiful 
little boy in a ``Happy Birthday'' hat standing, smiling, looking at 
the camera. It is hard to imagine he answered his door, and simply 
because he was a Palestinian descendant, he was attacked by a crazed 
man who killed him and then attempted to kill his mother. I was glad 
President Biden mentioned Wadea last week in an address to the Nation. 
I have that family in my thoughts and prayers as they grieve for the 
little boy and the mother who continues to recover. There have also 
been fears of a bomb threat at a synagogue outside of Chicago. A 
weekend protest in Skokie ended in shots fired.
  President Biden was eloquent when he reminded us such hate must stop 
and we are all Americans. I have my differences with George W. Bush, 
but I think one of the most profound things he said or did after 9/11 
was to announce publicly that he did not believe those who believed in 
the Muslim faith were wrong at the heart. He believed that it was a 
religion of peace that some were trying to corrupt. Those statements 
were so critical at the time when hatred could line up at just any 
moment. Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and anti-Arab hate have no place 
in America or anywhere in the world.
  During my time in Congress, I have been an advocate of a two-state 
solution, one that provides safe and secure nations for both the 
Israeli and Palestinian people. There have been attempts at peace and 
two states offered some hope--Israeli peace with Egypt and Jordan, and 
the Oslo Accords.
  Some leaders, such as former Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and 
Egyptian President Sadat paid with their lives pursuing peace. But for 
too long, spoilers on both sides undermined a peaceful two-state 
solution. They pursued narrow, selfish political goals, too often 
determined to stay in power above all else. Settlements have expanded, 
as have continued eruptions of violence.
  Regional powers have claimed to care about but only paid lip service 
to the Palestinian people. The Palestinian authority has been mired in 
corruption and a lack of new leadership for more than two decades, too 
often at the very expense of the Palestinian people.
  I know it will be hard, but I hope out of the ashes of pain of this 
crisis, there will be a renewed focus on a two-state solution. Out of 
the devastating Yom Kippur war came the unimaginable at the time--a 
historic peace treaty between Egypt and Israel that still endures. With 
the right leaders on both sides, it can be done.
  We here in the United States have a responsibility for a renewed push 
towards finding a solution that allows Israel and Palestinian children 
to, once and for all, live together safely and peacefully.
  I yield the floor.
  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, 10 days ago, the family of Omer 
Neutra lit 23 candles on his birthday cake. But unlike previous 
birthdays, the candles kept burning because Omer wasn't there to blow 
them out.
  Omer is one of the more than 200 people in Israel who were taken 
hostage by Hamas. The grandson of Holocaust survivors, he is an avid 
athlete and loves the New York Knicks.
  He deferred his acceptance to Binghamton University to spend a gap 
year in Israel before he joined the IDF. On the day of the attack, he 
was working as a tank commander defending the Gaza border. He was last 
seen being forcibly removed at the hands of Hamas terrorists.
  Since Omer's abduction, my office has been working with his family. 
We are doing everything we can to secure his safe release and the 
release of all the Americans who are still unaccounted for in Israel. I 
am grateful that the two American hostages released on Friday are doing 
well, but there are still several American citizens, many of whom may 
be injured or unwell, who remain in captivity. We must not stop 
fighting until all of them are safe.
  On Thursday, I met with the family of 3-year-old Abigail Mor Edan. 
Her family told me the harrowing story of her and her two siblings. 
Abigail's brother Michael and her sister Amalia locked themselves in a 
closet while their mother was slaughtered in their home. Abigail was 
with her father who was shot while holding on to her. His body was 
later found, but Abigail is still missing.
  I also met with the family of Keith and Aviva Siegel, grandparents 
who were kidnapped from kibbutz Kfar Aza. Keith is an American citizen 
and was seen being abducted with his wife.
  The family of Itay Chen has been in contact with my office too. Itay 
is a 19-year-old who was born in New York City and is now serving in 
the IDF. He was supposed to return home to his family in just a few 
days to celebrate his brother's bar mitzvah.
  Another hostage, named Sagui Dekel-Chen, is a U.S. citizen who was 
last seen fighting off the terrorists. His pregnant wife and two young 
daughters survived while hiding in their family's safe room.
  I have also heard from the family of Judy Weinstein, who was born in 
New York State. She and her husband Gad were on a walk when the air 
raid sirens blared. The couple hid face down in a field as hundreds of 
rockets rained overhead. Judy called an ambulance because she and her 
husband had been shot, but the ambulance was unable to reach them, and 
the couple is now missing.
  None of these people--these innocent people--deserve to be abandoned. 
They are Americans. We must fight for them as if they were our own 
sons, our own daughters, our own grandmothers and grandfathers. These 
people are our family, our lifeblood, our heart and soul.
  My commitment to these families is that we will not give up on them. 
We will go to the ends of the Earth to bring their loved ones home. And 
my message to the terrorists is: We will not give in. Your darkness and 
your evil will not destroy us.
  We will keep our hope alive and rally around these families. We will 
light our loved ones' candles and never blow them out.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 
up to 15 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, last week, the Biden administration 
proposed a spending package that included funding meant for 
humanitarian relief--$3.5 billion for migration and refugee assistance 
in Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza; $5.7 billion for the U.S. Agency for 
International Development. The Biden administration says that our money 
will pay for ``life-saving humanitarian programming in Israel and areas 
impacted by the situation in the West Bank and Gaza.''
  We have two problems to address. First, the U.S. Government is scared 
to call the terrorist attack a terrorist attack. Second, this is just 
one more embarrassing example of the Biden administration's two-faced 
approach to the people of Israel.
  I have spoken at length about the money pipeline between Iran and 
Hamas, but there is a similar pipeline that appears to be running 
between Hamas and the U.S. taxpayer. Every dollar we send that is 
earmarked for Gaza or the West Bank is another dollar Hamas can put 
into their pocket.
  Last week, I spoke about the U.N. Relief and Works Agency and how 
this false humanitarian mission has been corrupted by Hamas and 
terrorist sympathizers. This has been confirmed by multiple NGOs, the 
media, Joe Biden's own advisers, and whoever published and then deleted 
this post from the UNRWA Twitter account.
  Hamas stole those supplies and UNRWA covered it up. Remember, this is 
a U.N. body that pulls 93 percent of its funding from global 
government. In 2021 alone, UNRWA took $338 million from the United 
States, $118 million from the European Commission, and

[[Page S5134]]

hundreds of millions of dollars from individual European nations.
  Since 2021, Biden has sent UNRWA a billion dollars. A billion 
dollars. USAID funds more than $21 billion worth of UN programming, and 
they sent millions of dollars to UNRWA. And now the President is ready 
to send them billions more. If the American people knew what their tax 
dollars were actually being used for, they would be outraged. And I 
believe it is time for them to know.
  We know that Hamas steals UNRWA money and supplies and stores their 
weapons in UNRWA facilities. We also know that they fill those 
facilities with human shields. But something that hasn't gotten nearly 
enough attention is how our tax dollars are radicalizing the next 
generation of Hamas extremists.
  UN Watch published a report in March exposing UNRWA-affiliated 
schools for what they are: indoctrination centers. Bear in mind, this 
is UN Watch that published this report and exposed the U.N. Relief and 
Works Agency for Palestinian refugees for what they were doing. One 
employee shared an Instagram post calling a teenage Palestine Islamic 
Jihad fighter who was killed in a shootout a ``little cub who fights 
like a thousand lions.'' That was an employee of the U.N. Relief and 
Works Agency who shared that Instagram post calling a teenage Jihadi 
fighter a ``little cub who fights like a thousand lions.''
  A teacher posted a picture of Hitler with the caption:

       Hitler, are you sleeping? Wake up, honey, there are still 
     some people you need to burn.

  UN Watch also found official curriculum from last year celebrating 
Dalal Mughrabi. In 1978, she led a band of PLO terrorists in a massacre 
that left 38 Israeli civilians dead. Thirteen of her victims were 
children. Another piece of propaganda written for ninth graders 
described the firebombing of a U.S. bus as a ``barbecue party.'' One 
UNRWA teacher assigned seventh grade boys anti-Semitic poetry that 
urged the students to expel Israelis ``with blood and flesh'' from 
Palestine. All of this was subsidized by the American taxpayer.
  Hamas is responsible for the October 7 massacre in Israel. But anyone 
who believes that Hamas is a solo actor is willfully ignorant. They 
have support. And right now, Biden's foreign policy is providing much 
of that support, not only through the money pipeline but through his 
absolute refusal to keep Iran in check. This isn't just a U.S. problem. 
It is a worldwide problem that we will not solve until the money stops 
flowing and Hamas is eradicated.
  Fortunately, at least when it comes to UNRWA, accountability is built 
in. Global governments provide that funding, which means we can take it 
away. The United States needs to step up and lead.
  I have introduced legislation to halt that funding until Iran is 
expelled from the U.N. and investigated for violations. We have to get 
this job done. Our legislation would accomplish two goals. It will 
destroy that pipeline of taxpayer dollars from the United States to 
Hamas and disrupt the Biden administration's policy of appeasement 
toward Iran.
  Everything President Biden has done has made this world more 
dangerous. But nothing has had more immediate and catastrophic 
consequences for our allies than his refusal to treat the Iranian 
regime like the dangerous adversary that it actually is. He sent Robert 
Malley, Ariane Tabatabai, and other Iranian assets to renegotiate the 
failed nuclear deal. Administration officials allowed Ms. Tabatabai's 
security clearance to stand even after it became clear she was 
operating under the advice of Iranian officials. He agreed to hand over 
a $6 billion ransom payment and then insisted that the world's most 
prolific state sponsor of terror would dedicate every penny to 
humanitarian aid.
  And in the hours following the worst massacre of Jews since the 
Holocaust, he insisted that there was no connection between Iran and 
Hamas and their terrorist acts. Never mind that a week later, Hamas 
leadership met with the Iranian foreign minister in Qatar.
  Biden's foreign policy is fatally flawed; that has become evident. 
And if we don't force him to reverse course, he will further endanger 
the American people and our allies and our safety and security.
  I yield the floor."

Republicans reached an important agreement to move forward on three 
bipartisan--underline bipartisan--appropriations bills: MILCON-VA, 
Agriculture, and Transportation-HUD.
  We will begin voting on amendments as soon as this afternoon and keep 
going through the rest of the week and into the next. It is my hope 
that with bipartisan cooperation, we can wrap up our work on these 
bipartisan appropriations bills sometime next week.
  And this will be the Senate working as it should, both parties 
cooperating, debating amendments, working through differences, without 
grinding the legislative process to a halt. Democrats promised our 
Republican colleagues that their voices would be heard, and we are 
making good on that promise. Forty amendments will be considered, many 
of them bipartisan, on issues ranging from telehealth funding for 
veterans, fixing infrastructure hit by natural disasters, to 
investments in rural America.
  We worked closely with Republicans to put these appropriations bills 
together. If passed, the bills will make a huge difference for American 
farmers, for our infrastructure, for housing, and for our military 
bases and veterans.
  Bipartisanship isn't easy. On the contrary, these days it is 
exceedingly difficult, but we are moving forward thanks to the good 
work of our appropriators, especially Chair Murray and Vice Chair 
Collins. They have set the tone from the start here in the Senate that 
bipartisanship should lead the way.
  It was true in the Appropriations Committee; I hope it remains true 
here on the floor because we are going to need bipartisanship in all 
that we do

[[Page S5156]]

during this time of divided government.
  Bipartisanship will be essential for passing these appropriations 
bills; bipartisanship will be essential for keeping the government open 
in less than a month; and bipartisanship will be essential for passing 
the President's national security request.
  I would say to my colleagues in the House, my Republican colleagues, 
if you try to do things not in a bipartisan way, it is going to lead to 
cul-de-sacs, gridlocks, and other things that hurt the American people.
  Both parties recognize we must support our allies in Israel against 
Hamas. Both parties recognize that we must support our friends in 
Ukraine against Putin. Both parties know that we must fight the scourge 
of fentanyl coming through the border, outcompete the Chinese 
Government, and support Taiwan.
  So to my Republican colleagues, House and Senate, let's work together 
to ensure that passing the supplemental remains bipartisan because only 
things that win support from both sides will make it to the President's 
desk.
  I thank my colleagues on both sides who have shown that 
bipartisanship is still the key to getting things done here in the 
Senate. And, now, because of that bipartisanship, the appropriations 
process is finally--finally--moving forward.; Mr. President, now on another matter, it has been 18 days since the 
brutal terrorist attacks of October 7, 18 days since savages confronted 
the world with the depths of human depravity, since one of the oldest 
forms of hatred in human history reared its ugly head, since radical 
Islamic terrorists reminded us they pose a persistent threat to the 
civilized world.
  In our shock, the West vowed solidarity. We pledged not to look away 
from the horrors Israel was grieving. We reaffirmed Israel's right to 
defend itself, and we promised to stand with our ally as it fought back 
against pure evil.
  But in the last 18 days, silence, amnesia, cowardice, and outright 
hate have begun to take their toll. All too quickly, the West's resolve 
has shown signs of weakness.
  First, we saw the most elite corners of higher education rush to 
blame Israel for the deaths of its own children. We saw college 
administrators tie themselves in grotesque moral knots to avoid 
acknowledging reality, even in the face of alumni revolts.
  Last night, for example, at George Washington University, here in the 
Nation's Capital, student activists projected anti-Semitic messages on 
the side of the campus building named for a pair of Jewish benefactors. 
They issued a call to ``free Palestine from the river to the sea.''
  For anyone unfamiliar with Israel's geography, that is a call for the 
destruction of the Jewish State.
  But, just a few blocks away, the Biden administration is in denial. 
After protestors in Time Square displayed the Nazi swastika and an 
Israeli student at Columbia University was beaten with a stick, the 
White House Press Secretary replied to a question about rising concerns 
of anti-Semitism that ``we have not seen any credible threats.'' That 
is the White House Press Secretary. Even more absurd was how, in the 
very next breath, without even uttering the word ``Jew,'' she pivoted 
abruptly to condemning Islamophobia.

  Seriously, after thousands of Jews have been tortured and murdered, 
after hundreds have been taken hostage, after the sight of Jewish 
bodies paraded through Gaza was met with rejoicing from Arab capitals 
to London--after all of this--President Biden's Press Secretary 
reverted to the disgraceful ``both sides'' talking points.
  Of course, as I have discussed before, the media organizations who 
engage with her deserve their own share of shame. Some in the press are 
already indulging the same tired language designed to sap the free 
world's sense of moral clarity. Headlines are already warning about the 
indiscernible ``cycle of violence'' and amplifying morally bankrupt 
calls for a cease-fire.
  For anyone who needs a reminder, a cease-fire is what Israel thought 
it had with Hamas and with Palestinian Islamic Jihad earlier this 
summer. A cease-fire today is an amnesty for Hamas, a free path for 
terrorists from the same savage tribe as ISIS and al-Qaida.
  So less than 3 weeks after the deadliest slaughter of Jews since the 
Holocaust, too many prominent corners of our society already need a 
reminder--a reminder--of the terrorist horrors that actually started 
the war.
  Yesterday, I welcomed a group of important visitors to my office, 
among them were family members of Israelis being held hostage by Hamas. 
Two had survived the attacks and witnessed the terror firsthand. I 
would like to share with our colleagues two of their stories.
  First was Netta, a 20-year-old student who lived in a kibbutz in 
southern Israel. Netta told me that he woke up on October 7 to the 
sound of sirens. He talked about how he armed himself with a kitchen 
knife, barricaded himself in an interior room, and leaned against the 
door as terrorists ransacked his apartment. Netta told me about how he 
realized hours later, when his mother stopped replying to his texts, 
that his parents had been taken hostage by Hamas.
  I also heard from a young woman named Maya who was at the music 
festival that morning with her friends. Maya described to me yesterday 
the sounds of rockets interrupting the party at sunrise. She described 
how she cried the first time she saw a victim lying in the road as she 
fled, not knowing if he was alive or dead. She recalled how she turned 
left on a road in search of safe haven while many of her friends--two 
of whom would be murdered--turned right. She told me how she called her 
father to say, ``I love you, and I don't know if I will make it out,'' 
and how she waited hours in a kibbutz shelter, assuming that her ``time 
was coming.''
  She remembers how news spread in message groups about which of her 
friends had made it out alive, and how friends witnessed bodies blown 
apart by grenades. Maya told me she is haunted by the images her 
friends shared of Hamas desecrating bodies and by how they seemed to 
enjoy it. She said she feels guilty for encouraging her friends to join 
her at the music festival that Saturday.
  This is why Israel fights.
  The attacks of October 7 confronted the world with the sort of 
horrors Jewish communities have no choice but to remember for 
generations. From European villages caught in pogroms to the horrors of 
Nazi Germany, to Israeli kibbutzim burned and bloodied by Hamas 
terrorists. For decades, the free world refrain has been: ``Never 
forget. Never again.''
  God help us if we do not mean what we say.
  There is no room for false moral equivalency. Let me repeat that: 
There is no room for false moral equivalency.
  We must not forget who is responsible, and we must hold them 
accountable. Terror and self-defense are not the same thing. One side 
started the war, but the other side will finish it. And the United 
States must give Israel the time, space, and support to bring innocent 
people home and bring murderous terrorists to justice.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. COTTON. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.;  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, early yesterday morning, I returned from a 
whirlwind trip to the Middle East as part of a bipartisan codel, or a 
congressional delegation, to Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The trip 
was a direct response to Hamas's savage attack on Israel. The codel, 
led by my friend Senator Lindsey Graham, brought together 10 Senators 
from both parties to show the United States' support for Israel and to 
demonstrate U.S. commitment to protecting our now-threatened national 
interests in the region.
  Our message was united: The United States stands with Israel. Iran is 
on notice, and it must stand down; and we need to get hostages freed 
and Americans out of harm's way.
  We are committed to seeing Hamas defeated so that a new chapter of 
prosperity for Israel and its Arab neighbors can begin, of which 
normalized relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia would be a 
keystone.
  Our engagements on the ground included frank and candid discussions 
with heads of state, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and our U.S. Embassy 
teams on the ground. Our day in Tel Aviv began with meeting the 
families of hostages being held in Gaza, including Americans who shared 
their painful stories. As a parent and grandparent, it is heartbreaking 
to see and hear the grief of these family members.
  Later that day, we met with Israeli defense officials for an update 
on the war. We were shown video evidence of the unnerving atrocities 
committed by Hamas terrorists--horrific images that I will not soon 
forget. Our meetings made clear the absolute imperative to see Hamas 
defeated.
  Hamas's attacks have been likened to Israel's own September 11; but 
Prime Minister Netanyahu made a point that is especially chilling for 
Americans but that every critic of Israel must hear. He pointed out 
that, on 9/11, our enemy was thousands of miles away. In Israel, their 
enemy is only a kilometer away.
  For more than 15 years, Israel has had to live every day with a 
terrorist organization on its border whose sole mission in life is to 
kill Jews and to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth; and during that 
time, Hamas has loomed as a persistent threat to Israel, attacking, 
kidnapping, and killing Israelis. But the barbarism and brutality that 
Hamas displayed in its October 7 attacks took its evil to new heights, 
and now Israel knows what it has to do: It has to wipe Hamas off the 
face of the Earth.
  For the Israelis, this is existential. Israel's cause is just, and 
its resolve is firm, and it should have every peace-loving nation in 
the world on its side. Now, how Israel goes about that mission matters, 
and it needs to be done in a way that minimizes civilian casualties.
  The Palestinians living in Gaza are also victims of Hamas's reign of 
terror. Hamas has made it clear that the only value it places on the 
lives of Palestinians is to use them as fodder to direct attention away 
from its atrocities and to try and turn public sentiment, especially in 
Western media and the Arab street, against Israel. Case in point: 
Hamas's disproven claim that Israel struck a hospital, which sparked 
protests and riots in a number of countries.
  Israelis know that there are innocent Palestinians trapped in this 
fight and that civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis could 
drive more Palestinians toward extremism. That is why Israel is taking 
measures to protect innocents in Gaza, although its efforts are being 
undermined by Hamas, which has discouraged Palestinians from complying 
with Israel's evacuation order.
  The United States and other peace-loving nations in the region and 
beyond need to give Israel space to take the fight to and eradicate 
Hamas, because if Hamas and its reign of terror are allowed to 
continue, no nation in the region or beyond will be able to live in 
peace and security. It really is that simple.
  And one final but important point: Hamas might claim to represent 
Palestinians, but its violent actions do nothing--nothing--to benefit 
the Palestinian people. The only people who benefit from this brutal 
bloodshed are the ayatollahs in Iran, whose goal is to bring chaos, 
violence, and death to all who don't share their extreme and militant 
religious ideology, which, I might add, includes wiping Israel off the 
face of the Earth.
  Look no further than Hamas if you want to see Iran's influence, as 90 
percent of their military budget comes from Iran, or Hezbollah, the 
terrorist organization on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, which 
is also armed and financed by Iran. Then there are the Houthis in Yemen 
who, in the aftermath of October 7, fired missiles and drones headed 
for Israel--again, likely at the direction of Iran; the Shia militias, 
who are attacking American soldiers in Iraq and Syria; the killing by 
Russians of innocent civilians in Ukraine with drones supplied by Iran. 
Through its proxies, Iran is literally getting away with murder.
  To the Iranian regime, we say: We are on to you.
  In addition to working with regional partners to get American 
hostages and citizens out of Gaza, the Biden administration must 
clearly articulate to the Iranians that, if they do not stand down or 
if they green-light the escalation of this war, the United States and 
our allies will be forced to respond forcefully. The movement of U.S. 
firepower to the region should make that point very clear to Tehran.
  The attacks on October 7 represent a kind of evil that the world 
hasn't seen in generations, and it must be confronted and contained. If 
it is not, we could see death and destruction on a scale akin to the 
horrors of the last century. History is watching.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hickenlooper). The clerk will call the 
roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order

Madam President, I wanted to take a few minutes to share 
my thoughts regarding the horrific situation in Israel and Gaza.
  On October 7, Hamas terrorists waged a barbarous attack against 
Israel, killing over 1,400 innocent men, women, and children. Young 
people at a music festival were machine-gunned down in cold blood, 
babies and older people were brutally murdered, and over 200 Israeli 
and Americans are being held as hostages.
  Some people describe the October 7 attack on Israel as equivalent to 
the 9/11 terrorist attack against the United States. That is wrong. 
Israel is a small country with under 10 million people. On a per capita 
basis, the 1,400 Israelis killed by Hamas would be the equivalent of 
over 40,000 Americans killed if Israel had the same size population as 
we do--40,000. On 9/11, as everybody recalls, we lost 3,000 people.
  Let us be clear. Israel suffered a major attack and has, as do all 
other countries under similar circumstances, the absolute right to 
defend itself. But having the right to defend your country against a 
terrorist attack and a terrorist organization like Hamas does not mean 
having the right to violate international law and wage indiscriminate 
warfare against innocent men, women, and children in Gaza.
  The people of Israel have gone through a horrific and traumatic 
shock. It is understandable that they are furious and want to strike 
back forcefully. Revenge, however, is not a useful policy. Killing 
innocent Palestinian women and children in Gaza will not bring back to 
life the innocent Israeli women and children who have been killed. It 
will only make a terrible situation even worse and more intractable.
  Let us be clear. The Palestinian people today are experiencing 
nothing less than a humanitarian disaster. Thousands are already dead, 
including many children--perhaps thousands of children--and far more 
have been wounded. Hundreds of thousands have been forced out of their 
homes. These people--deeply impoverished before this war began--now 
lack food, water, fuel, shelter, medicine, and other basic necessities.
  Unbelievably, more than 400,000 Palestinians driven from their homes 
are now sheltering in densely crowded, U.N.-run schools--400,000 people 
in U.N.-run schools. Dozens of medical facilities have been damaged and 
made inoperable, and 35 United Nations aid workers have been killed. 
The aid trickling into Gaza is just a fraction--a small amount--of what 
is needed. In a few days, hospitals will run out of fuel, and 
ventilators and incubators will shut off.
  This is a desperate, desperate humanitarian crisis.
  I echo Secretary Blinken's call for the immediate release of all 
hostages and for a humanitarian pause by all parties. A pause is 
essential for the protection of civilians, as required by the laws of 
war, as well as for the provision of robust supplies of food, water, 
and medical aid to address the growing humanitarian catastrophe. I know 
that Senator Merkley and others are working hard to gain support here 
in the Senate for that position, and I agree with it.
  Israel suffered a terrible attack, but the response must be carefully 
thought through and be carried out in line with international law.
  When the United States was attacked on 9/11, we allowed anger and 
rage to drive our response. This resulted in making grave mistakes in 
terms of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which cost us thousands of 
members of the U.S. military and, in fact, the lives of hundreds of 
thousands of innocent people in those countries.
  Israel has a right to defend itself and go after Hamas, but innocent 
Palestinians also have a right to life, security, and peace.
  Please remember that the last election held in Gaza was in 2006, when 
a majority of people in Gaza today were not yet born or could not vote. 
Even then, back in 2006, a minority voted for Hamas. Hamas is an 
authoritarian organization that does not necessarily represent a broad 
swath of the Palestinian people, and we must not conflate all 
Palestinians with this terrorist organization.
  Further and of much concern to me and, I think, many others, Israel 
is apparently contemplating an invasion and occupation of Gaza. I have 
very serious concerns about what this could mean in terms of the long-
term security of Israel, the well-being of the Palestinian residents of 
Gaza--half of whom are children--and the hope that peace, security, and 
justice will at some point come to that region.
  In Congress, we will soon be voting and debating a package which 
includes billions of dollars to Israel above and beyond the $3.8 
billion in military aid the United States sends there every year. The 
American people have a right to know if that money will be used to 
defend Israel or whether it will be used for an invasion and 
occupation.

  Israel's proposed invasion will likely bring difficult, street-by-
street fighting against entrenched Hamas fighters in a dense urban 
environment still populated by many civilians. Hamas will continue to 
use human shields and its extensive tunnel network and will likely 
resort to insurgent tactics.
  As two experts on the subject recently wrote, ``The battle will not 
end when Israel has reoccupied the territory. There is no Palestinian 
entity that Israel trusts to govern Gaza in Hamas's stead. As a result, 
a military victory could mean Israel has to administer the territory 
for the foreseeable future. Israeli officials, in other words, will 
have to govern an immiserated people who see them as their enemy and 
who may wage a guerrilla war.''
  I have serious concerns about what this invasion and potential 
occupation of Gaza will mean, both in terms of the long-term security 
of Israel and the well-being of the Palestinian residents of Gaza.
  In Congress, as we consider a package including billions of dollars 
for Israel that could fund this invasion and occupation, we clearly 
need much more information about Israel's long-term plans and goals, as 
well as the U.S. Government's assessment of those prospects.
  These are some--some--of the questions that need to be answered:
  How many innocent men, women, and children will be killed or wounded 
if Israel engages in an invasion and an occupation?
  How many Israeli soldiers will be killed or wounded in an operation 
of that kind?
  How will many hundreds of thousands of civilians receive the food, 
water, fuel, and medical care they need in the midst of what could be 
extremely heavy urban warfare in a very densely populated area?
  How long will it take to establish military control of Gaza, and what 
level of insurgent activity is anticipated from that point? In other 
words,

[[Page S5176]]

controlling Gaza is not the end of that process.
  How will the success of the operation be measured?
  Are there alternative approaches to a ground invasion that would be 
effective in ensuring Israel's long-term security?
  What will this operation mean for the hostages still being held in 
Gaza?
  What political force will administer Gaza after an Israeli operation?
  Will the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have been driven 
from their homes--they have been pushed out of their homes now, no 
place to go--will they be guaranteed safe return to their homes?
  Importantly, what impact will the invasion and occupation of Gaza 
have on the international community's support for Israel? How will the 
whole world feel about a powerful nation occupying a very impoverished 
part of the world?
  How will the international community address the ongoing needs in 
Gaza and the rest of Palestine when the shooting and bombs stop?
  What political process will follow this conflict, and what is the 
desired end-state in Gaza?
  These are some of the questions that have to be asked. As Congress 
considers the administration's emergency funding request, we need 
answers to these questions.
  This is, tragically, the fifth conflict between Israel and Hamas in 
15 years--fifth war in 15 years. Clearly, a terrorist organization like 
Hamas cannot be the answer to the very serious problems facing the 
people of Gaza.
  Just a few months ago, thousands of people defied Hamas's 
authoritarian rule to protest on the streets of Gaza. They stood up, 
with great courage, against Hamas's authoritarian rule. Their voices 
are silenced now, but there can be no long-term solution to this 
ongoing crisis without a serious effort to address Palestinian demands 
for peace, legitimate political representation, and a vibrant economy.
  I would just mention one fact, and that is, before this war, some 75 
percent of the young people were unemployed. So you have, aside from 
everything else, an economic disaster in Gaza.
  In my view, the United States must take a leading role in charting 
out a future that respects the lives of Palestinians and Israelis 
alike. We can start by answering the questions laid out above, and I 
very much look forward to receiving from the administration a briefing, 
in a classified setting, if necessary, in order for Members of Congress 
to understand what an occupation and invasion will look like.
  We are living in a horrifically difficult moment in the Middle East, 
and I can understand the outrage that many people in Israel feel in 
terms of the attack that killed 1,400 of their people, but now is the 
time, in Israel and in the United States, for us to not allow revenge 
and rage to dictate our policy but to really think this issue through.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma;  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, this amendment would create an 
automatic CR, which would make it way harder for Congress to actually 
get its job done and fund our government. It would allow Members, 
particularly those who are fine with obstructing, to ignore their 
responsibility to fund our government and deliver for the communities 
that they represent; it will hurt Agencies and programs people count on 
by freezing funding levels; it will weaken our ability to deliver 
funding for Ukraine and Israel, for childcare and so much else; it will 
allow critical laws to lapse and potentially create chaos on this 
floor.
  Let's be clear. No one wants to avoid a shutdown more than I do. But 
the way that we avoid a shutdown is by Members of Congress sitting down 
and working together to prevent one, responsibly, by funding our 
government, not by abdicating Congress's responsibility to control the 
powers of the purse and avoiding the hard work of compromise by putting 
funding on perpetual autopilot.
  But I am afraid that is exactly what this amendment would do, and it 
would create a new, unproven fast-track process, allowing six Senators 
to completely ignore our committee process, completely ignore regular 
order, and take over the floor and force the Senate to consider 
appropriations vehicles of any and all sizes with little or no scrutiny 
or input.
  We need to get our jobs done. We need to pass our appropriations 
bills. That is what we are working on, not set ourselves on a path to 
endlessly kick the can down the road. I strongly urge my colleagues to 
vote no on this amendment.
  I yield the floor."

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 771) standing with Israel as it defends itself 
against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists.
  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.
  The text of the resolution is as follows:

                              H. Res. 771

       Whereas on October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a 
     massive, unprovoked war on Israel by air, land, and sea, 
     including firing thousands of rockets;
       Whereas this heinous assault took place just after the 50th 
     anniversary of the start of the multi-front 1973 Yom Kippur 
     War against Israel;
       Whereas Hamas terrorists crossed the land border and began 
     slaughtering Israelis and abducting hostages in towns in 
     southern Israel, including children and the elderly;
       Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas launched over 4,500 
     rockets into southern and central Israel;
       Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists have killed 
     over 900 Israelis and injured more than 2,600 others;
       Whereas at least 11 United States citizens in Israel are 
     among those killed by Hamas since October 7, 2023;
       Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas is directly 
     responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians;
       Whereas the expansion of this war to other fronts by 
     Hezbollah, Iran, or others would create an even more 
     devastating regional catastrophe;
       Whereas Hamas is a United States-designated Foreign 
     Terrorist Organization;
       Whereas Iran has long provided support to Hamas and other 
     terrorist groups and proxies, and prior United States 
     Government unclassified assessments indicated that, ``Iran 
     has historically provided up to $100 million annually in 
     combined support to Palestinian terrorist groups, including 
     Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and the Popular Front 
     for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command'';
       Whereas Hamas used rudimentary, civilian equipment, such as 
     bulldozers, paragliders, and rubber boats in its assault on 
     Israel, demonstrating the importance of fully enforcing tight 
     controls on what materials go into the Gaza Strip, including 
     through thorough vetting of assistance;
       Whereas under the 2016 U.S.-Israel Memorandum of 
     Understanding, the United States pledged to provide Israel 
     $3.3 billion per year in Foreign Military Financing Program 
     assistance and $500 million per year in missile defense for 
     10 years, which Congress has appropriated annually;
       Whereas section 1273 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry 
     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 
     authorized not less than $3.3 billion in Foreign Military 
     Financing Program assistance for Israel for each of the 
     fiscal years 2021 through 2028, in accordance with the 2016 
     U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding;
       Whereas Congress has responded with additional 
     appropriations beyond the terms of the 2016 U.S.-Israel 
     Memorandum of Understanding as needed, including in March 
     2022 when Congress appropriated an additional $1 billion for 
     Iron Dome defense system after the May 2021 conflict in which 
     Hamas launched more than 4,400 rockets at Israel; and
       Whereas Israel is a major non-NATO ally and Major Strategic 
     Partner of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
       (1) stands with Israel as it defends itself against the 
     barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists;
       (2) reaffirms Israel's right to self-defense;
       (3) condemns Hamas' brutal war against Israel;

[[Page H5054]]

       (4) calls on all countries to unequivocally condemn Hamas' 
     brutal war against Israel;
       (5) calls on Hamas to immediately cease these violent 
     attacks and safely release all living hostages and return the 
     bodies of deceased hostages;
       (6) mourns the over 900 Israelis and 11 Americans killed 
     and over 2,600 others wounded in Hamas' unprovoked attack on 
     Israel;
       (7) reaffirms the United States' commitment to Israel's 
     security, including through security assistance in accordance 
     with the 2016 U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding;
       (8) urges full enforcement of the Taylor Force Act (title X 
     of division S of Public Law 115-141; 132 Stat. 1143) and 
     other restrictions in United States law to prevent United 
     States foreign assistance from benefiting terrorists, 
     directly or indirectly;
       (9) condemns Iran's support for terrorist groups and 
     proxies, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad;
       (10) urges full enforcement of United States sanctions 
     against Iran to prevent Iran's funding of terrorist groups, 
     including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad; and
       (11) stands ready to assist Israel with emergency resupply 
     and other security, diplomatic, and intelligence support.

  The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
McCaul) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) each will control 
20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to extend debate for 
each side by 10 minutes, and I also ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks 
and to include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from 
Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, October 7, Israelis awoke to rockets 
raining down on them from Gaza, and gunmen broke down their doors and 
invaded their homes.
  Hamas terrorists killed babies and toddlers. They killed elderly 
grandmothers and grandfathers. They killed moms and dads. They killed 
teenage kids in their homes. No one was spared from their brutality.
  Following World War II, my father's war, I never believed the world 
would bear witness to the slaughter of the Jewish people as we have 
seen at the bloody hands of Hamas. October 7 was the deadliest day for 
the Jewish people since the Holocaust.
  Additionally, Hamas is holding 220 hostages, including Americans. 
This is a flyer with a picture of a mother and son taken hostage by 
Hamas, #bringthemhomenow.
  They are using them as human shields and threatening to execute them. 
They must all be released unconditionally now.
  This is one of the darkest moments in the history of the State of 
Israel.
  I was in one of the kibbutzim right on the border of Gaza last year, 
meeting with members of the community. I saw their daycare center. That 
very same kibbutz was overrun by 70 Hamas terrorists. Many of the 
residents I met were slaughtered.
  Most viciously, the babies and the children I visited in the daycare 
center were slaughtered, shot to death, beheaded, and burned alive.
  When the press says it didn't happen, they are just wrong. It did 
because I have seen the pictures of the burned babies and the 
decapitated children and the blood that you see here in the babies' 
cribs.
  For God's sake, what is going on in this world today?
  In one of the most horrific stories to emerge, a pregnant woman had 
her baby cut out in front of her very eyes as they murdered her baby 
before her and before they shot her in the head.
  Simply put, Mr. Speaker, they are monsters.
  At a music festival to celebrate peace, chaos, gunfire, and 
explosions ripped through the air, piercing hundreds of bodies with 
bullets and shrapnel. While the attendees attempted to flee the area, 
gunmen surrounded them from every direction. In total, 260 attendees 
assembled in peace to enjoy music were massacred.
  Among others, atrocities we have heard reported include children with 
their hands bound, shot in the back of the head execution style; women 
who were raped and slaughtered, one of whom was dragged through the 
streets of Gaza; families, including babies and young children, burned 
alive in their homes in front of their parents; the beheading of 
Israeli soldiers; and parents gunned down as they shielded their 
children before the onslaught of gunfire.
  This is sheer terror. It is evil. It cannot stand in this world.
  We are witnessing in real time Hamas carrying out their covenant that 
outlines their goal of eradicating Israel through jihad. In fact, their 
covenant states: ``Israel will exist and will continue to exist until 
Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.''
  They specifically discuss jihad, noting: ``The day that enemies usurp 
part of Muslim land, jihad becomes the individual duty of every Muslim. 
In face of the Jews' usurpation . . . , it is compulsory that the 
banner of jihad be raised.''
  Mr. Speaker, it was indeed raised on October 7.
  To be completely clear, despite repeated efforts by Israel to secure 
peace, the ``Hamas Covenant'' states: Peace ``initiatives, and so-
called peaceful solutions and international conferences, are in 
contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement. . . 
. There is no solution for the Palestinian problem except by jihad.''
  This declaration calling on the annihilation of the Jewish state must 
be confronted with zero equivocation.
  That is why I worked with my good friend, Ranking Member Meeks, to 
introduce this bipartisan resolution.
  It condemns in the strongest possible terms the atrocities of Hamas 
and reiterates Israel's right to defend herself, along with America's 
unwavering support for the State of Israel.
  All roads lead back to Iran. Their fingerprints are all over this 
attack. They have consistently funded Hamas and other Palestinian 
groups to the tune of $100 million per year.
  This resolution condemns Hamas and Iran for its support of terrorist 
groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic jihad while also 
calling for all sanctions on Iran to be fully enforced.
  I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution. It will 
send a clear message across the world that terrorists and their 
sponsors will be held to account for their atrocities, their crimes 
against humanity, their crimes of genocide.
  On December 7, 1941, in response to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, 
President Roosevelt said it was ``a date which will live in infamy.'' 
So, too, will October 7, 2023, live in infamy.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this extraordinarily important 
resolution written with my friend and colleague, Chairman McCaul.

  Mr. Speaker, 18 days ago, the State of Israel suffered the greatest 
mass murder perpetrated against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, 
when Hamas terrorists invaded Israel by land, sea, and air.
  Behaving just like ISIS, Hamas terrorists murdered and beheaded 
soldiers and civilians alike. Babies were shot and burned in their 
cribs and reduced to smoldering piles of ash--babies.
  Children were murdered. Teenagers were murdered. Men and women were 
murdered. Elderly people, including Holocaust survivors, were murdered.
  Hamas has also taken 200 of those who survived into Gaza as hostages, 
including unaccompanied children, Holocaust survivors, and many 
American citizens.
  Mr. Speaker, Hamas' attack was truly unprecedented. When you consider 
the size of Israel's population, proportionately it would be like 
30,000 people dying in New York on 9/11. Just let that sink in a 
little.
  We must all acknowledge that Hamas is a cutthroat terrorist 
organization that exists solely to destroy Israel. Hamas' terrorism 
does not help the Palestinians. In this moment, it is critical for 
Israel to know that the United States of America stands firmly by its 
side in this battle against Hamas.
  Mr. Speaker, what I am about to say next is also very important. 
There are innocent Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank who seek 
normal and free lives and want nothing to do with Hamas or other 
terrorist organizations.

[[Page H5055]]

We cannot lose sight of this. We must keep them--many of whom are also 
children--and their safety and well-being in mind. In the immediate 
term, we must find a way to ensure the safety of those innocents who 
are in Gaza's war zone, and I support the Biden administration's 
efforts toward that goal.
  The United Nations estimates that thousands of Palestinians have been 
killed since the terrorist attacks on October 7. We don't know for 
certain how many of those killed were civilians, but here is what we do 
know: We know that Hamas terrorists used Palestinians as human shields. 
We know that every single one of them would be alive today if Hamas had 
not launched its terrorist attack.
  We must be aware and do all that we can to stop this war from 
expanding beyond its current scope. The administration and our allies 
are working around the clock to send messages and warnings to Iran and 
Hezbollah to stay out. President Biden underscored this message during 
his recent travel to Israel.
  Do not test America's will. This Congress will have Israel's back as 
it degrades and eliminates Hamas' terrorist infrastructure. We know 
that it won't take a day. It will be difficult.

                              {time}  1545

  For too long, too many have been willing to contribute to the 
delegitimization of the State of Israel.
  It is deeply concerning that even global leaders are already 
whitewashing one of the worst terrorist attacks in history while Hamas 
and its allies blanket cyberspace with misinformation about this war.
  Just yesterday, Turkish President Erdogan said: ``Hamas is not a 
terrorist organization, it is a group of mujahideen defending their 
lands.''
  This from the mouth of a NATO ally who has his own concerns about 
terrorists as an existential threat to his country.
  President Erdogan's rhetoric is dead wrong. It is rank with 
hypocrisy, and its timing is extraordinarily dangerous.
  The resolution before us is a bright spot of bipartisanship today 
during a very difficult time in American politics.
  Mr. Speaker, 425 Members of this House of Representatives have 
cosponsored this resolution. There is no question in my mind that it 
will pass overwhelmingly, Democrats and Republicans alike. Most 
importantly, the American people believe in the Jewish state and 
believe in its survival.
  In the days, weeks, and months ahead, I know the United States will 
continue to stand steadfastly with Israel to assure its defense and its 
long-term security.
  We will also, as President Biden has outlined, remain committed to 
ensuring that civilians in Gaza have access to safe areas and continue 
to have access to food, water, medical care, and other assistance 
without diversions by Hamas.
  We must also stay keenly focused on working to get United States 
citizens and their immediate family members to exit Gaza safely.
  I conclude, Mr. Speaker, by raising an issue that the United States 
and Israel must address: What does a successful ground operation in 
Gaza look like, and how do we achieve the goal of leaving Gaza to a 
responsible Palestinian Government if Israel's effort to remove Hamas 
is successful?
  One thing is for certain--the path to peace will require more Arab 
States to recognize that Israel has the right to exist and that we hold 
firm and will make sure that we could thereby have a two-State 
solution.
  If you say Israel does not have the right to exist, you are saying 
that you do not want peace. I urge our Arab friends to join the Abraham 
Accords and acknowledge Israel's right to exist because that is the 
pathway to peace in the Middle East.
  To the people of Israel, I hope you learn of the passage of this 
resolution today and know that the United States Congress and the 
American people have your back.
  We mourn beside you and are working to provide the resources your 
government needs to defend you. We have deployed powerful military 
resources to the region to demonstrate just that support.
  We are working all of our diplomatic channels to assure your success, 
and we are in this together. We will not waver. We will not quit. We 
will stand with our ally Israel.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on 
Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations.
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished 
chairman and the ranking member for this extraordinarily important 
resolution.
  Mr. Speaker, our great friend and ally Israel, with significant 
assistance from the United States, continues to respond to the cowardly 
Hamas invasion that includes Hamas' psychotic terrorist butchering of 
innocent civilians, rape, hostage-taking, the beheading of babies, and 
daily indiscriminate missile attacks that are reminiscent of Nazi buzz 
bombs and V-2 rockets.
  Israel Prime Minister Netanyahu has said in the past that he would 
never allow a second Holocaust, nor should we.
  Anti-Semitism is at the root of Hamas' violence against Israel and 
every Jewish man, woman, and child. Israel's right to defend itself 
from this brutal invasion is absolute.
  Hamas' 1988 charter explicitly demands the absolute destruction of 
the State of Israel and proclaims: ``Israel will exist and will 
continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it. . . . ''
  Article 7 of the Hamas charter demands the slaughter of all Jews and 
says:

       The Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks 
     and trees will cry out, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come 
     and kill him.

  Article 13 explicitly rejects initiatives for peace and 
reconciliation and states, ``Initiatives, and so-called peaceful 
solutions and international conferences, are in contradiction to the 
principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement.''
  In its 2017 charter, Hamas reiterated its goal of wiping Israel off 
the face of the Earth and said: ``There is no alternative to a fully 
sovereign Palestinian State on the entire national Palestinian soil, 
with Jerusalem as its capital.''
  Like the Nazis before them, Hamas and its chief terrorism sponsor, 
Iran, are committing genocide against the Jews.
  The United States--and all people committed to human rights and the 
rule of law--must stand with Israel. That means our support and prayers 
and the weapons systems to defeat Hamas.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Manning), a member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee.
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, 18 days ago, more than 1,000 Hamas 
terrorists invaded our Democratic ally Israel, and in the most 
gruesome, savage, and unimaginably barbaric manner attacked 22 Israeli 
towns, going house to house slaughtering families, raping 
girls, beheading babies, setting fire to homes where children were 
hiding in safe rooms, burning them alive, and taking more than 200 
people of 40 different nationalities hostage, including taking infants 
and the elderly hostage.

  They massacred more than 260 young people attending an outdoor peace 
concert. They perpetrated the worst attack on the Jewish people since 
the Holocaust, slaughtering more than 1,400 people, including 39 
Americans.
  In committing these horrific crimes against humanity, they have 
brought disaster to the very people they govern--the Palestinian 
people.
  They hide their fighters among civilians. They place rocket launchers 
and weapons in schools, in hospitals, in mosques, and in residential 
buildings, compounding their acts of evil.
  I was so proud that President Biden immediately expressed the full 
support of the United States for the State of Israel.
  He traveled to Israel in a time of war to embrace the Israeli people, 
to show with his presence that the Jewish state has not only a right 
but a duty to defend itself against Hamas, a terrorist group that has 
in its charter as its foundational purpose to murder Jews and destroy 
the State of Israel.
  Make no mistake: When they shout, ``from the river to the sea,'' they 
are calling for the total destruction of the

[[Page H5056]]

State of Israel and ridding the Middle East of all Jews.
  Well, let me say: not on our watch. The United States will stand side 
by side with our Democratic ally Israel. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in voting in support of this resolution.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the vice chair of the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs.
  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 771.
  Today, the House has an opportunity to demonstrate moral clarity and 
moral courage. These past few weeks have exposed a level of anti-
Semitism in this Nation that is frightening.
  Whether it is schoolchildren chanting for the genocide of Israelis by 
calling for removal ``from the river to the sea'' or radicalized 
college students projecting anti-Semitic slogans on the side of school 
property, it is clear young Americans are being indoctrinated against 
Israel. These actions must be condemned.
  Hamas is a terror organization that slaughtered innocent women and 
children. Hamas is a terror organization that manipulated Western media 
into doing their bidding by spreading lies about attacks Israel did not 
commit. Hamas is a terror organization that steals foreign aid, using 
it to construct rockets and attack Israel.
  These are not my opinions, Mr. Speaker, they are facts. Yet too many 
refuse to call Hamas out for what it is: evil incarnate, focused solely 
on the destruction of the Jewish people.
  Mr. Speaker, the United States Government must be united in support 
of Israel and against Hamas and anti-Semitism.
  There should be no equivocation from the White House when asked 
whether the rise of anti-Semitism is wrong. There should be no 
equivocation from a Member of Congress about whether to stand with 
Israel or with terrorist groups like Hamas.
  Today, this body is speaking loudly to the international community 
that Israel must have the resources to defend itself from genocidal 
terrorists.
  With one voice, let us support H. Res. 771 and stand with Israel. If, 
Mr. Speaker, you cannot bring yourself to support this resolution 
today, I would encourage any such Member to do the right thing and 
resign from this body.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the former majority leader of this distinguished 
body.
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  For millennia, the Jews of the world have been subject all over the 
world to prejudice, hate, and violence.
  Mr. Speaker, I have visited the Kfar Aza kibbutz over four times in 
the last 25 years. It was a place of community. On October 7, Hamas 
turned it into a place of slaughter.
  This brutal terrorist organization will pursue its genocidal, anti-
Semitic mission to fight and kill Jews. That is their purpose.
  The Jewish State of Israel will cease to exist if their objectives 
are achieved. Hamas will not yield, and neither can we.
  As the resolution makes clear, we will stand by our ally Israel; have 
their back, Mr. Chairman.
  Dozens of American civilians have been killed, wounded, and held 
captive in this war. We have also seen the scourge of anti-Semitism 
here in America.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Flood). The time of the gentleman has 
expired.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Maryland.
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we must follow this resolution with action. 
We must all vote for this resolution and speak with one voice; action 
that shows the world that America will defend its allies in Israel, in 
Ukraine, and around the world.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to support 
this bipartisan resolution, which has been offered by our chairman  
Mike McCaul and our ranking member  Greg Meeks.
  I was born with an appreciation for the people of Jewish faith. My 
birthplace of Charleston, South Carolina, at the time of the American 
Revolution had the largest Jewish population in the New World who had 
come here to escape oppression and to achieve freedom, which they 
achieved in America.

  I am grateful today to be the chairman of the Subcommittee on Middle 
East, North Africa, and Central Africa and co-chairman of the Israel 
Caucus.
  Just 7 weeks ago today, I met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
who is so courageous and is serving there in Jerusalem.
  I pledged then my support of Israel to defend itself from a nuclear 
Iran, which also includes, of course, support of Israel from the 
barbaric invasion of Hamas, the puppets of Iran who have conducted 
murder, killing hundreds of persons, 1,200 at least, and even possibly 
more that, indeed, are puppets of Iran to kill people in Israel.
  Sadly, we are in a conflict we did not choose with dictators with 
rule of gun invading democracies with rule of law.
  On October 7, which is the Israeli equivalent of 9/11 and Pearl 
Harbor, I was grateful to be attending the NATO Parliamentary Assembly 
in Copenhagen, Denmark, where with Finland and Sweden, Western 
civilization has never been more united to defend Ukraine, Israel, and 
Taiwan.
  America's resolve for Israel I saw firsthand on May 14, 2018, leading 
a House delegation to fulfill President Donald Trump's opening of the 
U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem with the extraordinary Ambassador David 
Friedman.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues of both parties to support the 
resolution.

                              {time}  1600

  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Sherman), a member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee.
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Hakeem Jeffries for his speech in 
favor of the importance of this resolution.
  The scenes from Gaza are horrendous and some cry out for a cease-
fire. Hamas cannot follow a cease-fire. They exist and it is in their 
charter to kill every Jew in the Middle East. If they agreed to a 
cease-fire, they would fall apart. They had a cease-fire on October 6, 
which is why they killed 1,400 civilians on October 7.
  We can get a cease-fire when Hamas agrees to disarm and release the 
hostages. The loud voices demanding a cease-fire should be shouting at 
Hamas demanding those two actions.
  We hear quotes from the Gaza Ministry of Health. The Gaza Ministry of 
Health counts in their death counts the terrorists who are killed and 
mixes them with the civilians. The Gaza Ministry of Health is under the 
control of Hamas.
  Hamas brutally murders Palestinians who dare to dissent. It forces 
innocent Palestinians to act as human shields, and it steals aid meant 
for civilians. Thirty percent of the time when it shoots a rocket in an 
effort to kill an Israeli civilian, the rocket never leaves Gaza and it 
falls down to Earth where it may kill Palestinians, including those who 
died at that hospital in Gaza.
  Israel is characterized as somehow a European colony. Keep in mind, 
the majority of Israeli Jews are there from Arab States and Iran from 
which they have been expelled or persecuted. This is a Middle Eastern 
country of Middle Eastern descent from people who, 2,000 years ago, 
lived there but also lived there right until the Arab States expelled 
them or persecuted them.
  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to a time when we can have a two-state 
solution, that begins with the destruction of Hamas.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. Kim), the chair of the Foreign Affairs 
Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific.
  Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
resolution to demonstrate that this House stands united with Israel as 
it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other 
terrorists.
  On October 7, we watched in horror as hundreds of terrorists poured 
across the Israel-Gaza border and massacred, kidnapped, and raped 
Israelis. It is abhorrent. This is at the hands of Hamas

[[Page H5057]]

and Hezbollah terrorist groups backed and funded by the Iran regime. 
They want to wipe Israel off the map. Thousands of rockets have fallen 
on Israel and continue falling as we speak. This has been the worst 
attack on Jews since the Holocaust.
  I visited Israel last year, and I felt the constant threat of attack 
that the people of Israel face. It reminded me of my time growing up in 
South Korea as a young girl after the Korean war, and I felt that 
constant threat coming from North Korea. This is really personal to me. 
Hamas now holds around 200 hostages from Israel, the U.S., and other 
countries around the world.
  Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist aggression, 
bring its hostages home, and its right to exist.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Meeks for 
leading this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Schneider), a strong member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee.
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking 
Member Meeks for leading on this resolution.
  Hamas is a terrorist organization that is backed by Iran, driven by 
hate, and committed to genocide. Since its founding, Hamas has been 
dedicated to the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews.
  All who cherish life, value democracy, and seek justice must 
resolutely condemn Hamas, condemn its heinous attack on October 7, and 
condemn its war with Israel.
  Israel has the right and the responsibility to defend itself against 
Hamas, to protect its citizens, to secure its borders, and to rescue 
its hostages no matter how long it takes.
  Peace will only come after Hamas releases the hostages, ceases 
launching rockets at Israeli neighborhoods from Palestinian 
neighborhoods, schools, and hospitals, and Hamas no longer governs Gaza 
or threatens Israel. Until then, Palestinians and Israelis cannot know 
peace.
  Three points: Hamas is a murderous organization and its aspirations 
are no different than al-Qaida or ISIS. Twenty-two years ago, the 
United States went to war halfway across the world. Today, Hamas is not 
halfway across the world, but is entrenched on Israel's border.
  Point number two: Israel must be able to defend itself and protect 
its citizens.
  Point number three: The United States, the United States Congress, 
and the American people stand with Israel. Our relationship is 
unbreakable. Our commitment to Israel's security to a Jewish democratic 
State is ironclad.
  Israel has no better friend than the United States and the United 
States has no better friend than Israel.
  To those who cheer Hamas, who turn a blind eye to murder, rape, 
torture, and kidnapping, you cast your lot with the barbarians and 
share in their shame.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Issa).
  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, many in this body continue to say that no 
words can describe the horror that the Israeli people are facing. That 
is not true. There are words to describe it and they have to be said. 
Some of those words are simply the facts, the real information that we 
are not seeing. One of them is that we are constantly hearing from pro-
Palestinian groups that in fact you have a right to resist occupation.
  I have been in this body since 2001. I was in Israel under Ariel 
Sharon when he withdrew every single settler and every soldier from 
Gaza. Gaza has not been under occupation, just the opposite. When they 
didn't like the control they had after an election, Hamas seized, by 
violence, the control of Gaza, killing their fellow Palestinians. Since 
that time, they have been a war-making machine that has in fact been 
financed by Iran, equipped by Iran, and today it is Iran that owes an 
apology to the world, and the Palestinian people need to discount 
forever their association.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Costa), another strong member of the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee.
  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Meeks), and the chair for putting together this very strong resolution, 
H.R. 771.
  The United States unequivocally stands with the State of Israel and 
its people.
  The world is watching our actions today and tomorrow and by our 
actions will determine the future of democracies around the world; 
therefore, we must be unified and bipartisan.
  Terrorism is never ever justified. Israel has the right to exist and 
defend itself against Hamas. Hamas is a terrorist group whose only 
purpose is to destroy the State of Israel and its people.
  Therefore, Congress and the President must together pass a strong 
bipartisan package to support our ally Israel. We must send a strong 
message to Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah not to escalate the situation. In 
the President's word: ``Don't.'' Don't think about it.
  America defends its allies, Israel, Ukraine, and other freedom-loving 
democracies around the world. We stand by our word.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority leader.
  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member 
Meeks for coming together on this critical, important piece of 
legislation, the first piece of legislation under Speaker   Mike 
Johnson, to stand with our friend Israel as they are under attack from 
Hamas and other terrorist organizations.
  Let's not forget what has happened because there are reports that 
Iran and other terrorist organizations worked with Hamas for not only 
months, but possibly over a year, planning these vicious attacks that 
now result in war and death of so many people--not just Israelis, 
Americans, hostages, so many injured, and thousands more.
  This is horrific. This is an opportunity for people all around the 
world to stand with Israel's right to defend themselves. As we look at 
the casualties, the devastation, and the barbaric nature of the attacks 
coming from Hamas and Gaza, we must recognize that the funding that 
goes to these terrorist organizations can be stopped with stronger 
action from this Congress.
  I know we are going to be coming together again to address some of 
those issues. We need to stand up against Iran's ability to sell oil on 
the world markets because they use those billions of dollars in funds 
to also augment and fund terrorism to groups like Hamas. Everybody 
knows it happens, it has been going on for years and years and it must 
stop. We must stand up against it.
  We must also freeze the $6 billion that still hasn't been transferred 
but that was negotiated as part of a settlement that even Iran has 
admitted can be used for whatever purpose they want, including funding 
terrorism. We can't stand by and let that happen either.
  As we are taking strong action to stand with Israel, our friend in 
the Middle East, we must also stand up to the anti-Semitism that we see 
here in our country that pops its ugly head during ugly times like 
this.
  Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues. There are 425 co-sponsors on 
this piece of legislation that shows that even in a divided Congress we 
can come together when it is time to support our strongest ally in the 
region when they are under attack. We strongly stand with Israel.
  Mr. Speaker, let's pass this legislation overwhelmingly.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the former chair of the 
House Appropriations Committee and the current Ranking Member of the 
House Appropriations Committee.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I am devastated by Hamas' brutal attacks on 
innocent civilians in Israel, which include taking children, women, and 
elderly people hostage. I strongly stand by our ally Israel and 
unequivocally support its right to defend itself.
  This vicious assault was enabled by Iran, which has publicly praised 
the attacks. Now more than ever, it is vital

[[Page H5058]]

that the United States does not walk away from its global commitment to 
defend democracy.
  This war is against Hamas; it is not the Palestinian people. 
Palestinians have also lost communities and loved ones because of 
Hamas' atrocities. Israel has to end Hamas' role in Gaza, while we work 
together to minimize harm to civilian populations. Hamas' presence is 
an assault on humanity, and I want to work with the unity governmental 
in Israel to create the conditions for peace again.
  As ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am intent 
on ensuring that we do everything that we can to provide the 
humanitarian and military assistance that is necessary for Israel to 
recover from this devastation and continue to defend itself.

                              {time}  1615

  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, let's be honest. If Hamas puts down its 
guns, peace will happen. If Israel does that, they will be slaughtered.
  In these brutal attacks by Hamas terrorists, they have killed over 
1,400 Israelis and taken over 200 hostages, including American 
citizens. I thought it was very telling when I saw a Jewish father on 
the news celebrating the fact that his daughter had died in the initial 
attack because he was afraid that she had been abducted and all these 
horrible, horrible things these dirtbags would have done to her.
  We have had a few weeks of discontent here in this body, but today, I 
think we all stand united with Israel as a body. Israel and the Jewish 
people have long been targets. Hamas must understand their time is 
over, and they are about to meet their fate and their maker.
  We stand in solidarity with the people of Israel in their fight 
against these worthless thugs--Hamas, Hezbollah, and any other Iranian-
backed terrorist group. Our enemies must know that we are committed to 
our allies and that our enemies will die.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), the former chairman of the Agriculture 
Committee, the current ranking member.
  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the very first thing I want 
to say is this: Take note, those of you who are around the world 
watching this House of Representatives in action, that the very first 
bill that we are putting out is a bill to send a powerful message that 
we not only stand with Israel, but we will fight with Israel.
  There is absolutely no way, as God is our maker, that we are going to 
stand by and see Israel destroyed. Make no mistake about it. It is as 
clear as a bell. In the Holy Scriptures brought down by the mighty hand 
of God Almighty: Stand with my people, the people of Israel.
  Mr. Speaker, I was called upon as a member of the NATO Parliamentary 
Assembly to go to Iran to write the paper on Iran. I met the people of 
Iran, and I want the people of Iran to listen: Go to your mullahs. Go 
to your leadership. They are the ones that control Hamas, Hezbollah.
  Then, I call upon our friends in Saudi Arabia. The answer to this is 
in your hands.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Jackson), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. JACKSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, there has never been a more 
important moment in the relationship between the United States and 
Israel. I call upon this body to take all necessary actions to 
unequivocally stand with Israel as it fights for its very existence in 
this unprovoked war launched by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists.
  I have and always will do everything in my power to stand with 
Israel. I, like the rest of the civilized world, have been disgusted 
with the unspeakable and barbaric atrocities imposed on innocent 
Israeli women and children by these animals that call themselves Hamas.
  We must enact policies to provide Israel with anything and everything 
it needs to defend itself, to immediately end all illegal aid payments 
to the Palestinian terrorists, and to hold Iran accountable. As long as 
I have a vote in Congress, I will always cast my vote in support of the 
Jewish state.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the 
great State of California (Ms. Pelosi), the Honorable Speaker Emerita.
  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution 
to support one of our closest allies in the world and partners, Israel, 
as she defends herself against terrorist attacks.
  I thank Chairman McCaul for his leadership in bringing this to the 
floor. I also thank Chairman McCaul as well as Ranking Member Meeks for 
their leadership and working together, crafting this resounding 
statement of support, and doing so in a unifying, bipartisan way.
  Mr. Speaker, on October 7, we watched in horror as Hamas terrorists 
unleashed a brutal assault on Israel's families and slaughtered so 
many. We have gone into some detail about the brutality of it all. It 
is brutality outside the circle of civilized human behavior. The 
attacks were horrible.
  With this resolution, the United States Congress resoundingly 
declares our support for Israel, not with revenge but with justice, 
that justice will be done.
  While doing so, we continue to remain concerned about the 
humanitarian situation in Gaza, with civilians caught in the middle of 
the war. I echo Secretary Blinken's call for a humanitarian pause so 
that innocent lives can be saved.
  Mr. Speaker, 80 years ago, on the floor of this House, my father, 
Thomas D'Alesandro, as a Member of Congress from Maryland, called upon 
the Roosevelt administration to support the establishment of the State 
of Israel in what was known as Palestine at the time. He was early in 
calling for that, so it is in my DNA to protect that State of Israel.
  Hamas is dedicated to the destruction of the State of Israel. Hamas 
has been declared a terrorist organization by the United States. Hamas 
must be destroyed, but in destroying them, we must protect the children 
in Gaza. They use them as shields. We want to protect them.
  This resolution, with overwhelming bipartisan support on the floor of 
the House, is so necessary. I urge a unanimous vote and thank the 
chairman and ranking member for their leadership.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. Barr), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important resolution 
affirming Israel's right to self-defense against this savage war 
perpetrated by Hamas and other Iranian-backed terrorists.
  While it was Hamas terrorists who invaded peaceful communities across 
Israel, decapitating babies, burning elderly women alive, kidnapping 
innocent civilians, including Holocaust survivors, it was Iran that was 
working behind the scenes to fund these acts of terror.
  I support this resolution because it calls out the mullahs in Tehran 
for funding Hamas and enabling this attack to occur.
  How did this happen? In short, it happened because the Biden 
administration's foreign policy allowed it to happen. Our government 
designated Iran as a state sponsor of terror, yet the Biden 
administration pursued a policy of weakness and appeasement toward 
Tehran.
  Since the Biden administration took office, Iran has generated 
approximately $80 billion in revenue from oil sales, and that is 
because this administration rolled back the Trump administration's 
successful maximum pressure campaign.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Kentucky.
  Mr. BARR. In 2021, the administration lifted oil sanctions on Iran. 
The sanctions relief was so helpful to the regime that the deputy chief 
of the Central Bank of Iran said that Iran's foreign currency reserves 
were growing due to the growth of oil and other exports.
  For months, Secretary Blinken, National Security Advisor Sullivan, 
and other officials have chased another JCPOA to release billions of 
dollars in sanction assets. Now we see the administration effectively 
incentivize Hamas

[[Page H5059]]

to take American hostages by facilitating the transfer of $6 billion 
from South Korea to Iranian banks in Qatar, a deal that this 
administration claims it has frozen for now but Qatar and Iran say is 
available to them today. Support this resolution.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 7 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 10 minutes remaining.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
resolution and the State of Israel and to speak out against the 
horrific murder of 1,400 Israeli civilians and the kidnapping of 
hundreds more.
  The unspeakable, genocidal violence inflicted on Israelis and the 
Jewish people by Hamas terrorists goes beyond condemnation. It demands 
action.
  As part of a bipartisan and bicameral delegation, I was in the region 
in pursuit of peace when Hamas launched their cowardly attack on 
civilian communities. Three days later, I met with Israeli's unified 
leadership and pledged continued U.S. support for the defense of the 
Jewish state.
  President Biden has led our Nation in mourning the dead, praying for 
the kidnapped, and mobilizing to support Israel in eradicating Iranian-
backed death cults like Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic jihad, which are 
dedicated to the elimination of the Jewish people.
  Israel has never had a stronger ally and the Jewish community has 
never had a stronger advocate or stronger voice in the Oval Office.
  The unconscionable apathy of many nations and many in our own Nation 
is a sobering reminder of the fact that Israel remains surrounded by 
hostility and danger.
  As a proud Jewish American and Zionist, let me be clear: Israel has a 
right to defend itself, and Hamas must be destroyed.
  As an advocate for peace, normalization, and a two-state solution, it 
must be stated that Hamas is the primary obstacle to all three.
  We should not tolerate Americans who rationalize massacres and 
lionize monsters while spouting off anti-Semitic tropes and 
accusations.
  I will not equivocate because there is no equivalence between 
Israel's righteous efforts to protect its civilians and democracy from 
terror and Hamas using innocent Palestinians as a human shield, 
broadcasting carnage, burning families alive, and raping teenage girls 
to death. ``Am Yisrael chai''; ``the people of Israel live.''
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member 
for their work on this bipartisan, strong resolution.
  Iran and Russia are locked in a poisonous partnership committed to 
terror--terror in Ukraine, terror in Syria. Iran, as the world's 
largest state sponsor of terrorism, is further committed to the 
destruction of our ally Israel. On October 7, Iran's puppet, Hamas, 
commenced its most recent sick, savage slaughter of innocents.

  America was the first nation to recognize Israel in 1948. Over the 
decades, we have stood at her side when she has been attacked by force 
over her borders. We have stood by her side at anti-Semitic rhetoric in 
the halls of the United Nations. Together, we have been at the peace 
table seeking solutions.
  Today, united we stand on this House floor in prayer for the safe 
return of all the hostages taken by Hamas. I urge adoption on a strong 
bipartisan basis of this resolution in support of our ally Israel.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. Thanedar).
  Mr. THANEDAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 771.
  I firmly stand with Israel in the face of terrorism from Hamas.
  When I visited Israel in August, I saw how they were surrounded by 
threats. Now, those threats have come true in the most violent and 
terrible possible way.
  Let me be clear, our goal is the eradication of terrorists and 
terrorism from the face of this Earth.
  We call on and expect the Israeli army to try to minimize civilian 
casualties. We should make every reasonable effort to protect innocent 
Palestinians, but there can be no cease-fire until Hamas releases all 
hostages, stops its rocket attacks, and surrenders the leaders of the 
terrorist attack.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Kean), the chair of the Subcommittee on Europe.
  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the chairman 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for yielding me time.
  On the morning of Saturday, October 7, Hamas launched the most brutal 
and expansive surprise attack on Israel since the Yom Kippur War 50 
years ago.

                              {time}  1630

  The world stood in shock as reports and images began to surface of 
civilians murdered, young children beheaded, and Holocaust survivors 
being dragged into Gaza as hostages. Like many of my colleagues in this 
Chamber, I spent the past weeks engaging with the Jewish community 
leaders in my district, reassuring them of their communities' safety 
and speaking with constituents who had to flee back to the United 
States.
  I stand here in support of this overwhelming bipartisan resolution, 
which has almost every single Member of the House of Representatives as 
a cosponsor.
  As the House of Representatives, we support Israel's right to self-
defense and survival. We stand against Hamas, against its terror, and 
against its masters in Tehran. We stand with Israel in its fight for 
survival and against anti-Semitism in all of its forms.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).
  Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, my grandfather, Abe, fled 
the Holocaust as 6 million Jews were shot and tortured and gassed and 
starved. We often say, ``never again.'' Yet on October 7 it happened 
again, and make no mistake: The brutal, barbaric attacks by Hamas was 
not about freeing innocent people; it was about destroying Israel and 
killing Jews.
  Today, I am proud to stand with all those who condemn Hamas, support 
Israel's right to defend itself, and reaffirm the United States' 
commitment to Israel's security.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Lawler), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, women, children, babies slaughtered. The 
worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. Israel has a right to 
exist, a right to defend itself. We have Members in this body that do 
not believe that. We have Members in this body that cannot muster the 
courage or the strength to condemn the slaughtering of babies but have 
the audacity to repeat a vile and disgusting lie that Israel bombed a 
hospital.
  They are not worthy of serving in this body, and the fact that we 
have people that didn't even sign on to this resolution tells you 
everything you need to know. If you cannot stand with Israel, our 
greatest ally in the Middle East, a beacon of democracy and hope and 
freedom, you do not belong in this body. Those Members should resign in 
disgrace.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 4 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 7 minutes remaining.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).
  Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of this 
critical resolution to condemn Hamas' brutal attack on Israel and 
reiterate our Nation's support, our strong support, for our greatest 
ally in the Middle East--Israel.
  We all know that Hamas' heinous and unprovoked attack on innocent 
Israelis is barbaric. It is our responsibility as Members of Congress 
to stand united with Israel.
  Let me be clear: Israel has a fundamental right to defend herself and 
her people during this war.
  I am honored to be chairman of the bipartisan House-Knesset 
Parliamentary Friendship Group. From both

[[Page H5060]]

sides of the aisle, our members' support for the only democracy in the 
Middle East is absolutely ironclad.
  This resolution demonstrates our unwavering commitment to Israel and 
our relationship. It is important for our Nation and the rest of the 
world to hear this strong support and commitment from the United 
States' House of Representatives.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Meeks for 
their leadership.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Davis).
  Mr. DAVIS of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of this resolution, which expresses unwavering support for 
Israel.
  This past August, I traveled to Israel. I find it absolutely heart-
wrenching as I think of the very place that I visited just days later 
was attacked by Hamas at the Kfar Aza kibbutz where 58 people in the 
community were massacred and 17 kidnapped. It is just awful to think of 
babies being killed, people being slaughtered and gunned down in cold 
blood. At least 33 Americans have lost their lives. Others are missing.
  Let's be clear: A nation must respond, and, yes, we must respond. Let 
us continue to extend our unwavering support to Israel and ensure that 
the people of Israel have everything necessary to defend themselves and 
dismantle these egregious Hamas fighters.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Moran), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, as a Christian, freedom-loving Texan and 
sitting member of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, the events 
in Israel these past weeks are of utmost concern, but beyond that, they 
should concern every American and, frankly, every member of humanity 
regardless of religion, ethnicity, race, gender, or political 
affiliation.
  What we have seen in these past weeks is pure hate and pure evil. 
Hamas is a well-known, Iranian-backed terrorist organization whose 
official charter calls for the obliteration of Israel and the Jewish 
people.
  Let's consider that for a moment. These last few weeks have been 
proof of their commitment to this goal.
  How should we respond in the United States? The U.S. should act 
strategically with strength and steadiness so that those enemies of the 
U.S. and Israel are overwhelmed and ultimately defeated in their 
entirety. We must stand firmly with Israel with whatever they need.
  Now is not the time for timidity. It is the time for strength and 
unity with Israel. Such action will help deter evil in the future, 
preserve life, and promote liberty.

  Now is the time for us to be all in. We need to offer strength and 
steadiness in this time. Let us begin by standing with Israel.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Rose).
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of America's greatest 
ally in the Middle East--Israel, its people, and its right to defend 
itself against the horrifying Hamas terrorist attacks that have taken 
the lives of so many innocent individuals, including 33 Americans.
  Since that deadly attack, I have been working to assist Tennesseans 
and their families and friends in Israel in their attempts to come 
home. I have also joined members of the Tennessee delegation in a 
letter to President Biden urging him to support Israel by any means 
possible, including by providing any weapons and munitions necessary 
and punishing all involved in aiding the Hamas terrorists.
  Lastly, I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution we 
are here voting on today, which reaffirms our commitment to Israel and 
condemns Hamas' brutal terrorist attacks.
  Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to protect and defend our 
friend Israel.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Pfluger).
  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, it is great to be back at work, doing the 
important work of the House.
  Mr. Speaker, the United States stands united in the face of the 
horrific, barbaric attacks on our greatest ally in the Middle East--
Israel.
  The October 7 attack, nearly 50 years to the day after the Yom Kippur 
War, was horrific. More than 1,500-plus people murdered, hundreds more 
taken hostage, including American citizens. The brutality is unlike 
anything we have seen in modern times. With women and children being 
raped and babies beheaded, this cannot be the norm.
  Israel has every right to protect themselves, to defend themselves 
and their sovereignty. Our country must support Israel's efforts to 
protect its citizens and uphold its sovereignty without question.
  With misinformation and the horrible pro-Hamas demonstrations across 
the world, the U.S. Congress must reaffirm our unwavering support for 
Israel. Together, we must work toward a lasting peace that ensures the 
security and prosperity of our Jewish friends and Israel.
  Let us stand shoulder to shoulder in this pursuit, unwavering in our 
commitment to justice, freedom, and the enduring bonds that bind our 
nations together. We stand with Israel today and forever.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Idaho 
(Mr. Fulcher).
  Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Israel and H. Res. 
771.
  Israel is our most important partner in fighting terrorism. In fact, 
they are the first line of defense for the U.S. when it comes to 
terrorism because the sources of that terrorism are the same for both 
of us.
  Israel is a fabulous intelligence partner. I liken them to a giant 
antenna in the Middle East that serves and provides information to 
America.
  As the only true democracy in the Middle East, Israel is a beacon for 
the American ideals of freedom, personal liberty, and market economy.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand together and support 
Israel and H. Res. 771.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, let me start off by thanking my friend and 
colleague, the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. 
McCaul, for his friendship and for working collectively together to 
make sure that the world knows that there is no daylight between us 
when it comes to us standing with our friend and our ally the State of 
Israel, and I appreciate you.
  When we first started this, after this horrendous attack on October 
7, we had a conversation. We said, let's make sure that we put out a 
statement collectively, us giving our opinions as chair and ranking 
member of this committee. Then immediately thereafter, we went to work 
on a resolution so that the world would know where the United States' 
House of Representatives stood.
  We thought we would get it done earlier, but we knew that the first 
bill, the first resolution that would come to the floor after the House 
resumed its business, would be this bill because this bill is so 
significantly important to state that we have the back of our friend 
and ally, and we want to make sure that Hamas does not exist.
  Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege and the opportunity to visit 
Israel several times. I have been in some of those tunnels. I have 
talked to the people, and when I have talked to the people of Israel, 
all they say is that they want to live in peace. When I talk to the 
Palestinian people in Gaza or in the West Bank, they say they want 
peace, but the Hamas terrorist organization when you look at their 
mandate, they say they want the destruction of Israel.
  You cannot have peace. You can't even negotiate peace if one side 
says you should not exist. How can you say that you want a better 
relationship if you are saying that Israel should not exist?

                              {time}  1645

  You can't forget the horrific terrorist ISIS-like atrocities that 
were committed on October 7. You cannot be silent. You can't sit back 
and make believe that it didn't happen because it did.
  Mr. Speaker, I say, as we end this debate, thank you to the American 
people for standing with our friend and ally, the State of Israel.

[[Page H5061]]

  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Meeks, as well.
  Mr. Speaker, that is how the Foreign Affairs Committee operates. The 
fact that this is the most bipartisan resolution in modern history with 
425 cosponsors, over 97 percent of this body, speaks volumes. It sends 
a strong message to the people of Israel that the United States 
Congress and the American people stand firmly behind you.
  The Hamas Covenant states, ``Ranks will close, fighters joining other 
fighters, and masses everywhere in the Islamic world will come forward 
in response to the call of duty, loudly proclaiming: `Hail to Jihad.' 
This cry will reach the heavens and will go on being resounded until 
liberation is achieved, the invaders vanquished, and Allah's victory 
comes about.''
  In response to this, we will strengthen our resolve to stand with our 
ally Israel. This resolution sends a clear and unequivocal message that 
the United States House of Representatives and the American people 
condemn the barbarity of the genocide and war crimes perpetrated by 
Hamas. We want to make it clear that Israel has the right to defend 
herself to prevent an event like this from ever happening again.
  We assure you that the United States will be shoulder to shoulder 
with Israel supporting her right to self-defense.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution, 
and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear: I have condemned 
Hamas for their heinous attacks on civilians and call for an immediate 
release of the Israeli hostages. I continue to call for the safety of 
all civilians in the Middle East.
  Unfortunately, today's resolution H. Res. 771 is horribly one-sided. 
By failing to acknowledge the growing loss of Palestinian lives or that 
all Palestinians are not Hamas, this resolution creates further 
division and spurs harmful rhetoric.
  We must defend our Jewish brothers and sisters from Antisemitism. 
Muslims must also be defended from Islamophobia, and not have their 
patriotism questioned because they believe in justice for Palestinians.
  As a senior Member of the Intelligence Committee and through my work 
on the Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation 
Subcommittee--and having spent many years working in law enforcement--I 
am concerned that these kinds of one-sided resolutions have become and 
will continue to be recruitment tools for extremists.
  This is why I am co-leading H. Res. 786, the Ceasefire Now 
Resolution, which I believe is the best way to prevent further tragic 
loss of life to Palestinian civilians and simultaneously ensure the 
safe return of hostages. Only then can we begin to move towards a long-
term, two-state solution that includes both Palestinians and Israelis 
living in peace and liberation, side by side.
  This resolution rightly mourns the nearly 1,400 Israelis and 
Americans killed and wounded. But it completely ignores the mounting 
deaths of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza since October 7th, 
which has reached an estimated 5,761--including over 2,360 children 
killed and over 870 children missing under the rubble of destroyed 
buildings. Provided below, for the Record, are updated assessments 
about the destruction and deaths that civilians have suffered.
  Pain and grief know no boundaries. The United States fails in our 
duties as an international leader if we do not wholeheartedly condemn 
all violations of international law, whether it is committed by Hamas 
or the Israeli government.
  The United States urgently needs a new approach to this decades-long 
conflict. The roots of these problems existed long before October 7th. 
The Israeli government's 16-year blockade on Gaza has been identified 
by major human rights organizations as collective punishment and a war 
crime--and it has resulted in poor health, social, educational, 
physical, and political infrastructure throughout Palestine.
  Although I will vote ``no'' on this resolution, I urge every 
colleague who will vote today for H. Res. 771, to join me in bringing 
H. Res. 786 to the floor for a Ceasefire Now.

 UNRWA Situation Report #14 on the situation in the Gaza Strip and the 
                  West Bank (including East Jerusalem)

All information valid as of 24 October 2023 at 18:00 (local time)--Day 
                           17 of hostilities

                             1. Key Points

       More than 613,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) are 
     sheltering in 150 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza strip.
       In the last 24 hours, another three UNRWA staff members 
     have been killed, bringing the total to 38 staff killed since 
     7 October. Two have been injured, one of whom is in a 
     critical condition.
       One school in Rafah, sheltering 4,600 IDPs, sustained 
     severe collateral damage due to a close proximity strike. One 
     IDP was killed and 44 more were injured, including nine 
     children.
       Fuel is urgently needed to continue the UNRWA lifesaving 
     humanitarian operations. If fuel is not received into Gaza, 
     UNRWA will be forced to significantly reduce and in some 
     cases bring its humanitarian operations across the Gaza Strip 
     to a halt. The coming 24 hours are very critical.

                          2. Overall Situation


                             The Gaza Strip

       According to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, 5,791 people 
     have been killed since 7 October, including 2,360 children, 
     1,292 women, 295 elderly, and 16,298 were injured. This is in 
     addition to the 1,550 reported missing, presumably under the 
     rubble of destroyed buildings, including 870 children.
       Overall, nearly 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals have 
     been killed in Israel, according to the Israel authorities, 
     the vast majority on 7 October (OCHA).
       In the West Bank, 95 people have been killed and nearly 
     1,900 injured since 7 October.
       Overcrowding conditions in UNRWA shelters remain a serious 
     concern, as the current facilities can no longer provide 
     dignified living conditions. Some shelters are currently 
     hosting 10 to 12 times more people than their designed 
     capacity.

            3. Humanitarian Access & Protection of Civilians


                             THE GAZA STRIP

       Since 7 October, 38 UNRWA colleagues were killed and 20 
     have been injured, with one in critical condition.
       At least 42 UNRWA installations have been impacted since 7 
     October.

                           4. UNRWA Response


                             THE GAZA STRIP

       UNRWA Shelters:
       The average number of IDPs per shelter has reached 2.7 
     times capacity, with some shelters reaching 12 times intended 
     occupancy. In the Middle Area, one school is hosting up to 
     13,300 IDPs, while another facility in Khan Younis is hosting 
     21,000 persons.
       UNRWA continues to distribute assistance in shelters; 
     however current conditions severely constrain access to 
     essential services and represent a health and protection risk 
     for IDPs.
       Health:
       The eight UNRWA health centres that remain operational in 
     the South (out of 22) recorded 4,200 visits on 24 October for 
     refugees and non-refugees. In addition to essential primary 
     healthcare, post-natal and high-risk pregnancy care services 
     resumed on 24 October with 40 displaced women receiving this 
     service. Healthcare support for non-communicable diseases 
     (NCDs) patients continued.
       Healthcare services were maintained within the UNRWA 
     shelters, with the support of 93 mobile medical units and 
     medical teams, serving around 10,000 cases at shelters.
       According to initial health assessments from the mobile 
     medical teams there are over 37,500 persons with NCDs, over 
     4,660 pregnant women and around 390 post-natal cases 
     requiring medical attention among the IDPs. In addition, 
     medical teams are increasingly identifying cases of acute 
     respiratory and diarrhea among children under five years old.
       UNRWA's stocks of medicines are critically decreasing with 
     availability for a few more days only.
       UNRWA primary health centres are running out of fuel, 
     threatening the provision of essential healthcare services.
       Psychosocial Support:
       UNRWA has counsellors and social workers in the shelters, 
     who provide psychological first aid and other specialized 
     protection services. Since the beginning of the crisis, UNRWA 
     social workers provided 8,900 people with psychosocial 
     support and social work services. These include cases that 
     are referred for medication and other specialized mental 
     health and psychosocial support interventions.
       Protection/Crisis Intervention Unit (CIU):
       UNRWA conducted a Rapid Gender Analysis (RGA) to identify 
     the different impacts of the war on women, man, girls and 
     boys and better understand their different needs and coping 
     strategies. The RGA highlighted the following:
       There is a shortage of feminine hygiene supplies and very 
     few toilets. This results in increased challenges for females 
     to maintain menstrual hygiene.
       Overcrowding and limited privacy increase familial tensions 
     (which can increase the risk of GBV) and broader tensions 
     between males.
       There are critical gaps in access to health services that 
     particularly affect women and adolescent girls, including 
     access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care, newborn 
     care and sexual and reproductive health services.
       Water and Sanitation Services (WASH):
       Some solid waste collection from the camps and from 
     emergency shelters and transfer to landfills continues in 
     Middle, Khan Younis and Rafah areas with difficulties due to 
     the scarcity of fuel and staff.
       Water wells in Jabalia, Khan Younis and Rafah are 
     functional with about 11,000 m\3\ being pumped from nine 
     water wells.

[[Page H5062]]

       Despite the limited availability of fuel, desalination 
     plants continue to operate in the shelters for the provision 
     of potable water. Water trucking operations in shelters in 
     Rafah and Khan Younis also continue; however, the potable 
     water provided is not enough to meet all needs.
       Maintenance and rehabilitation work at shelters continue on 
     a daily basis. This includes essential repairs and upgrading 
     of shelters to accommodate additional IDPs when possible, as 
     well as the installation of mobile showers and toilet units.
       This resolution, while mourning the devastating loss of 
     Israeli civilian life, fails to even acknowledge the killing 
     and targeting of Palestinian civilians by the Israeli 
     military. It uses incendiary language that encourages the 
     suffocating military siege of the Gaza Strip and that 
     escalates violence and war.
       Furthermore, by stating Congressional support for possible 
     shipment of further US weapons to the Israeli military, this 
     resolution will significantly worsen and exacerbate violence 
     against Palestinian and Israeli civilians alike.
       Since this resolution was introduced, the Israeli 
     government and military have continued to carry out shocking 
     and horrifying violence, including clear and documented war 
     crimes against Palestinians in Gaza. It does not even so much 
     as acknowledge the overwhelming loss of life of Palestinians.
       The Israeli military has already targeted Palestinian 
     residential buildings, in some cases wiping out entire 
     generations of the same Palestinian family, killed over 2,000 
     children, attacked first responders, demolished mosques, and 
     bombed schools. The Meeks McCaul resolution fails to name or 
     address any of these war crimes, or to even acknowledge that 
     Palestinian civilians have been killed by the Israeli 
     military.
       Several days ago, after this resolution was introduced, the 
     Israeli Air Force announced that it had dropped 6,000 bombs 
     on Gaza in six days. Experts have said that this means Israel 
     has dropped, in less than a week, the same amount of bombs 
     that the U.S. dropped in a year of war in Afghanistan--and in 
     a much smaller and more densely populated area. Those of us 
     who want to build a future toward peace must wake up and 
     speak out against this.
       Israeli officials themselves have stated clearly that they 
     are carrying out collective punishment of Palestinians in 
     Gaza and use dehumanizing rhetoric that fuels the violence. 
     Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said: ``I have 
     ordered a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no 
     water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human 
     animals, and we act accordingly.'' As members of Congress, it 
     is our moral obligation not to support or echo these calls.
       Last Friday, after this resolution was introduced, the 
     Israeli military called for all civilians of Gaza City--1.1 
     million people--to relocate south within 24 hours, as it 
     amassed tanks for an expected ground invasion. The UN 
     responded that evacuating everyone was impossible, with power 
     supplies cut and food and water running short after Israel 
     placed Gaza under total siege, and said this would have 
     ``devastating humanitarian consequences.'' The scale of 
     atrocities is enormous.
       Doctors Without Borders staff say that painkillers and 
     anesthesia for operations have run out in Gaza, and sick 
     patients are screaming in pain while they also face the 
     looming threat of bombardment. They have called on Israel to 
     ``show humanity''--and we in Congress must do the same.
       More quotes from Israeli government officials reflecting 
     dehumanizing and violent rhetoric, and intentions to carry 
     out collective punishment against Palestinians in Gaza:
       ``I have ordered a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, 
     no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are 
     fighting human animals, and we act accordingly.'' Israeli 
     Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant
       ``This is a war between the children of light and the 
     children of darkness . . . It will be a deadly war.'' Israeli 
     Defense Minister Yoav Gallant
       ``Humanitarian aid to Gaza? No electrical switch will be 
     turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck 
     will enter until the Israeli abductees are returned home.'' 
     Israeli Minister of Energy Israel Katz
       ``Gaza will eventually turn into a city of tents. There 
     will be no buildings.'' Israeli security official
       ``I say to the residents of Gaza: leave now because we will 
     operate forcefully everywhere.'' Israeli Prime Minister 
     Netanyahu. Palestinian civilians are literally unable to flee 
     or leave, because they are trapped under a 16-year Israeli 
     military siege.
       ``Right now, one goal: Nakba! A Nakba that will overshadow 
     the Nakba of 48.'' Israeli Member of the Knesset Ariel 
     Kallner, referring to 1948 when hundreds of thousands of 
     Palestinians were forcibly displaced from their homes and 
     land.
       ``It's time to be cruel.'' Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel 
     Smotrich
       ``We need to deliver a blow that has not been seen for 50 
     years and take down Gaza.'' Israeli Member of the Knesset 
     Haim Katz
       ``Hamas has opened the gates of hell into the Gaza strip.'' 
     Head of the Israeli Coordination of Government Activities in 
     the Territories
       Specifics notes on the resolution:
       ``Whereas on October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a 
     massive, unprovoked war on Israel by air, land, and sea, 
     including firing thousands of rockets;''
       This whereas clause decontextualizes this violence, which 
     did not begin on Saturday. Between January and September 
     2023, Israel killed 227 Palestinians, according to the UN. 
     Israeli settlers have rampaged throughout Palestinian 
     communities, torching houses and killing people. Entire 
     Palestinian communities have been driven from their homes by 
     Israeli settler violence. Israel has repeatedly attacked the 
     more than 2 million Palestinians living under its more than 
     16-year siege of Gaza, killing thousands of Palestinian 
     civilians, including hundreds of Palestinian children. 
     Palestinians have endured more than 75 years of brutal 
     Israeli rule, during which time tens of thousands of 
     Palestinians have been killed. They have suffered from the 
     systematic violation of their human rights by Israel since 
     1948 and have been denied their freedom and self-
     determination.
       Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists have killed 
     over 700 Israelis and injured more than 2,500 others;
       The failure of this whereas clause to mention the fact that 
     Israel has killed more than 6,546 Palestinians since October 
     7, including over 2,000 children, is deeply problematic. All 
     human life is precious and sacred. This deliberate erasure of 
     Palestinians killed by Israel is deeply dehumanizing.
       Whereas since October 7, 2023, Hamas is directly 
     responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians;
       This whereas clause blames Palestinians for their own 
     deaths. War crimes go not justify more war crimes. Israel has 
     decided to attack Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by targeting 
     residential buildings, hospitals, ambulances, schools, and 
     mosques in one of the most densely populated places on earth, 
     knowing full well the grievous toll that such attacks will 
     inflict on Palestinian civilians. Israel, especially as the 
     occupying power of the Gaza Strip under international law, is 
     responsible for any violations of human rights and 
     international law it commits, just as Hamas is responsible 
     for any violations that it commits.
       Whereas Hamas used rudimentary, civilian equipment such as 
     bulldozers, paragliders, and rubber boats in its assault on 
     Israel, demonstrating the importance of fully enforcing tight 
     controls on what materials go into the Gaza Strip, including 
     through thorough vetting of assistance;
       This whereas clause advocates for the tightening of 
     Israel's more than 15 year illegal siege against 2 million 
     Palestinian civilians trapped in the Gaza Strip. Imposing 
     collective punishment against civilians by denying them 
     access to food, clean water, electricity, fuel, healthcare 
     and medicine, etc.--all prominent components of Israel's 
     illegal siege on Gaza--is a grave war crime.
       Stands with Israel as it defends itself against the 
     barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists;
       Congress should stand with all victims of violence, not 
     express selective concern for the lives of some but not 
     others. This resolved clause dehumanizes the Palestinian 
     people.
       Mourns the over 700 Israelis killed and over 2,000 others 
     wounded in Hamas' unprovoked attack on Israel;
       The failure to even mention Palestinian deaths in this 
     resolved clause is deeply problematic. Congress should mourn 
     the loss of all civilians killed, including the more than 
     6,546 Palestinians since October 7, including over 2,000 
     children. All human life is precious and sacred. This 
     deliberate erasure of Palestinians killed by Israel is deeply 
     dehumanizing.
       Stands ready to assist Israel with emergency resupply and 
     other security, diplomatic, and intelligence support.
       Congress should be taking steps to save lives and end the 
     violence, not exacerbate the violence by sending additiona1 
     weapons to Israel. Israel is already committing apparent war 
     crimes by targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure in 
     Gaza. Providing Israel with more weapons deepens U.S. 
     complicity in Israeli violence against Palestinian civilians 
     and reinforces the existing, untenable status quo of Israeli 
     oppression of Palestinians.
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to describe the anguish I 
feel in the aftermath of the horrific attack on Israel by Hamas. It 
continues the record I've seen from Hamas for as long as I've been in 
Congress. Under Yasser Arafat, Hamas torpedoed a peace agreement that 
was almost adopted with President Clinton. The pain was magnified 
because we were so close to an agreement for lasting peace. Even though 
optimism for the two-state solution has faded, I still believe it is 
the best chance for long-term peace and security. Ultimately, there is 
no military solution to this conflict.
  I've traveled to Israel several times over the last 25 years and am 
heartsick that the optimism I first encountered there appears to have 
melted away. During my first trip to Israel in 1999, I met at a police 
command center in Ramallah led by both an Israeli officer and a 
Palestinian officer who were working cooperatively towards keeping the 
peace. Now we are on the edge of a humanitarian catastrophe made even 
worse with the widening scope of this war.
  I am deeply concerned for the safety and security of the two million 
civilians in Gaza,

[[Page H5063]]

half of whom are children. Israel cutting off water, electricity, 
medicine, fuel, and humanitarian aid has already created horrific 
consequences. These actions are not recipes for lasting peace in the 
region.
  It was important for President Biden to acknowledge the mistakes that 
America made in our military response to 9/11 in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
We lost our perspective. We overreacted and the world is still paying 
the price.
  I hope the Israeli government pays attention to the President's words 
of caution--to follow international law and responsibilities for the 
rules of war. They must work to avoid civilian casualties.
  As someone who has worked for years trying to solve the water and 
sanitation crisis in Gaza, I know full well the consequences they face.
  As Congress provides funding to deal with this crisis, I hope we can 
redouble our effort for humanitarian assistance, using our leverage to 
urge restraint, and move as quickly as possible to help the Palestinian 
people. I hope there is a humanitarian pause with a corridor for 
civilian safety so that it can allow a reset for food, water and 
medicine, and fuel to help them survive.
  I pray that everyone will work together to avoid having this 
humanitarian crisis spill out in the region and engulfing more people 
and accomplishing nothing.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, cognizant of the 
urgency of the situation in the Middle East and the spirit in which 
this resolution has been put forth.
  As we conscientiously denounce the horrific crimes against humanity 
committed by Hamas, let us remember our ultimate goal of peace, the 
need for diplomacy, as well as our commitment to a two-state solution. 
I regret that the vision of peace between Israel and Palestine by way 
of a two-state solution is not referenced in the resolution. I 
sincerely believe that this non-inclusion risks conveying an incomplete 
representation of our nation's long-standing position on this pressing 
matter at a critical time in our history. The situation in Israel and 
Palestine is highly sensitive, and our response should denounce the 
violation of human rights, while supporting Israeli and Palestinian 
victims. Omitting such judicious principled concepts from our 
resolution could inadvertently give the erroneous impression that we 
have abandoned the Palestinians as well as the two-state solution to 
peace. I called these issues to the attention of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee in a letter delivered to the committee on October 12, 2023.
  To this end and because I had no hand in drafting the resolution, I 
propose that we amend the resolution under consideration to include the 
following: ``Whereas the U.S. House of Representatives desires lasting 
peace between Israel and Palestine.'', ``Whereas the two-state solution 
has and continues to be the best path to lasting peace.'', ``Whereas we 
mourn the deaths and suffering of babies as well as innocent 
Palestinian and Israeli people of all ages.'', ``Whereas our support 
for humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian babies and innocent 
civilian Palestinian people is a necessity.'', and ``Resolved that the 
House of Representatives desires a two-state solution that leads to 
peace between Israel and Palestine.''
  The resolution without these principle points will lead me, as a 
matter of conscience, to not vote ``yea.'' I realize that on this vote 
I may stand alone. However, on votes of conscience I believe it is 
better to stand alone than not stand at all.
  As we witness the calls for war, let us remember our moral imperative 
to stand for peace at the genesis of war. Doing so will make clear our 
unwavering commitment to not only Israel's defense but also to the 
ultimate vision of peace that we all wish to see materialize in the 
region.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in the immediate aftermath of the 
horrific October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel by Hamas militants, I co-
sponsored H. Res. 771 in solidarity with the people of Israel. The 
resolution was intended to send an immediate message of bipartisan 
support. Unfortunately, Republican dysfunction (inability to elect a 
speaker of the House) prevented the resolution from moving to the floor 
for nearly three weeks.
  In the interim, as the conflict deepened, my Republican colleagues 
refused to update the text of the resolution to reference the 
humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the civilian casualties in both Israel 
and Gaza. While I support many of the goals of this resolution, 
Congress must recognize that the suffering from this war is not one-
sided.
  As I will vote present on this resolution, I hope that Congress can 
put partisanship aside, helping Israel and pushing Hamas to work toward 
an immediate ceasefire--or, at minimum, a temporary cessation of 
hostilities to protect civilians, transport humanitarian aid, and 
secure the safe return of all hostages.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 771, the 
bipartisan resolution condemning the heinous October 7 terrorist 
attacks by Hamas that have resulted in the senseless deaths of 
Israelis, Palestinians, and more than 30 American citizens. Hundreds 
remain missing and many are held hostage--including women, children, 
and even infants.
  Savage attacks killing innocent civilians are never justified, and 
the Hamas attacks of October 7 were perpetrated against Israeli 
communities for the goal of annihilation. These crimes cross a red line 
and must be unequivocally condemned as they are clear violations of 
international human rights law.
  Israel has a right to defend its citizens from this Hamas terrorism. 
But Israel's response must be proportional and consider the innocent 
Palestinian lives at stake in Gaza. In the past two weeks, we have seen 
an escalating wave of violence across the region. It is clear that a 
broader conflict must be prevented. That is why I have publicly called 
on President Biden to work with all involved parties on negotiating an 
immediate regional ceasefire to avoid the loss of more innocent lives. 
A one-sided ceasefire is not sustainable and will fail. It must include 
Israel, Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, and other parties, with the 
support of the international community.
  The international community must also continue working together to 
facilitate critical humanitarian aid to Gaza--the population of which 
is nearly half children--so Palestinians have access to food, water, 
medicine, and fuel.
  I also recognize that this violence is not just a far-away matter; it 
is hitting close to home. Many families here in the United States and 
overseas are living in unimaginable fear while mourning those they have 
lost. I am hearing from many Jewish constituents and community leaders 
who are in pain and who have loved ones among the injured, killed, or 
missing. I commend the U.S. State Department for their work bringing 
Americans home from Israel, but more work needs to be done--there are 
American citizens in Gaza who seek to come home and have been prevented 
from doing so.
  I am deeply saddened and outraged about the brutal murder of an 
innocent six-year-old boy in Illinois, because he happened to be 
Palestinian-American. The violent, hate-filled targeting of Wadea AI-
Fayoume or anyone else based on ethnicity or religious affiliation is 
unconscionable and should be condemned by everyone. Hate has no place 
in America, and Antisemitism and lslamophobia must not be tolerated.
  It is my hope for the future that every Israeli child and every 
Palestinian child to be tucked into bed at night by their parents 
without fear of bombings and perpetual violence. All people deserve 
safety and security, and the only sustainable path forward is one where 
international human rights and international law are at the forefront 
and democratic ideals are upheld.

I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to 
and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or debate.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The preamble was agreed to.
  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in the Record of 
October 19, 2023, under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')
  Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, 1 week ago, I came to this floor to try 
and pass this very resolution that condemns the violent, genocidal, 
anti-Semitic rhetoric and actions on our college campuses all across 
this country. Sadly, I was blocked by one of my Democratic colleagues. 
And since then, the situation at our universities has only worsened.
  I offer you just two examples. I could multiply these examples, 
sadly, but let's just take two.
  On Tuesday of this week, just 2 or 3 miles from where we stand now on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate, at the George Washington University, pro-
Hamas students projected onto the side of the university library 
various anti-Semitic, anti-Israel, pro-genocide slogans, including 
``Glory to Our Martyrs,'' in reference to the terrorists who attacked 
the State of Israel, and not just the State of Israel, but who 
committed cold-blooded murder of babies, cutting off their heads, 
shooting women and children in their homes, executing soldiers as they 
lay sleeping in their barracks.
  These same students projected other slogans onto the library wall: 
``Free Palestine From the River to the Sea''.
  What does that mean? Well, it is a reference to Hamas's longstanding 
call for the extermination of the State of Israel.
  Let's just be clear. This is a reference to their call for genocide 
of Jews in the Middle East and everywhere they can get their hands on 
them. This is what is going on, on our college campuses.
  If you talk to the students who were there at George Washington 
University

[[Page S5201]]

that night, what they will tell you is, they feared for their safety; 
they feared for their lives; they don't know if they are any longer 
welcome on campus or physically safe on campus.
  What did the university do in the wake of this attack? Well, the 
answer has become all too familiar. Virtually nothing. They issued a 
statement saying that the students weren't authorized to project these 
genocidal slogans onto the library wall, and that is about it.
  We have to do a heck of a lot better than that.
  Last night, at Cooper Union, an institution of higher education in 
the State of New York, Jewish students were barricaded inside their own 
library as a pro-Hamas group rampaged through the building shouting 
violent slurs at these students and then pounded on the library doors 
seeking to gain entrance.
  This morning's New York Post reads: ``Cooper Union barricades Jewish 
students inside library as pro-Palestinian protesters bang on [the] 
doors.''
  The students who were there last night spoke of being herded into the 
library, of campus security saying they didn't think they could protect 
them; campus security then locking the doors to the library to try and 
keep the Jewish students inside and an angry mob assembling.
  There are photos of this. Don't take my word for it. The video is 
available everywhere. Go look for yourself.
  An angry mob of pro-Palestinian, pro-Hamas students were banging on 
the windows--the glass windows--of the library at the Jewish students 
who were literally barricaded inside.
  These students were calling 9-1-1, calling their relatives, asking 
for help. Eventually, an hour or more later, campus security reportedly 
took them out through the back door. They couldn't walk out the front 
door of a library in their own school. They had to be taken out the 
back for fear, I guess, of their safety, perhaps also for appearances.
  I can't help but think, 50 years ago, 60 years ago, the President of 
the United States had to activate the 101st Airborne Division to make 
sure African-American students could go to class in this country 
without being physically assaulted. Is that what it has come to now on 
America's college campuses?
  Are we going to have to activate the National Guard to see that 
Jewish students can go to class in safety without being in fear of 
their lives?
  I would just say this: As a nation, we must speak with one voice and 
say that there is a right, and there is a wrong; there is good, and 
there is evil; and threatening to kill an entire class of people is 
wrong and it is evil.
  Speaking up, shouting in support of genocide is wrong, and it is 
evil. Threatening the lives of your fellow students because they are 
Jewish is wrong, and it is evil.
  Plainly, these institutions of so-called higher learning have failed 
these students. These students have clearly no idea what right and 
wrong means. You project stuff like this on a library wall while your 
Jewish classmates stand in fear for their lives, you don't have any 
idea about what right and wrong is.
  Clearly, these institutions have failed these students, which is why 
we need to speak with moral clarity now. This is a teachable moment. 
This is a moment for us to say that genocide is wrong, that terrorist 
attacks against Jews are wrong, that threats on the lives of Jewish 
people anywhere--the Middle East, in this country, Europe, anywhere--is 
wrong.
  This shouldn't be hard. But we have to do it so that these students 
and everywhere within the sound of our voice can understand what right 
and wrong means--can understand the moral gravity of the situation we 
are now confronting.
  That is why what we are doing today matters, and that is why I am 
pleased today that we are able now, finally, to pass this resolution 
that explicitly names the rhetoric, explicitly calls out the language 
of pro-violence, pro-genocide, and says that is wrong.
  Now, I want to be clear. Our First Amendment--of which I am a great 
defender--our First Amendment allows people to say the most terrible 
things--vile, horrible, reprehensible things. The First Amendment, as I 
have often said, is the right to be wrong. And these students are 
absolutely wrong.
  So they may have the right to say these things--although I must add, 
nobody has the right to threaten violence against other Americans or 
anybody within their ambit. They may have the right to say terrible 
things, to say that they are in favor of genocide, to say that they 
want to see Jewish people killed. They may have the right to say those 
things, but that doesn't mean that we have to agree with it. That 
doesn't mean that we have to say: Oh, that is morally neutral. Sure, 
you can say it, fine. We have no opinion.
  No, no, no. The answer to that kind of hateful, virulent, dangerous 
speech is speech with moral purpose. It is language with moral clarity. 
It is a moral stand that says: No, that is wrong. That is not us. That 
is not the United States of America. That is what we are doing right 
here, right now, on this floor today.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.
  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of 
rule IX, I seek recognition to give notice of my intention to raise a 
question of the privileges of the House.
  The form of the resolution is as follows:
  A resolution censuring Representative Rashida Tlaib for anti-Semitic 
activity, sympathizing with terrorist organizations, and leading an 
insurrection at the United States Capitol complex.
  Whereas, in May 2019, Rashida Tlaib said that she celebrated the 
Holocaust and felt a ``calming feeling'' when thinking about the 
genocide of millions of Jews;
  Whereas, in 2020, Rashida Tlaib retweeted an illustration with the 
caption, ``From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,'' and 
this Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, slogan has been adopted by 
Hamas and calls for the elimination of Israel and death to all Jews;
  Whereas, in September 2022, Rashida Tlaib, as a member of the 
Congressional Progressive Caucus, displayed her disdain for Israel, 
saying: ``You cannot claim to hold progressive values yet back Israel's 
apartheid government'';
  Whereas, instead of denouncing the horrors of Hamas slaughtering 
Israelis and demanding the release of all hostages held by Hamas, 
Rashida Tlaib stated on October 8, 2023: ``The path to the future must 
include lifting the blockade, ending the occupation, and dismantling 
the apartheid system that creates the suffocating, dehumanizing 
conditions that can lead to resistance'';
  Whereas, Rashida Tlaib exhibited her hatred for America by reposting 
a message on October 12, 2023, blaming America for allowing the deaths 
of Palestinian babies at the hands of Israel;
  Whereas, Rashida Tlaib led an insurrection at the United States 
Capitol complex on October 18, 2023, which put Members of Congress, 
their staffs, and Capitol visitors in danger by shutting down 
elevators, stairwells, and points of egress, while obstructing official 
business in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, including 
a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing;
  Whereas, the insurrection led by Rashida Tlaib was organized by 
Jewish Voice for Peace, which the Anti-Defamation League calls ``a 
radical anti-Israel activist group that advocates for a complete 
economic, cultural, and academic boycott of the State of Israel'' and 
that believes ``Israeli policies and actions are motivated by deeply 
rooted Jewish racial chauvinism and religious supremacism'';
  Whereas, members of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a far-left 
nonprofit organization, were present at the insurrection at the Capitol 
on October 18, 2023;
  Whereas, several insurrectionists at the Capitol belong to a group 
messaging chat called ``Global Intifada,'' which is the Arabic word for 
``rebellion'' or ``uprising,'' and refers to a series of protests and 
violent riots carried out by Palestinians in Israel during the last 
century;
  Whereas, by leading an anti-American and anti-Semitic insurrection on 
October 18, 2023, Rashida Tlaib followed Hezbollah's orders to carry 
out a ``day of unprecedented anger'' following an explosion at a Gazan 
hospital, lying about Israel's responsibility for the attack, which 
United States intelligence agencies said was not perpetrated by Israel; 
and
  Whereas, Members of Congress who denounce the United States while 
praising terrorist organizations are unfit to hold office:
  Now, therefore, be it resolved that Representative Rashida Tlaib be 
censured; Representative Rashida Tlaib forthwith present herself in the 
well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure; 
and Representative Rashida Tlaib be censured with the public reading of 
this resolution by the Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Fitzgerald). Under rule IX, a resolution 
offered from the floor by a Member other than the majority leader or 
the minority leader as a question of the privileges of the House has 
immediate precedence only at a time designated by the Chair within 2 
legislative days after the resolution is properly noticed.
  Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the 
gentlewoman from Georgia will appear in the Record at this point.
  The Chair will not at this point determine whether the resolution 
constitutes a question of privilege. That determination will be made at 
the time designated for consideration of the resolution."

     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Peace and Tolerance in 
     Palestinian Education Act''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) In 2016 and 2017, the Palestinian Authority published 
     modified curricula for school-aged children in grades 1 
     through 11.
       (2) Textbooks used by the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the 
     West Bank and Gaza include graphics portraying violence 
     against Israeli soldiers, positive portrayals of individuals 
     who have committed attacks against citizens of Israel, and 
     references to Palestinian efforts to target the ``Zionists''.
       (3) PA textbooks are used at schools sponsored by the 
     United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) because UNRWA 
     schools use the textbooks of the host government.
       (4) On April 26, 2018, the Government Accountability Office 
     (GAO) published a report that found the following:
       (A) Textbooks in PA schools feature inaccurate and 
     misleading maps of the region and include militaristic, 
     adversarial imagery and content that incite hatred.
       (B) The Department of State raised with Palestinian 
     officials the objectionable content in textbooks, including a 
     specific math problem using the number of Palestinian 
     casualties in the First and Second Intifadas.
       (C) The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), in 
     its review of the textbooks, identified content not aligned 
     with United Nations values, the majority of which content 
     related to neutrality or bias issues, including issues 
     related to maps and references to Jerusalem as the capital of 
     Palestine.

     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that the Palestinian Authority 
     has not sufficiently eliminated content and passages 
     encouraging violence or intolerance toward other countries or 
     ethnic groups from the curriculum used in their schools.

     SEC. 4. REPORTS REQUIRED.

       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
     the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter for two 
     years in accordance with subsection (c), the Secretary of 
     State shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
     House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign 
     Relations of the Senate a report reviewing curriculum, 
     including textbooks, leaflets, pamphlets, magazines, and 
     other instructional materials, used in schools in areas 
     controlled by the Palestinian Authority or located in Gaza 
     and controlled by any other entity. Each such report shall 
     include the following:
       (1) A determination of whether there is content or passages 
     encouraging violence or intolerance toward other countries or 
     ethnic groups in such curriculum, and a detailed explanation 
     of the reasons for reaching such determination.
       (2) An assessment of the steps the Palestinian Authority is 
     taking to reform such curriculum at schools to conform with 
     standards of peace and tolerance in the Declaration of 
     Principles on Tolerance by the United Nations Educational, 
     Scientific and Cultural Organization (adopted November 16, 
     1995).
       (3) A determination whether United States foreign 
     assistance is used, directly or indirectly, to fund the 
     dissemination of such curriculum by the Palestinian 
     Authority.
       (4) A detailed report on how United States assistance is 
     being used to address curriculum that encourages violence or 
     intolerance toward other nations or ethnic groups.
       (5) A detailed report about United States diplomatic 
     efforts in the preceding five years to encourage peace and 
     tolerance in Palestinian education.
       (6) If any diplomatic efforts referred to in paragraph (5) 
     were stopped by the Secretary of State, the reasons for such 
     stoppages.
       (b) Public Availability.--The Secretary of State shall post 
     on a publicly available website of the Department of State 
     each report required under subsection (a).
       (c) Subsequent Deadlines.--Each report required by 
     subsection (a), other than the first such report, shall be 
     submitted not later than 90 days after the date on which a 
     new school year begins for schools controlled by the 
     Palestinian Authority.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Lawler) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider) each

                             General Leave

  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New York?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3266, the Peace and Tolerance 
in Palestinian Education Act.
  I thank my colleague, Mr. Sherman, for introducing this important 
legislation to prevent the spread of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic 
hatred.
  We have known for decades that Palestinian children are taught from a 
young age to hate Israel and the Jewish people. Despite robust 
international discussion about these concerns, reports by 
nongovernmental organizations continue to show that Palestinian 
schoolchildren are being indoctrinated with deeply disturbing violent 
imagery.
  For example, a review of the textbooks used in Palestinian schools in 
2020 and 2021 showed that children are taught to read with passages 
that describe suicide bombings and the gruesome murders of IDF 
soldiers, to do math using numbers of martyrs and jihadists, and to 
learn history by asking them to discuss how the USA took advantage of 
the 9/11 attack.
  These textbooks propagate the lie that the Jewish people control the 
media and politics and explicitly refer to Jews as ``enemies of Islam 
in all times and places.'' Children are taught to glorify the founders 
of the jihad movement and learn that jihad is ``a private obligation 
for every Muslim.''
  We will never arrive at a peaceful solution for Israelis and 
Palestinians as long as Palestinian children are being taught hatred in 
textbooks.
  Look at the brutal attack that over 2,500 Hamas terrorists carried 
out against Israel on October 7. Why else would Hamas terrorists call 
home bragging that they murdered Jews? Why else would they live stream 
their barbaric attacks?
  That disgusting and gruesome cruelty is possible because these Hamas 
fighters were indoctrinated with hatred at a young age. They were 
taught to glorify terrorism and other so-called martyrs who killed 
Jewish people. This must end.
  The Peace and Tolerance in Palestinian Education Act takes a first 
step to firmly establish Congress' position that the Palestinian 
Authority has not sufficiently eliminated inciteful and violent content 
from their educational curricula. It also requires the State Department 
to report to Congress on educational materials used in schools run by 
the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, Hamas, and the Gaza Strip, 
and UNRWA.
  A United States Government assessment of the content of these 
educational materials will carry tremendous weight in international 
efforts to eliminate hateful content and promote peace.
  Since Hamas' attack, we have seen an appalling number of anti-Semitic 
and anti-Israel riots around the world and right here at home. I have 
condemned these in the strongest terms. I continue to speak out when 
they occur, and I have encouraged my colleagues to do the same.
  That is why, earlier this year, I introduced legislation to combat 
the rise in anti-Semitism on college campuses, the Stop Anti-Semitism 
on College Campuses Act, which would defund institutions of higher 
learning that allow, promote, or sanction anti-Semitic events on their 
campuses.
  That is why, just last week, Josh Gottheimer and I introduced the 
Antisemitism Awareness Act, which would amend the education law to 
require the Department of Education to use the IHRA definition of anti-
Semitism on its enforcement actions of discrimination laws.
  The commitment we made after the Holocaust, ``Never again,'' is being 
put to the test. We have a responsibility to prevent the teaching of 
anti-Semitism not just here in the United States but around the globe. 
This bipartisan bill uses the tools available to the United States 
Government to do just that.

[[Page H5200]]

  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this 
measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, the United States and many of our allies have long been 
concerned about Palestinian textbooks that contain blatant anti-Semitic 
and anti-Zionist references that incite hatred and violence toward the 
Jewish people.
  In May, the European Parliament went so far as to pass a resolution 
condemning the Palestinian Authority over the hateful content of its 
textbooks and conditioned future funding for education on the removal 
of that anti-Semitic material.
  The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, known as UNRWA, which 
administers many schools in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, is 
required by its mandate to use host country books.
  Let me say that again in another way. UNRWA does not write 
Palestinian textbooks, the Palestinians do, and UNRWA is required to 
use the host nation's book under its mandate.
  The bill before us tasks the Secretary of State to write a report to 
Congress that reviews the curriculum, including textbooks, leaflets, 
pamphlets, magazines, and other instructional materials used in UNRWA 
schools. This report will be important and will help both the Congress 
and the executive branch understand the full scope of the problems, 
work to improve these textbooks, and remove the content that is not 
only untrue but leads to further violence and instability in the 
region.
  I will add one more important comment about UNRWA. Despite the issue 
related to the Palestinian Authority's textbooks that we are discussing 
at this moment, thousands of UNRWA employees, many of whom have 
yearslong relationships with the U.S., remain in Gaza doing dangerous 
humanitarian work. Some have, sadly, lost their lives.
  Let's keep them in mind as this conflict continues, but let's also 
keep in mind that Israel must defeat Hamas.
  I am proud to cosponsor this legislation and ask my colleagues to 
vote in support of this important bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1530

  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Mast), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on 
Oversight and Accountability.
  Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak specifically, as both sides 
have mentioned, as to what goes on in this education within these 
UNRWA/Palestinian Authority-run schools. People can find images of 
these. Nobody is going to be able to see them on camera. Let's read 
them specifically.
  An example of a fourth grade Palestinian math problem: ``The number 
of martyrs in the First Intifada is 2,026 martyrs, and the number of 
martyrs of the Al-Aqsa Intifada is 5,050 martyrs. The number of martyrs 
in the two intifadas is_____ martyrs?''
  This is another example, a seventh grade physics problem people can 
look at, and we can find many examples of this. This is on Newton's 
second law: ``During the first Palestinian uprising, Palestinian youths 
used slingshots to confront the soldiers of the Zionist occupation and 
defend themselves from their treacherous bullets. What is the 
relationship between the elongation of the slingshot's rubber and the 
tensile strength affecting it?'' This is their physics work.
  Another example, again, from Palestinian Authority-run schools in 
conjunction with the United Nations, a geography question. This one 
asks sixth graders to define the borders of Palestine which completely 
erase the existence of Israel.
  They are not interested in a two-state solution. I agree. I don't 
think a two-state solution is a good idea, but they are interested in a 
one-state solution in which no Israel exists at all. That is what is 
being taught in the schools, and that is what no U.S. taxpayer dollars 
should be sent to support at all. That is the purpose of the request 
for the information on what is going on with this U.N.-funded 
education.
  I just offer the reminder that these are not Hamas-run schools. They 
are not Palestinian-Islamic Jihad-run schools. They are not Al-Aqsa 
Martyrs Brigade-run schools. They are not Lions' Den-run schools. They 
are Palestinian Authority-run schools, what we could consider the 
Palestinian government; the Palestinian government that at one point 
has been a majority of Hamas members in that government.
  In these Palestinian authority-run schools, this is their government 
teaching. It is the U.N. teachings. This is what the teachers--maybe 
not considered Hamas, but let's consider them rank-and-file 
Palestinians--are teaching the students. This is what the rank-and-file 
students across the area are learning. This is what their parents are 
seeing them taught. I think this is what we are seeing be professed by 
extremists across Times Square, Harvard, Tulane, and other places, and 
I consider it extremely anti-Semitic and dangerous.
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Sherman), a senior member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee and, importantly, the author of this legislation.
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have been working on this bill for a long 
time. I introduced it in the 116th Congress and the 117th Congress, and 
both times it passed unanimously in the Foreign Affairs Committee. Now, 
finally, in the 118th Congress, we have it to the floor. I thank Mr. 
Mast from Florida for being the Republican lead on this bill and 
speaking for it here on the floor. Now, as I said, this bill passed 
unanimously three times through our committee, and I hope it passes 
unanimously by voice vote here on the floor.
  Let us reflect on what has happened recently in Israel. Our Secretary 
of State, Tony Blinken, I think, summarized it well in his testimony 
yesterday: Young people chased down and gunned down at a dance party. 
Children executed in front of their parents. Parents executed in front 
of their children. Families in final embrace burned alive. People 
beheaded.
  There was a family of four, a boy and a girl of 6 and 8 years old and 
their parents, around the breakfast table. The father's eye was gouged 
out in front of his children, the mother's breasts were cut off, the 
girl's foot was amputated, and the boy's finger was cut off before they 
were executed. Then the executioners sat down and had a meal.
  We heard an intercepted telephone call where a terrorist called his 
mother and said gleefully: ``I have killed 10 Jews with my own hands. 
I'm using the dead Jewish woman's phone to call you now.''
  How does such a horror occur? It occurs when generations are raised 
to hate, to kill, to behead, to murder, and it is a product of the 
schools that we have seen for decades on the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip.
  I point to a particular fifth grade textbook which glorifies a 
terrorist who in 1978 went forward and killed 38 Israeli civilians, 
including 13 children, many of them pictured here. This is who is 
glorified. This is who is held up to Palestinian children as the model 
for them to follow.
  We should not be surprised that there is, therefore, significant 
support for the Hamas doctrine: ``From the river to the sea . . . '' 
All Jews must be killed; that is their position. That is what holds 
their organization together.
  I know the scenes that come now from Gaza are horrific. People say: 
``Let's stop the fighting. Let's have a cease-fire.'' Well, what would 
happen then? We don't have to wonder, because just today, Ghazi Hamad, 
a high-ranking official of Hamas, said exactly what would happen. He 
said: We will repeat October 7 one, two, three, four, five times, as 
many times as it takes, until Israel is annihilated.

  That is what happens if we have a cease-fire, unless we have the kind 
of cease-fire that we should have, one in which Hamas releases all the 
hostages and disarms. Then we can have a cease-fire.
  In the years to come, after the actions being taken in Gaza, we will 
again wonder: Is another generation being educated to repeat these 
crimes in future years?
  How are these students educated? They are educated in schools run by 
UNRWA, the U.N. organization, and paid for in large part by the United 
States. While we have responsibilities

[[Page H5201]]

around the world, the oil-rich Arab states contribute only a portion, a 
small portion of what UNRWA spends. America contributes half and more 
than half.
  When we resumed funding for UNRWA in 2021, it was with the 
understanding that the schools would change, and we reached the 2021 
framework for cooperation. So far, not so good. It appears as if the 
books continue.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from California.
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, what this bill does is requires a formal 
report to tell us what, unfortunately, we know informally, and that is 
that education for terrorism has continued.
  With this formal report on its way, UNRWA will understand that what 
is happening in its schools will be exposed and that the American 
Congress will not continue to fund them if they don't meet the 
responsibilities.
  Now, it is said that they have to rely on Palestinian Authority 
textbooks. No, they simply have to change their policy.
  I look forward to meeting the humanitarian and educational needs of 
the Palestinian people in a way that builds toward peace, not in a way 
that holds out to Palestinian fifth graders as an example someone who 
would kill 38 civilians, including 13 children.
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. Manning), the vice ranking member of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative Brad 
Schneider, for yielding me time.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support H.R. 3266, the Peace and Tolerance 
in Palestinian Education Act, bipartisan legislation I cosponsored, 
introduced by Representatives Brad Sherman and Brian Mast.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill is necessary because we continue to see the 
use of textbooks and other educational materials in schools run by the 
PA and UNRWA containing anti-Israel content which perpetuates anti-
Semitism, victimhood, and martyrdom, erases Israel from the map, and 
even glorifies violence and terrorism.
  Children in the West Bank and Gaza deserve the chance to learn 
without using textbooks that are biased, promote intolerance, and 
demonize or mischaracterize Israel.
  That is why this bill would require the State Department to 
investigate, report to Congress, and make publicly available important 
information about the content of the curriculum used in these schools.
  The PA and UNRWA have a responsibility to address and remove 
problematic content in textbooks that violates the U.N.'s own 
principles of neutrality and tolerance.
  We know that no child is born to hate. They have to be carefully 
taught. Educational materials that teach them hate by demonizing Israel 
only make it harder to resolve the conflict and achieve lasting peace.
  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this 
important bipartisan bill that I am proud to cosponsor.
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume 
for the purpose of closing.
  Mr. Speaker, my colleague Mr. Sherman made mention of the stated 
intent of the terrorist scheme to destroy Israel, to try again and 
again. I want to share an email I got today talking about what is going 
on right now.
  It says: Among the IDF soldiers killed in Gaza yesterday, eight were 
in a single armored personnel carrier that was hit by a rocket-
propelled grenade. They were part of the Givati infantry brigade. One 
of them, 2nd Lt. Pedayah Mark, lost his father in a terror attack on 
their family car near Otneil 7 years ago. Pedayah, who was 13 years old 
at the time, was injured along with his mother. His uncle was among 
those murdered in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7.
  The terrorists continue to attack and attack, oftentimes striking the 
same family. We need to make sure we change what the kids are learning.
  H.R. 3266 is an important tool in our fight against the hatred and in 
support of peace in Palestinian education, the education of the 
children.
  Let me add one more statistic. In the attack on October 7, 20 
children under 18 were orphaned, both their parents were killed. 
Eighteen young people between the age of 18 and 25 lost both parents. 
Ninety-six children under 18 lost one parent.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues, every one of them, to support 
this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  We must continue to stand against anti-Semitism and anti-Israel bias. 
It is essential that we ensure children are not taught to hate, and 
this starts with the materials they learn in school.
  The first step is passing the bipartisan Peace and Tolerance in 
Palestinian Education Act, to ensure we have transparent, valid, and 
authenticated information.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 3266.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table."

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 798) condemning the support of Hamas, Hezbollah, 
and other terrorist organizations at institutions of higher education, 
which may lead to the creation of a hostile environment for Jewish 
students, faculty, and staff, as amended.
  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.
  The text of the resolution is as follows:

                              H. Res. 798

       Whereas both Hamas and Hezbollah are recognized by the 
     United States Department of State as Foreign Terrorist 
     Organizations;
       Whereas, on October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a surprise 
     attack to deliberately target Israeli civilians, including 
     the killing and abduction of men, women, children, and the 
     elderly;
       Whereas Hamas' stated goal is the entire destruction of the 
     State of Israel and the murder of its Jewish citizens;
       Whereas a disturbing number of student organizations at 
     institutions of higher education placed blame solely upon the 
     State of Israel for the attack and expressed support for the 
     terrorist actions of Hamas through the glorification of 
     violence and the usage of antisemitic rhetoric;
       Whereas on October 9, 2023, the national leadership of 
     Students for Justice in Palestine declared a ``day of 
     resistance'' calling on student chapters across the United 
     States to demonstrate by ``not just slogans and rallies, but 
     armed confrontation with oppressors'' and following this 
     announcement many chapters issued pro-Hamas statements;
       Whereas on October 10, 2023, a Stanford University lecturer 
     targeted Jewish students during a class on colonialism, 
     justifying the actions of Hamas terrorists by calling them 
     ``freedom fighters'' and asking Jewish students to identify 
     themselves and stand in the corner to illustrate what ``Jews 
     were doing to Palestinians'';
       Whereas on October 15, 2023, in a complete disregard for 
     humanity, a Cornell University professor grabbed the 
     microphone at a campus rally and pronounced that, ``Hamas has 
     challenged the monopoly of violence'' and ``it was 
     exhilarating. It was energizing. . .I was exhilarated,'' in 
     reference to Hamas' terror attack on Israel;
       Whereas on October 22, 2023, the Brandeis University 
     student government voted down a simple resolution condemning 
     Hamas and calling on the immediate release of all hostages 
     back to their families unharmed;
       Whereas on October 24, 2023, George Washington University 
     students at a vigil to support Hamas' surprise attack 
     prominently projected signs on the walls of the university's 
     library including, ``Glory to our Martyrs'';
       Whereas many administrations of institutions of higher 
     education do not follow the practice of institutional 
     neutrality and frequently speak out on public issues, but 
     have failed to speak out clearly after the October 7 attack 
     by Hamas, and have exposed their

[[Page H5202]]

     lack of regard for their Jewish and pro-Israel students; and
       Whereas the glorification of violence and usage of 
     antisemitic rhetoric creates a hostile learning and working 
     environment for Jewish students, faculty, and staff: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
       (1) condemns the support of Hamas, Hezbollah, and other 
     terrorist organizations at institutions of higher education, 
     which may lead to the creation of a hostile environment for 
     Jewish students, faculty, and staff;
       (2) calls on campus administrators--
       (A) to condemn all forms of antisemitism on college 
     campuses; and
       (B) to ensure Jewish faculty, students, and guests can 
     exercise the same Free Speech rights as are guaranteed to all 
     other faculty, students, and guests without intimidation; and
       (3) urges enforcement of Federal civil rights laws to 
     protect Jewish students from antisemitism.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. Owens) and the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.


                             General Leave

  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 
5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on H. Res. 798, as amended, the resolution now 
under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Utah?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 798, condemning the 
hateful acts of anti-Semitism spreading like wildfire across American 
college campuses.
  Last year, I made my first trip with a few of my colleagues to 
Israel, where we were welcomed by Jewish citizens of all backgrounds--
Black, European, Russian, Arabian, and Palestinian.
  During a visit to a Jewish family's home near the Gaza border, I held 
a bomb fragment that had landed in their front yard. I saw a lifestyle 
where the norm was always being on edge. There were bomb shelters built 
on both ends of elementary soccer fields and at every bus stop.
  One of my colleagues asked our guests: You live so close to people 
who literally hate you simply because of your religion and culture. Why 
do you stay?
  The answer stuck with me: Because I love my country, and this is our 
home.
  None of us could have imagined, a little over a year later, the pure 
evil that would visit that home. They never knew how vulnerable they 
were to satanic barbarism. Those who would film, call home, and bolster 
the torture and death they rained down on innocent, defenseless men, 
women, and children.
  What does evil look like? The German Nazis attempted to hide their 
acts, but these nazis have posted their acts on social media for the 
world to see and remember: a pregnant mother shot in the face, her baby 
cut from her womb and then beheaded; a female raped with such evil 
voracity that her pelvis was broken, and she was then murdered; 
grandmothers, children, and babies huddled together and then burned 
alive; a young 20-year-old woman who was shown half-naked and 
unconscious as she was paraded through the streets of Gaza, tortured 
and desecrated by these cowardly devils. She was later found beheaded.
  Within hours, 1,400 innocent, defenseless men and women, children in 
their bedrooms, and teenagers celebrating peace at a music festival 
were murdered without mercy.
  What was the response on American campuses?
  At Cornell University, a professor called the Hamas attacks 
exhilarating and energizing.
  At George Washington University, less than 4 miles from where I 
stand, students projected the phrases ``from the river to the sea,'' 
and ``glory to our martyrs'' on the side of Gelman Library, a building 
named after a Jewish alumni. These phrases are an explicit anti-Semitic 
call for the violent eradication of Jews in the State of Israel.
  At Cooper Union, Jewish students were forced to lock themselves in 
the library to avoid a rabid mob chanting: ``Murder to the Jews.'' 
These hate-filled college students have no shame and no fear. Imagine 
the accountability they would face if they were chanting: ``Murder to 
the Blacks,'' or ``Murder to the trans.'' As this mob pounded on the 
front door of the building, the Jewish students were quietly ushered 
out the back door.
  This is America 2023, not 1960. No students, regardless of race, 
creed, color, or religion, should ever have to use the back door of a 
campus library out of fear for their safety--not now, not ever in the 
United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker, I stand today to strongly condemn the pure evil of 
Hamas, affirm Israel as our greatest ally in the Middle East, and 
proclaim our unwavering support as they assert their right to self-
defense.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 798, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. I thank 
my colleague, Representative Burgess Owens, for sponsoring this 
resolution condemning support for terrorism and anti-Semitism on 
college campuses.
  Anti-Semitism is a persistent, shape-shifting hatred that is an 
affront to our values as Americans. It should be condemned by all. It 
has no place on college campuses and universities or in our society.
  I am committed to countering anti-Semitism in all its forms as a co-
chair of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti-Semitism 
and as a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee.
  Tragically, anti-Semitism is on the rise across the United States and 
around the world. We have witnessed a particularly disturbing increase 
in anti-Semitic incidents at colleges and universities. According to 
the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic incidents on college and 
university campuses increased by 40 percent from 2021 to 2022.
  Since the horrific terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel on 
October 7, we have witnessed an even greater increase in incidents and 
threats targeting Jewish students across the country--by some accounts, 
a 400 percent increase.
  Students at Cooper Union were barricaded inside a library building. 
Shocking anti-Israel messages were projected onto a building at George 
Washington University. Just yesterday, a Cornell University student was 
arrested and charged for posting horrifying threats online targeting 
Jewish students on campus, threatening to shoot up the kosher dining 
hall, and calling for Jewish students to be eliminated.
  It is also deeply disturbing to witness student-led demonstrations 
and rallies excusing and glorifying the terrorism or expressing 
sympathy for foreign terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, 
groups whose driving ideology is anti-Semitic and which are dedicated 
to the destruction of Israel.

  College and university leaders have a moral responsibility to make 
clear that they reject hatred, violence, and anti-Semitism, to hold 
those responsible for these acts accountable, and to prevent a hostile 
and intimidating environment for Jewish students, faculty, and staff.
  I am grateful for the Biden administration's commitment to fully 
enforce Federal civil rights law prohibiting anti-Semitic 
discrimination and to take steps, including those outlined in the 
``U.S. National Strategy to Counter Anti-Semitism,'' to combat the rise 
of anti-Semitism in higher education.
  Congress should also make clear that we condemn terrorism, anti-
Semitism, and violence and that we remain committed to protecting all 
students.
  Madam Speaker, colleges and universities are places where students 
learn from one another and where they decide who they want to become in 
life. We can respect and uphold Americans' free speech and First 
Amendment rights without tolerating discrimination and hate. No matter 
what your opinion is on foreign policy or any other issue, it does not 
excuse or give anyone a license to engage in hate against any group.
  When anti-Semitism and bias against Jews take hold on campus, it 
deprives students of their equal right to an education and harms 
everyone in the campus community.

[[Page H5203]]

  That is why I am proud to support this resolution condemning support 
for terrorism and anti-Semitism on campuses and calling for protections 
against hate targeting Jews, just as we should for all Americans of any 
background who are facing increased threats.
  Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this 
resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).
  Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 798, a 
resolution condemning anti-Semitism on college campuses and encouraging 
campus leaders to speak out in support of their Jewish students, 
faculty, and guests.
  One word that comes to mind is ``regression.'' The extreme rhetoric 
on college campuses is, sadly, yet another chapter in the troubled 
history between Jewish students and American universities. It started 
with quotas. In 1922, Harvard President Abbott Lowell proposed a cap on 
the number of Jewish enrollees each year. Many other universities 
adopted similar policies.
  Out of Jewish quotas, alternative Jewish education opportunities were 
born. In 1948, Brandeis University was founded. It was named after 
Lowell's great enemy, the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice, Louis 
Brandeis. The initial 107-student class at Brandeis was overwhelmingly 
Jewish and just 12 miles down the road from Cambridge. It stood as a 
stark reminder of ethnic discrimination.
  The world progressed greatly in the post-war period, but the events 
of the past month have ripped open a wound in American postsecondary 
education that had been festering.
  There is no better example than modern Harvard. The coalition student 
group letter from Harvard was the first anti-Semitic demonstration on 
campus to make the news after Hamas' October 7 attack, hearkening back 
to Harvard's Jewish quotas. Harvard is a bellwether, for better or for 
worse.
  H. Res. 798 condemns the support of terrorists and condemns anti-
Semitism behavior. I thank Representative Owens for putting this 
important resolution forward, and I pray that it is a step toward 
reversing the abhorrent behavior that has taken over college campuses.
  Madam Speaker, we must throw anti-Semitism into the dustbin of 
history where it belongs.
  Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).
  Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 
798.
  On October 7, Hamas carried out the largest attack on the Jewish 
people since the Holocaust. Women were brutally raped and murdered; 
babies brutally murdered and decapitated; and innocent civilians 
abducted, tortured, and murdered.
  In the aftermath, we have seen despicable acts of anti-Semitism and 
support for the terrorists across college campuses in this country. 
Students organized protests calling for ``armed confrontation with 
oppressors'' and using imagery reflecting the Hamas terrorists 
paragliding into the music festival in Israel. There are vile chants 
calling for the elimination of Jewish people in the State of Israel. 
There are professors asking Jewish students to identify themselves and 
stand in the corner of a classroom. There are projections on a campus 
building saying, ``Glory to our martyrs,'' referring to the Hamas 
terrorists.

                              {time}  1600

  These are despicable actions, and they have created a hostile 
environment for many Jewish students across our country. This is wholly 
unacceptable, and this is not free speech.
  Jewish students deserve to know they are safe on campus, and colleges 
and universities have a legal and moral obligation to foster an 
environment free from vile anti-Semitic discrimination.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this 
resolution.
  Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. Allen).
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for 
yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor of H. Res. 798, a 
resolution that demands Congress' immediate attention and action in 
condemning the recent surge of support for Hamas, Hezbollah, and other 
terrorist organizations at American universities.
  Let's be clear. The targets of Hamas on October 7 were not Israeli 
military installations. The targets were innocent men, women, and 
children. It was demonic and barbaric.
  What are we seeing on our college campuses?
  This is not just cause for concern, it is an outrageous affront to 
the principles of peace, tolerance, and safety that our educational 
institutions espouse.
  From the explicit endorsements of violence to the violent targeting 
of Jewish students, we are witnessing a blatant disregard for the well-
being and security of young people.
  This is not a matter of political correctness. It is a matter of 
ensuring the safety and dignity of every individual on our college 
campuses. The incidents outlined in this resolution are occurring 
across the Nation and threaten the very fabric of our educational 
institutions. From student organizations calling on fellow students to 
demonstrate with armed confrontation to school administrators failing 
to clearly speak out, it is time to take a stand to safeguard the well-
being of our students and to uphold the principles that our Nation was 
founded on and holds dear.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Hageman). The time of the gentleman has 
expired.
  Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Georgia.
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I implore my colleagues to join me in 
supporting H. Res. 798. We must send a resounding message that we will 
not tolerate the spread of hatred within the halls of our universities.
  Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. Good).
  Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my friend 
from Utah's resolution that denounces terrorism and anti-Semitism at 
universities across this country.
  The world watched in horror on October 7 when Hamas launched their 
unprovoked and brutal terrorist attack on Israel causing the greatest 
single-day of loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust.
  I joined the overwhelming majority of Americans in immediately 
expressing unwavering support for Israel, but, sadly, we have also seen 
an outbreak of support for the perpetrators of terror, Hamas and 
Hezbollah, on our college campuses.
  What are we teaching college students on these campuses, and what 
kind of professors are doing this teaching?
  In my own district, the Students for Justice in Palestine at the 
University of Virginia issued a statement that the violence against 
Israel makes them hopeful for the future of Palestine, implying that 
Israel was somehow deserving of the atrocities committed against them.
  Free speech is protected in this country, but it cannot be used to 
support terrorist actions.
  To the University of Virginia's credit, the president issued a 
statement clearly condemning Hamas. Nevertheless many other university 
administrators were not as definitive in their responses.
  This resolution challenges college administrators to condemn anti-
Semitism and focus on education rather than liberal indoctrination.
  Madam Speaker, I am proud to sponsor this resolution, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this resolution.
  Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. Houchin).
  Mrs. HOUCHIN. Madam Speaker, with regard to Israel, the mask has 
finally come off the woke left whose center of gravity, sadly, is 
situated in American universities.
  Following the barbaric attacks on Israel by Hamas, student groups at 
universities across the country demonstrated support for the 
terrorists.

[[Page H5204]]

  Let me pause to say that again. Demonstrations are happening at 
universities across the United States in support of terrorists.
  A student group at my alma mater, George Washington University, 
called for the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people.
  The liberal ideology is emanating from universities and spreading 
throughout our corporations and tainting the world view of the next 
generation of Americans. This is dangerous and must be rejected.
  That is why I am an original sponsor of Representative Owens' 
resolution condemning the support of terrorists at our institutions of 
higher education.
  I urge all Americans to join me and my colleagues in stating in no 
uncertain terms that we support our Jewish students and affirm the 
statehood of Israel and the right of her people to live and to thrive.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 798.
  Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Kiley).
  Mr. KILEY. Madam Speaker, earlier this year, I drafted a resolution 
condemning anti-Semitism on our college campuses. There had been a 
deeply disturbing rise in anti-Semitic incidents on campuses in 
California and across the country, and also a totally inadequate 
response by university faculty and administration who were unable or 
unwilling to condemn this activity, and sometimes it happened with 
their tacit or even outright support of individual faculty members.
  This has been a growing problem on university campuses. Just a few 
years ago, a task force of university faculty in California was tasked 
with preparing an ethnic studies curriculum for high schools. What they 
produced was a deeply anti-Semitic document that Gavin Newsom condemned 
saying that it was offensive in so many ways it would never see the 
light of day and that the California Legislative Jewish Caucus said 
echoed the propaganda of the Nazi regime.
  Nonetheless, in spite of all of this, nothing could have prepared us 
for what has happened in the aftermath of Hamas' terrorist attack on 
the State of Israel. Nothing could have prepared us for the failure of 
moral leadership where you have university faculty and administration--
which have been all too willing to wade into every political 
controversy of the day with clearly defined views--that have been 
unable to render the most straightforward of moral judgments, to 
condemn in clear language an assault and an attack on innocent men, 
women, children, and babies, an attack on Israel's very right to exist.
  Many student groups taking their cue have now targeted Jewish 
students, and Jewish students are feeling unsafe on our campuses.
  Larry Summers, who is the former president of Harvard and a high-
ranking Obama official, said this on October 9: ``In nearly 50 years of 
Harvard affiliation, I have never been as disillusioned and alienated 
as I am today.
  ``The silence from Harvard's leadership, so far, coupled with a vocal 
and widely reported student groups' statement blaming Israel solely, 
has allowed Harvard to appear at best neutral towards acts of terror 
against the Jewish State of Israel.
  ``Instead, Harvard is being defined by the morally unconscionable 
statement apparently coming from two dozen student groups blaming all 
the violence on Israel. I am sickened.''
  Today's resolution, which is joining mine with one offered by 
Representative Owens, is providing the moral leadership that many of 
our universities have failed to provide. It ``condemns the support of 
Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations at institutions of 
higher education which may lead to the creation of a hostile 
environment for Jewish students, faculty, and staff.''
  It ``calls on campus administrators to condemn all forms of anti-
Semitism on college campuses; and to ensure Jewish faculty, students, 
and guests can exercise the same free speech rights that are guaranteed 
to all other faculty, students, and guests without intimidation. . . . 
`'
  Madam Speaker, it is vitally important that this resolution pass and 
that it do so with strong bipartisan support.
  Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, I acknowledge that my colleague is standing against 
anti-Semitism and that he introduced a measure to require the teaching 
of the Holocaust. I also introduced an amendment at that same hearing. 
My amendment would have prohibited the banning by schools and school 
districts of books about the Holocaust because school districts across 
the country are banning books like ``The Diary of a Young Girl'' by 
Anne Frank and the award-winning graphic novel ``Maus'' because they 
found those books too disturbing.
  This is exactly what we should be talking about in our hearings, that 
we should be teaching students the history of the Holocaust using 
award-winning books because these are the perfect vehicles for making 
sure that students understand what has happened when anti-Semitism has 
been allowed to go unchallenged.
  I thank my colleague for raising this issue in today's setting and 
hope they will continue to support efforts to avoid the banning of 
books on the Holocaust.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. Bean).
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Madam Speaker, as you know, the Holocaust ended 
in 1945, but tragically, the hatred behind it has not.
  We are all horrified by the surge in violent anti-Semitism taking 
place across America. Today we are seeing the full force of Jewish 
contempt on our college and university campuses, and it has never been 
more hateful. Students are being harassed, threatened, and violently 
targeted just for being Jewish in 2023.
  It is unthinkable that students are unable to walk between classes to 
their dorms or the dining hall, but it is the reality for Jewish 
students on campuses today.
  The history of the Holocaust warns us what can happen when hatred is 
met by silence. We cannot stand by while Jewish students feel 
threatened. It is more than just a discussion. It is a call to action.
  Madam Speaker, today I stand before you to condemn these dangerous 
acts of anti-Semitism. That is why I urge everybody to support 
Representative Owens' resolution to condemn support for terrorist 
organizations on campuses across the Nation. Anti-Semitism is not 
activism. It is hatred pure and simple, and it has no place in America 
today.
  Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume 
for the purpose of closing.
  For the past 2 weeks, I have been inundated with phone calls, emails, 
and texts from frantic parents and terrified students who have 
experienced online hate, taunting from their fellow students, exposure 
to swastikas on their dorm walls and doors, chants of death to Israel 
and Jews, and seeing those words chalked on campus walkways. These 
students sat through anti-Israel and anti-Semitism rants by professors 
who were supposed to be teaching them, not spreading anti-Israel 
propaganda.

  Rallies were held by students and others who are ignorant about the 
history of the Middle East and ignorant about the 2,000-year history of 
anti-Semitism.
  Our education system is failing us, and we are seeing it come alive 
on our college campuses. We are seeing that failure at some of the most 
illustrious institutions in my State of North Carolina and at my own 
alma mater in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
  We are seeing the failure and inability of university presidents and 
university chancellors--people who are able to take the simple step of 
condemning terrorism against Israel and of condemning the gruesome 
attack by Hamas on innocent Israeli civilians and the taking of 
hostages--to simply call out and condemn anti-Semitism.
  They do this under the guise of free speech.
  Madam Speaker, I am glad that Members of Congress on both sides of 
the aisle are committed to standing strong against terrorism, anti-
Semitism, and all forms of hate on college campuses. This is critical.

[[Page H5205]]

  This is an important and timely resolution that seeks to call out a 
deeply disturbing pattern of support for terrorism and anti-Semitism 
that we have been seeing on all too many college campuses in recent 
weeks.

                              {time}  1615

  I am appalled by the inability of our institutions of higher 
education to be able to stand up for what is right and to take on the 
initiative to use these incidents as a teaching opportunity. After all, 
what are our colleges and universities for if they are unable to use 
this opportunity to teach about what is right and what is accurate.
  I ask all my colleagues to join me in voting in support of this 
resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, in concluding this discussion, I have five 
words for American colleges: You reap what you sow.
  After failing miserably to condemn student support for terrorism on 
your campuses, Jewish students are now living in fear. The violent 
anti-Semitic protests of students educated on your campuses have 
brought to light what for decades has thrived in the dark.
  Many American universities are fundamentally adrift. Instead of an 
environment of enlightenment and one that unites diverse ideas, they 
have become incubators of hate. They call for inclusion yet exclude the 
Jewish people. They call for neutrality yet stoke the flames of culture 
wars that have brought us here.
  Deep in the humanities department, seas of bigotry have taken root. 
The poison fruits of a sanction ideology are now ripe for all to see. 
In the Committee on Education and the Workforce, we will call out 
rotten ideologies when we find them.
  At this moment, though, we must offer in the clearest terms the 
condemnation of Hamas brutality and violence. Now is the time for 
Congress to shine as an example of moral clarity both at home and 
abroad.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 798, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens) that the House suspend the rules and 
agree to the resolution, H. Res. 798, as amended.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.

proceedings on this motion will be postponed."

  The Clerk read as follows:

                              H. Res. 829

       Whereas in May 2019, Rashida Tlaib said that she celebrated 
     the Holocaust, and felt a ``calming feeling'' when thinking 
     about the genocide of millions of Jews;
       Whereas in 2020, Rashida Tlaib retweeted an illustration 
     with the caption, ``From the river to the sea, Palestine will 
     be free'', and this Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
     slogan has been adopted by Hamas and calls for the 
     elimination of Israel and the death of all Jews;
       Whereas in September 2022, Rashida Tlaib, as a member of 
     the Congressional Progressive Caucus, displayed her disdain 
     for Israel, saying, ``You cannot claim to hold progressive 
     values yet back Israel's apartheid government.'';
       Whereas instead of denouncing the horrors of Hamas 
     slaughtering Israelis and demanding the release of all 
     hostages held by Hamas, Rashida Tlaib stated on October 8, 
     2023, ``The path to the future must include lifting the 
     blockade, ending the occupation, and dismantling the 
     apartheid system that creates the suffocating dehumanizing 
     conditions that can lead to resistance.'';
       Whereas Rashida Tlaib exhibited her hatred for America by 
     reposting a message on October 12, 2023, blaming America for 
     allowing the deaths of Palestinian babies at the hands of 
     Israel;
       Whereas Rashida Tlaib led an insurrection at the United 
     States Capitol Complex on October 18, 2023, which put Members 
     of Congress, their staffs, and Capitol visitors in danger by 
     shutting down elevators, stairwells, and points of egress, 
     while obstructing official business in both the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate, including a Senate Foreign 
     Affairs Committee hearing;
       Whereas the insurrection led by Rashida Tlaib was organized 
     by Jewish Voice for Peace, which the Anti-Defamation League 
     calls ``a radical anti-Israel activist group that advocates 
     for a complete economic, cultural and academic boycott of the 
     state of Israel'', and that believes ``Israeli policies and 
     actions are motivated by deeply rooted Jewish racial 
     chauvinism and religious supremacism.'';
       Whereas members of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a far-
     left nonprofit organization, were present at the insurrection 
     at the Capitol on October 18, 2023;
       Whereas several insurrectionists at the Capitol belong to a 
     group messaging chat called, ``Global Intifada'', which is 
     the Arabic word for ``rebellion'' or ``uprising'', and refers 
     to a series of protests and violent riots carried out by 
     Palestinians in Israel during the last century;
       Whereas by leading an anti-American and antisemitic 
     insurrection on October 18, 2023, Rashida Tlaib followed 
     Hezbollah's orders to carry out a ``day of unprecedented 
     anger'' following an explosion at a Gazan hospital, lying 
     about Israel's responsibility for the attack, which United 
     States intelligence agencies said was not perpetrated by 
     Israel; and
       Whereas Members of Congress who denounce the United States 
     while praising terrorist organizations are unfit to hold 
     office: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That--
       (1) Representative Rashida Tlaib be censured;
       (2) Representative Rashida Tlaib forthwith present herself 
     in the well of the House of Representatives for the 
     pronouncement of censure; and

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of 
rule IX, I seek recognition to give notice of my intent to raise a 
question of the privileges of the House.
  The form of the resolution is as follows:
  Censuring my colleague Representative Rashida Tlaib for anti-Semitic 
activity and sympathizing with terrorist organizations.
  Whereas, in May 2019, Rashida Tlaib said that she celebrated the 
Holocaust, and felt a calming feeling when thinking about the genocide 
of millions of Jews;
  Whereas, in 2020, Rashida Tlaib retweeted an illustration with the 
caption: ``From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,'' and 
this Palestine Liberation Organization slogan has been adopted by Hamas 
and calls for the elimination of Israel and the death of all Jews;
  Whereas, on November 3, 2023, Rashida Tlaib tweeted that the slogan 
``from the river to the sea,'' which calls for the genocide of all 
Jews, ``is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful 
coexistence'';
  Whereas, in September 2022, Rashida Tlaib, as a member of the 
Congressional Progressive Caucus, displayed her disdain for Israel 
saying: ``. . . You cannot claim to hold progressive values yet back 
Israel's apartheid government'';

  Whereas, instead of denouncing the horrors of Hamas slaughtering 
Israelis, Rashida Tlaib stated on October 8, 2023, ``The path to the 
future must include lifting the blockade, ending the occupation, and 
dismantling the apartheid system that creates the suffocating 
dehumanizing conditions that can lead to resistance'';
  Whereas, Rashida Tlaib exhibited her hatred for America by reposting 
a message on October 12, 2023, blaming America for allowing the deaths 
of Palestinian babies at the hands of Israel;
  Whereas, Rashida Tlaib incited an illegal occupation at the United 
States Capitol complex on October 18, 2023, which put Members of 
Congress, their staffs, and Capitol visitors in danger by shutting down 
elevators, stairwells, and points of egress, while obstructing official 
business in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, including 
a Senate Foreign Affairs Committee hearing;
  Whereas, the illegal occupation incited by Rashida Tlaib was 
organized by Jewish Voice for Peace, which the Anti-Defamation League 
calls ``a radical anti-Israel activist group that advocates for a 
complete economic, cultural, and academic boycott of the State of 
Israel,'' and that believes ``Israeli policies and actions are 
motivated by deeply rooted Jewish racial chauvinism and religious 
supremacism'';
  Whereas, several illegal occupiers at the Capitol belong to a group 
messaging chat called Global Intifada, which is the Arabic word for 
rebellion or uprising and refers to a series of protests and violent 
riots carried out by Palestinians in Israel during the last century;
  Whereas, by inciting an illegal occupation of the Capitol complex on 
October 18, 2023, Rashida Tlaib followed Hezbollah's orders to carry 
out a day of unprecedented anger following an explosion at a Gazan 
hospital, lying about Israel's responsibility for the attack, which 
United States intelligence agencies said was not perpetuated by Israel;
  Whereas, over 300 arrests were made following the illegal occupation 
of the Capitol complex on October 18, 2023, for violations of District 
of Columbia law, such as crowding, obstructing, or incommoding, and for 
assaulting police officers; and
  Whereas, Members of Congress who denounce the United States while 
praising terrorist organizations are unfit to hold office. Now, 
therefore, be it resolved that Representative Rashida Tlaib be 
censured; Representative Rashida Tlaib forthwith present herself in the 
well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure; 
and Representative Rashida Tlaib be censured with the public reading of 
this resolution by the Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under rule IX, a resolution offered from the 
floor by a Member other than the majority leader or the minority leader 
as a question of the privileges of the House has immediate precedence 
only at a time designated by the Chair within 2 legislative days after 
the resolution is properly noticed.
  Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the 
gentlewoman from Georgia will appear in the Record at this point.
  The Chair will not at this point determine whether the resolution

Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of 
the House and offer the resolution that was previously noticed.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.
  The Clerk read as follows:

                              H. Res. 845

       Whereas Israel has existed on its lands for millennia and 
     the United States played a critical role in returning Israel 
     to those lands in 1948 immediately following the Holocaust in 
     recognition of its right to exist and as an indelible signal 
     of our solidarity with the Jewish people;
       Whereas Israel is a critical ally to the American people 
     and to our strategic national security interests in the 
     Middle East;
       Whereas the people of Israel--including American citizens--
     were brutally attacked on October 7, 2023, by Hamas;
       Whereas Representative Rashida Tlaib, within 24 hours of 
     the October 7 barbaric attack on Jewish citizens of the State 
     of Israel, representing the deadliest day for Jews since the 
     Holocaust, defended the brutal rapes, murders, be-headings, 
     and kidnapping--including of Americans--by Hamas as justified 
     ``resistance'' to the ``apartheid state'';
       Whereas Representative Tlaib's October 8 statement claimed 
     that Hamas' October 7 attack on the Jewish people was partly 
     attributable to United States security aid provided to 
     Israel, which ignores the fact that the Iron Dome, a co-
     developed air defense system, saved lives that day by 
     intercepting rockets launched from the Gaza Strip against 
     Israeli civilian targets;
       Whereas, on October 18, 2023, Representative Tlaib 
     continued to knowingly spread the false narrative that Israel 
     intentionally bombed the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital on October 17 
     after United States intelligence, Israeli intelligence, and 
     President Biden assessed with high confidence that Israel did 
     not cause the explosion;
       Whereas, on November 3, 2023, Representative Tlaib 
     published on social media a video containing the phrase 
     ``from the river to the sea'', which is widely recognized as 
     a genocidal call to violence to destroy the state of Israel 
     and its people to replace it with a Palestinian state 
     extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea;
       Whereas Representative Tlaib doubled down on this call to 
     violence by falsely describing ``from the river to the sea'' 
     as ``an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and 
     peaceful coexistence'' despite it clearly entailing Israel's 
     destruction and denial of its fundamental right to exist; and
       Whereas Representative Tlaib has repeatedly displayed 
     conduct entirely unbecoming of a Member of the House of 
     Representatives by calling for the destruction of the state 
     of Israel and dangerously promoting false narratives 
     regarding a brutal, large-scale terrorist attack against 
     civilian targets inside the sovereign territory of a major 
     non-NATO ally while hundreds of Israeli and American hostages 
     remain in terrorist captivity: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That Representative Rashida Tlaib be censured.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution qualifies.

                              {time}  1430


                            Motion to Table

  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion.
  The Clerk read as follows:

       Ms. Clark of Massachusetts moves to lay the resolution on 
     the table.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to table.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it.
  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5-minute vote.
  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 208, 
nays 213, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 11, as follows:;  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. DesJarlais). Pursuant to clause 2 of 
rule IX, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. McCormick) and the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, Representative Tlaib has repeatedly made 
atrocious statements against our ally Israel and in support of Hamas, a 
terrorist group responsible for the largest massacre of Jews since the 
Holocaust.
  Represent Tlaib has levied unbelievable falsehoods about our greatest 
ally, Israel, and the attack on October 7. Recently, she even falsely 
blamed them for bombing the Al Ahli Arab hospital, but all of our 
current intelligence shows that Israel was not responsible.
  As stated in my resolution on November 3, Representative Tlaib said: 
``From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human 
rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate. My 
work and advocacy is always centered in justice and dignity for all 
people no matter faith or ethnicity.''
  Mr. Speaker, let me break down the saying, ``From the river to the 
sea.'' The river is the Jordan River, and the sea is the Mediterranean 
Sea. This is a call for the complete destruction of Israel. It is 
disgusting when it is used in this context that was meant.
  Representative Tlaib boycotted Israeli President Herzog's address to 
Congress, releasing a joint statement with Representative Bush that 
said: ``Bestowing President Herzog with the rare honor of a joint 
address to Congress while the Israeli apartheid government continues to 
enable and directly support racism and brutal settler attacks is a slap 
in the face to victims, survivors, and their loved ones. . . .''
  This kind of hatred against our ally Israel is unacceptable. Israel 
has a right to exist. For thousands of years, the Jewish people resided 
in that land and, after being displaced for centuries, returned in 1948 
after the Holocaust.
  Mr. Speaker, we have seen the effects of the reprehensible rhetoric 
of Representative Tlaib across the Nation. At schools and colleges 
around the country, Jewish students have been forced to be on alert as 
their anti-Semitic peers have engaged in disgusting demonstrations, 
chanting anti-Semitic slogans.
  At The Cooper Union, a private college in New York, Jewish students 
were forced to hide from pro-Hamas protesters in a library where they 
feared for their safety.
  At George Washington University, just about a half mile from this 
building, students broadcast ``Glory to our martyrs,'' and ``Free 
Palestine from the river to the sea,'' on the side of a campus 
building.
  Further, yesterday, in Ventura County, California, Paul Kessler, a 
Jewish man protesting for Israel, was killed in an altercation with 
pro-Palestinian protesters.
  These anti-Semitic incidents are happening right now in America in 
2023. Quite frankly, in my entire lifetime, I have never seen anything 
like it.
  The same Nation that defeated Nazism in World War II must now defeat 
an internal rot promoting the same senseless violence and hatred of 
Jewish people.
  It is a sad fact, but this type of anti-Semitic hate is being 
promoted by a small group of Members in this body--chiefly, 
Representative Tlaib. We must hold her accountable.
  This war in Israel is affecting everyone, whether it is innocent 
Palestinians at risk because of Hamas' actions; or our fellow Jewish 
Americans, who now have to worry each day about the possibility of an 
anti-Semitic attack; or Sergeant Elisheva Rose Ida Lubin, a young 
Jewish woman who was a member of the Israeli Border Police and grew up 
in Dunwoody, Georgia, and was killed by a Palestinian assailant.
  For the safety and security of our Nation, we must continue to 
support Israel, a nation fighting for democracy, decency, and Western 
values.
  Representative Tlaib has undermined U.S. interests with her 
statements and must be censured.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I have images of three politicians in my office: Abraham 
Lincoln, Robert F. Kennedy, and Samuel H. Bellman, who was the first 
Jewish person ever elected to the Minnesota Legislature, a great 
champion of civil rights and civil liberties in the Constitution and of 
the creation of the

[[Page H5496]]

State of Israel, the Jewish democratic state in 1948. He was my 
grandfather.
  He was elected at a time of terrible anti-Semitism, not unlike today. 
Minneapolis was actually called the anti-Semitism capital of America, 
and my grandpa told me a story I will never forget.
  The Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and Republican Caucuses both had 
their annual retreats at a country club that did not allow Jews or 
Blacks to enter. My grandfather complained privately to the speaker 
about the fact that he wouldn't be able to go to his own retreat. The 
speaker apologized but said that it was a tradition.
  So my grandfather, the only Jewish person in the chamber, spoke on 
the floor about anti-Semitism. He was booed and jeered at, and members 
left as he tried to speak.
  When the minority leader asked me to manage our time today, I thought 
about my grandfather and how he must have felt on that day. I rise here 
not in spite of the fact that I am a Jewish American who supports the 
Constitution and the Jewish democratic state and hates all the anti-
Semitic tyrants and terrorists of the world, from Putin in Russia and 
Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia to Hezbollah in Hamas. I am here 
because of these things and because of everything that I believe in and 
stand for.
  At this moment when democracy is under siege all over the world, 
America must stand tall for the Constitution of the United States. This 
resolution is about one thing and one thing only: the punishment of 
speech.
  We have the chance to show the world what the American Constitution 
means and how we hold fast to our core principles even when we are 
drawn away from them by our passions and our righteous anger.

  The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and the very heart 
of it is our First Amendment, which protects every citizen's freedom of 
speech and says Congress shall make no law abridging it.
  The freedom to speak includes the freedom to disagree, the right to 
think radically differently from the majority about important things, 
or else it is no freedom at all. It is easy to defend freedom of speech 
for people when you agree with them. The test for each Member today is 
whether you can defend freedom of speech for people when you most 
fundamentally and vehemently disagree with them.
  The First Amendment is like an apple, and everybody wants to take 
just one little bite out of it--leftwing speech, rightwing speech, 
sexist speech, feminist speech, homophobic speech, pro-LGBTQ speech, 
anti-war speech, pro-war speech, religious speech, sacrilegious speech. 
Everybody wants a bite out of the apple.
  At the end of the day, after everybody has taken his or her bite, do 
you know what is left? Nothing. There is nothing left.
  If you want to save the apple, you have to learn to tolerate not just 
the speech you love the most but the speech you hate the most.
  Now, like the First Amendment, the Speech or Debate Clause embodies 
this central value in the proceedings of this body. It states that 
Members of Congress ``shall in all cases, except treason, felony, and 
breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance 
at the session of their respective Houses, and in going to and 
returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either House, 
they shall not be questioned in any other place.''
  In the two-and-a-half-century history of this great Chamber, Members 
have been overwhelmingly censured for their actions, not for their 
speech--actions like participating in the violent assault against 
Charles Sumner of Massachusetts; assaulting Representative Grinnell, of 
Iowa, with a cane; selling military academy appointments; taking 
bribes; engaging in mail fraud and payroll fraud; improper spending of 
campaign funds; embezzling congressional money; engaging in sexual 
misconduct with a House page.
  Do you see the difference? It is not what they said. It is what they 
did.
  I can find only three categories of cases where speech is the sum and 
substance of the charge, and all are exceptions that have been ratified 
by the Supreme Court:
  One, violent threats against other Members of this body, which the 
Court has found, as recently as April, are not protected by the First 
Amendment.
  Two, fighting words: the use of unparliamentary or aggressively 
insulting language on the House floor that constitutes a direct affront 
to another Member. The Supreme Court has said that fighting words are 
not protected.
  Three, speech advocating or promoting treason, secession, or 
insurrection, all of them outside of the First Amendment because of 
numerous provisions in our Constitution condemning and opposing 
insurrection.
  That is it: violent threats against other Members, fighting words on 
the floor, speech inciting insurrection.
  The resolution offered against the gentlewoman from Michigan is all 
about censuring her for her political speech and literally nothing 
else. No actions, no conduct, is being alleged or punished. The entire 
motion is about her speech and how much we hate it and how wrong we 
think it is, and all of that is fine for all of us to express 
individually on the floor, in the media, on social media.
  I have said to Ms. Tlaib myself that the phrase ``from the river to 
sea'' is abhorrent to me, even with her published explanation of what 
she means by it, which is very different from what Hamas says about it 
and how Hamas uses it, but I would never think of punishing her or 
disciplining her because we disagree about that.
  The resolution proposes to condemn her for quoting this objectionable 
phrase in her video, a video which is indisputably protected speech 
under the First Amendment.
  Unlike the gentleman from New York, Mr. Santos, whose proposed 
expulsion by members of the majority was rejected by a commanding 
bipartisan majority last week because he has not been convicted of 
either the criminal or the ethics charges outstanding against him, Ms. 
Tlaib has been criminally charged with nothing. She has been civilly 
sued for nothing. She has no ethics charges outstanding before the 
Ethics Committee in any way.
  It is easy to see why. She cannot face criminal punishment or civil 
liability for her speech because, in the United States of America, we 
don't punish people for their political ideas, no matter how 
wrongheaded or offensive we think they are. The majority might think 
they are, or it might not, but in any event, it doesn't make any 
difference.
  She won reelection with 71 percent of the vote in Michigan's 12th 
District, and if anyone is going to punish her for her political ideas 
or performance, it must be the people of her own district who sent her 
here to represent them.
  Mr. Speaker, the disciplinary process should never be used to punish 
the political speech or viewpoints of a Member of this Chamber just 
because the majority disagrees.
  The punishment of political viewpoints will mean that Members will be 
censured just for being in the minority rather than in the majority, 
and that will come to stifle our dialogue and haunt all of our work.
  For example, the good Speaker of the House, who is my friend from the 
Judiciary Committee, has taken positions in the past arguing that sex 
between consenting gay adults should be a crime, that the Supreme Court 
was wrong to strike down sodomy laws in Lawrence v. Texas and wrong to 
give gay people the right to marry in Obergefell, a right that he said 
is ``the dark harbinger of chaos and sexual anarchy that could doom 
even the strongest republic.''

  The vast majority of Americans reject these positions as extreme in 
public opinion polls and believe all citizens should have the freedom 
to pursue their own love lives and to marry.
  If the House majority changes hands, should we actually censure the 
former Speaker of the House for his constitutional apostasy and thought 
crimes against the rights of millions of Americans? I sure hope not 
because the gentleman from Louisiana is absolutely entitled to his 
political and religious views, no matter how far outside the 
constitutional and American mainstream they are.
  Under the First Amendment, extremism is in the eye of the beholder, 
but how will we resist the temptation to punish him in the future if we 
set a precedent today that Members can be censured and canceled simply 
for their

[[Page H5497]]

political heresies in the eyes of the majority controlling the House?
  If we say the gentlewoman can be punished because her views of 
history are wrong, as I heard my friend say, can we then punish Members 
of this body who refuse to vote to take down in our Halls the statues 
of Members of Congress from the 19th century who joined the Confederacy 
and committed treason against the Union, people like John Breckinridge, 
a former Vice President and U.S. Senator who was expelled from the 
Senate after he defected to the Confederacy? Should we use the 
disciplinary process to impose historical orthodoxy?
  If anything, there is a stronger constitutional case for punishing 
the 120 Members of the House who voted against taking down statues of 
Confederate traitors because multiple provisions of the Constitution 
explicitly forbid and punish participation in insurrection. Do Members 
who voted that way want to risk being censured in the future by 
establishing that divergent minority views on history are a legitimate 
matter of institutional discipline?
  What about the Members who defended conspiracy theorist Alex Jones 
and stated that Sandy Hook and Parkland mass murderers of dozens of 
schoolchildren were staged by Hollywood to generate support for gun 
safety? That is not even a matter of opinion but adjudicated positive 
fact, and still, the Constitution protects your right to be wrong about 
facts unless you are deliberately defrauding or cheating someone out of 
something like money or campaign contributions.

                              {time}  1500

  What about all of those Members who have followed the former 
President in advancing the big lie that he actually won the 2020 
election? Should we convert the 60 Federal and State court decisions 
rejecting claims of election fraud and corruption into discipline and 
punishment of Members who still cling to that view?
  What about the 11 Members of this body who lost the 405-11 vote in 
2019 recognizing that the mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks 
during World War I was a genocide? Does their denial of the genocidal 
character of the deaths of more than 1 million Armenians qualify them 
for collective punishment today, institutional punishment?
  Can we convert differing interpretations of history into the basis 
for disciplinary action?
  Well, perhaps you say political dissent should be uniquely punishable 
when it comes to foreign policy. Of course, the First Amendment doesn't 
distinguish between speech having domestic or foreign policy content. 
All of it is protected. If not, every Member of this body who has voted 
against aid to Ukraine and praises Vladimir Putin, as the former 
President did for his ``genius'' and his ``savvy,'' or says Putin is 
not our enemy, as a number of Members have, could be censured for it by 
this body.
  This resolution not only degrades our Constitution but cheapens the 
meaning of discipline in this body for people who actually commit 
wrongful actions like bribery, fraud, violent assault, and so on.
  When people are punished for their political ideas and expression, 
they will wear it as a badge of honor. They will fundraise on it. 
Millions of dollars will flow to people who are punished that way, and 
they will join the public in mocking the new speech censors of 
Congress.
  A secure constitutional republic, which actively protects the freedom 
of dissenting speech to allow for serious debate and growth as society, 
shows its strength, not its weakness.
  As Thomas Jefferson, whose beautiful statue is right outside of this 
room, put it: ``If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve 
this Union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed 
as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be 
tolerated, where reason is left free to combat it.''
  Now is a moment when we will get to see who in the House of 
Representatives believes in the freedom of speech, even the speech they 
hate, versus those who want to impose a new political straitjacket of 
cancel culture on America and Congress.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Fine speech. You talk about setting precedents. I think there is a 
precedent. You guys must have searched really high and far and long to 
find the people who voted against censuring Paul Gosar or Marjorie 
Taylor Greene. There is a precedent. You are right.
  When you talk about freedom of speech and who protects that freedom 
of speech, you are talking to a marine, and you are about to talk to a 
Navy SEAL, people who would give their lives to defend the freedom of 
speech. I understand that probably as well as anybody.
  Let me be clear. This is not about a First Amendment issue. Rashida 
Tlaib has the right to spew anti-Semitic vitriol and even call for the 
destruction of the Jewish state, but the House of Representatives also 
has the right to make it clear that her hate speech does not reflect 
the opinion of the Chamber. That is what this resolution is about.
  When you talk about ``from the river to the sea,'' we talked about 
this with the Parliamentarian, and we talked about it with legal 
counsel. We talked about precedent. We got the Intel Committee to make 
sure the facts are straight. We did our homework on whether there is a 
precedent on this.
  If this is not worthy of censure, what is? When you can call for the 
annihilation of a country and its people, if that is not worthy of 
censure, what is?
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
Van Orden).
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.
  Mr. VAN ORDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague 
from Georgia's privileged resolution to censure the Congresswoman from 
Minnesota.
  Before I do so, I remind my dear friend from Maryland that the 
Founding Fathers did not envision Twitter, but the Nuremberg War Crimes 
Tribunal decided that genocide, in fact, is a felony.
  One month ago today, October 7, 2023, savages from the terrorist 
organization, Hamas, invaded Israel from the Gaza Strip and 
intentionally targeted Jewish civilians, men, women, children, and 
infants, and then slaughtered them.
  Jews were being killed at a level not seen since the Holocaust, and 
worldwide anti-Semitism is at an all-time high. We have seen anti-
Semitic and pro-terrorist rallies at major universities across America. 
This last weekend, here in our Nation's Capital, we saw over 200,000 
people rallying in support of the terrorist organization, Hamas, that 
committed these atrocities in Israel. They defaced our national 
monuments and the White House.
  Most disturbingly, in this House, the House that freed men from the 
scourge that is slavery and gave women suffrage, we have a Member who 
not only supports this organization, Hamas, that slaughtered these Jews 
but has actively called for the eradication of the Jews as a people by 
promoting the slogan ``from the river to the sea'' on social media. She 
represents this as an aspirational phrase, and she is correct. It is 
aspirational for those who call for the destruction of the Jewish 
people.
  When I retired from the SEAL teams in 2014, I vowed that I would 
defend the Jewish people if any horrors like those that took place on 
October 7, 2023, were to occur. Following the murder of the innocents 
that took place on October 7, I fulfilled that promise by visiting 
Israel.
  I visited with war-wounded soldiers in medical facilities and 
consulted with military and various governmental officials. I grieved 
with the families who had lost their loved ones to this savagery. I 
visited the kibbutzim where infants were butchered by beasts, including 
one who was removed from its pregnant mother's stomach as she watched 
in horror before she herself was executed.

  I bore witness to these horrors that can barely be described so that 
no one can ever tell me that these events did not take place. Hamas is 
responsible for them and is enabled by those who parrot their slogans.
  Another massacre site I visited was the Supernova music festival, 
where

[[Page H5498]]

over 200 children were butchered. Their lives were ruthlessly 
extinguished after many were raped, tortured, dismembered, and then 
burnt.
  As I was walking through the field strewn with the detritus of this 
war crime, I noticed some cups, simple festival cups. I asked the 
Israeli minister I was with if I could take some home to the United 
States so that I would have a tangible object that could represent the 
lives of those beautiful children from around the world who were 
killed. I brought back enough of these cups to give to many of my 
colleagues, including the one I stand here today to censure.
  She and many other Members of this House need to understand that 
these are human beings. They were not slogans or a flag or a chant. 
They were children who will never be able to dance again, never be able 
to love again. Most tragically, they will never be able to look into 
the eyes of their own children they will never be able to bear.
  I ask you today, Mr. Speaker, if you had the chance to stop the 
Holocaust, would you?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin.
  Mr. VAN ORDEN. Mr. Speaker, I call upon my fellow colleagues from 
both parties to say yes, we would stop the Holocaust. We will not stay 
silent as the 21st century holocaust unfolds before our very eyes. We 
will not.
  I cast my vote today to censure, to affirm our commitment to justice 
and in the defense of the Israeli people.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).
  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I am the only Palestinian American serving in 
Congress. My perspective is needed here now more than ever.
  I will not be silenced, and I will not let you distort my words. 
Folks forget I am from the city of Detroit, the most beautiful, 
Blackest city in the country, where I learned to speak truth to power, 
even if my voice shakes. Trying to bully or censure me won't work 
because this movement for a cease-fire is much bigger than one person. 
It is growing every single day.
  There are millions of people across our country who oppose 
Netanyahu's extremism and are done watching our government support 
collective punishment and the use of white phosphorus bombs that melt 
flesh to the bone.
  They are done watching our government, Mr. Speaker, supporting 
cutting off food, water, electricity, and medical care to millions of 
people with nowhere to go.
  Like me, Mr. Speaker, they don't believe the answer to war crimes is 
more war crimes.
  The refusal of Congress and the administration to acknowledge 
Palestinian lives is chipping away at my soul. Over 10,000 Palestinians 
have been killed. The majority were children.
  Let me be clear: My criticism has always been of the Israeli 
Government and Netanyahu's actions.
  It is important to separate people and governments, Mr. Speaker. No 
government is beyond criticism. The idea that criticizing the 
Government of Israel is anti-Semitic sets a very dangerous precedent, 
and it is being used to silence diverse voices speaking up for human 
rights across our Nation.
  Do you realize what it is like, Mr. Speaker, for the people outside 
of the Chamber right now listening in agony to their own government 
dehumanizing them, to hear the President of the United States we helped 
elect dispute death tolls as we see video after video of parents and 
dead children under rubble?
  Mr. Speaker, do you know what it is like to feel rising hate crimes, 
to know how Islamophobia and anti-Semitism make us all less safe, and 
to worry that your own child might suffer the horrors that 6-year-old 
Wadea did in Illinois?
  I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not 
disposable. We are human beings just like anyone else. My sity, my 
grandmother, like all Palestinians, just wants to live her life with 
the freedom and human dignity we all deserve.
  Speaking up to save lives, Mr. Speaker, no matter faith, no matter 
ethnicity, should not be controversial in this Chamber. The cries of 
Palestinian and Israeli children sound no different to me. What I do 
not understand is why the cries of Palestinians sound different to you-
all.

  We cannot lose our shared humanity, Mr. Speaker. I hear the voices of 
advocates in Israel, in Palestine, across America, and around the world 
for peace. I am inspired by the courageous survivors in Israel who have 
lost loved ones yet are calling for a cease-fire and the end to 
violence. I am grateful to the people in the streets for the peace 
movement, with countless Jewish Americans across the country standing 
up and lovingly saying: ``Not in our name.''
  We will continue to call for a cease-fire, Mr. Speaker, for the 
immediate delivery of critical humanitarian aid to Gaza, for the 
release of all hostages and those arbitrarily detained, and for every 
American to come home. We will continue to work for real, lasting peace 
that upholds human rights and the dignity of all people and centers 
peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians, censures no 
one, and ensures that no person, no child, has to suffer or live in 
fear of violence.
  Seventy-one percent of Michigan Democrats support a cease-fire. You 
can try to censure me, but you can't silence their voices.
  I urge my colleagues to join with the majority of Americans and 
support a cease-fire now to save as many lives as possible. President 
Biden must listen to and represent all of us, not just some of us.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the President to have the courage to call for a 
cease-fire and the end of killings.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  If this was about calling for a cease-fire, we would not have these 
proceedings.
  I was wrong, by the way, when I said that it must have taken a long 
time to find somebody who hasn't voted for censorship from the other 
side of the aisle. You didn't find it. The gentleman from the other 
side of the aisle actually did vote for censorship on a First Amendment 
right. I find it rather funny. We just researched it. Unless my sources 
are wrong, the vast majority of the other side of the aisle actually 
voted for censorship based on a First Amendment right.
  I also wanted to say that my heart goes out to the Palestinian 
people--it truly does--especially those people who were bombed in the 
hospital, which my colleague knows wasn't from the Israelis.

                              {time}  1515

  Yet the statement is contrary to that, even though our intel was very 
clear, as was our President, very clear. That is what this debate is 
about.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for the 
time.
  With respect to the gentleman from Maryland, I understand the 
perspective with respect to free speech, and I certainly wish to always 
stand aside the protection of free speech in this country, but this 
goes well beyond that.
  We are not talking about restraining the gentlewoman from Michigan's 
ability to speak as an American citizen. We are not talking about 
punishing her and putting her in jail.
  What we are talking about is whether a Member of the House of 
Representatives, a Member of this body representing this Nation, is 
justified in putting forward a defense of the actions of Hamas 
terrorists that murdered innocent Israeli citizens and are holding 
United States citizens and Israelis hostage. In her own language, she 
was defending on October 8--a mere 24 hours into the brutal and 
barbaric attacks in which babies were beheaded, babies were placed into 
ovens, literally. Moms were raped in a house while their babies were 
put in an oven. This is a documented account, video evidence, and this 
is dismissed as resistance to an apartheid state.
  My problem is that the gentlewoman is also referring to Joe Biden 
supporting the genocide of the Palestinian people. The gentlewoman has 
put forward that by virtue of the United States of America funding, in 
solidarity the people of Israel in defense of their right to exist, 
that by virtue of our position as Americans standing in

[[Page H5499]]

front of that flag in this Chamber representing 330 million Americans, 
that by funding and supporting Israel, we are somehow perpetuating the 
call for violence that we saw unfold right before our eyes on October 7 
in the most brutal and heinous acts that some of us have ever seen.
  I do not doubt the gentlewoman's sincerity of her concern for her 
home people and concerns about the attacks on the people of Gaza.
  I had some people who called into question that I would put out my 
public support for my former colleague, Justin Amash, who lost cousins 
in a church, receiving missile fire into a building next to a church.
  I genuinely pray for the people of Israel, the people of Gaza, the 
people throughout the world that are now dealing with all of this.
  The gentlewoman cannot, as a Member of Congress, be standing up and 
telling the world that what we saw unfold in attacking Israel is 
justified. We can't.
  Free speech matters. I have grave concern right now about where this 
institution is going with respect to censures. I voted against the 
censure last week because I thought it had drafting problems and I 
thought it had significant concerns it raised.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe the work that was done by my friend from 
Georgia, he put forward a resolution that is worthy of support. I 
support the resolution and believe that we should pass it.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).
  Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this censure 
resolution that is blatantly Islamophobic, anti-democratic, and an 
utter waste of time.
  This resolution is as dishonest as it is unproductive. Any Member who 
denies that Congresswoman Tlaib has opposed the killing of civilians--
Israeli, Palestinian, and American alike--is willfully ignoring the 
truth.
  Representative Tlaib was elected by voters in Michigan to do exactly 
what she does best: advocate for a better, safer, more just world. She 
leads with love, speaks truth to power, and seeks justice even when her 
life and that of her family and her staff are threatened.
  As a daughter, mother, sister, friend, advocate, and effective, duly-
elected, three-term, first-ever Palestinian-American Member of 
Congress, she has been a much-needed voice in an institution that has 
too often failed to listen.
  Today, Republicans are again attacking a Democratic colleague just 
because they don't like what she has to say. It is another shameful but 
predictable ploy of distraction from the real traffickers of hate who 
are obsessed with policing progressive women of color.
  Mr. Speaker, I oppose this offensive resolution for every little girl 
from Michigan to the Middle East who sees herself when they see the 
leadership of Representative Rashida Tlaib, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), a Marine Corps general.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of Proverbs 18:21, which 
says: ``Words kill, words give life; they're either poison or fruit--
you choose.''
  I take no joy in standing here today to censure a fellow Michigan 
Representative, but Congresswoman Tlaib's words and actions are 
abhorrent and beneath her office.
  Representative Tlaib has tripled-down on her anti-Semitic and anti-
Israel rhetoric, recently posting a video with protesters chanting, 
``from the river to the sea,'' with a follow-up comment explaining that 
that phrase is a peaceful aphorism about human rights.
  However, that quote has long been a rallying cry for supporters of 
Hamas and other terrorists hell-bent on destroying Israel. ``From the 
river to the sea'' refers to the area, of course, between the Jordan 
River and the Mediterranean Sea, which is the State of Israel.
  Jewish Americans are being targeted in their schools and on our 
Nation's streets. Just yesterday, a California man supporting Israel 
was murdered during competing pro-Israel, pro-Palestinian rallies.
  Words matter and words have real-world implications. Congresswoman 
Tlaib's continued assault on the only Jewish state in the world, 
Israel, is reprehensible and this body should come together to support 
this censure resolution to say to Representative Tlaib: Enough.

  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).
  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution.
  Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib is an important member of our Democratic 
Caucus and our Michigan delegation. Her voice matters. She is the only 
Palestinian American in Congress, and this is a representative body. 
Her perspective reflects many that she represents, especially when it 
is not twisted.
  Congresswoman Tlaib is entitled to the same constitutionally 
protected freedom of speech and expression that every other American 
and every other Member of this body has. This resolution is an attack 
on that fundamental right.
  I spent all weekend in Michigan this last weekend talking to all the 
communities about the meaning of this phrase. There are very strong 
feelings on all sides. It is very clear that people interpret words in 
different ways. Personally, I choose not to use a phrase that is 
offensive to some and that many perceive as a threat, but I also take 
seriously living in a country that does not restrict, forbid, or 
censure free speech.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew).
  Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, soulless, disgusting, sickening, 
reprehensible, and repulsive--these are not my words but the words of 
my Democratic colleagues when asked about the decision of 15 Members 
who refused to condemn Hamas' brutal terror attacks on innocent 
Israelis.
  Some of those 15 didn't stop there. Several of these Members have 
gone on to use their massive platforms to accuse Israel of apartheid, 
genocide, and war crimes. This rhetoric by Members of Congress is not 
only careless, it is dangerous.
  American cities and the cities around the world have been flooded 
with anti-Israeli protests. Protestors scream for an intifada. They 
demand a cleansing of Jews from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean 
Sea, the destruction of Israel, and the destruction of the United 
States of America.
  They ripped down the pictures of Jewish children and Jewish babies 
being held hostage in Gaza. It is reprehensible. It is unacceptable.
  Hamas is a terrorist organization that does not care about the 
Palestinian people. Their goal is to wipe Israel from the face of the 
Earth. Babies were burned alive. Babies were beheaded. Women were 
raped, beaten, displayed, and then murdered. Children, mothers, 
grandmothers, fathers, grandfathers, they were all killed.
  Anyone who supports this or refuses to condemn it has no place in the 
United States Congress. I don't like censure--I hate censure--but we 
have to draw a line in the sand somewhere. We do not entertain hate in 
this Congress. We confront it, and we must do it with absolute 
conviction.
  This is not a freedom of speech issue. This is an issue of the 
Congress of the United States having the right to say this is wrong.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the ranking member of the 
Rules Committee.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we should reject this resolution for a few 
simple reasons: first is protecting this institution. I don't agree 
with a lot of what people say around here. I think a lot of what my 
Republican friends say is offensive and even racist, but I don't go 
around introducing censure resolutions.
  If we are going to start censuring anybody who says something we 
don't like, all we will do from now on is censure each other all day.
  The second reason is freedom of speech. My Republican colleagues go 
on and on about cancel culture, and here they are today trying to 
cancel someone.
  I don't want any lectures from people who are trying to create a 
1984-style

[[Page H5500]]

thought police. I don't know what is wrong with them, Mr. Speaker. If 
this is not the high point of Republican hypocrisy, I don't know what 
is.
  Mr. Speaker, I say to my Republican colleagues that they are 
unleashing something very bad here. They are setting an awful precedent 
for this institution. This is a very slippery slope.
  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution to protect this 
institution, to protect freedom of speech, and to reject this 
majority's cynical attempts to divide and distract America.
  Mr. Speaker, I would say that if my Republican friends don't like 
listening to people they disagree with, they should get a new job.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. Miller), a marine.
  Mr. MILLER of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today at what I think is a 
very serious moment for our country and for the world.
  Hate and anti-Semitism are on the rise. Our strongest ally and great 
friend, Israel, is under siege at the hands of brutal terrorists. As a 
member of the United States Marines, I know when a Member of the House 
of Representatives is echoing a line that is a clear call to murder 
Jews and push Israel off the map--``from the river to the sea.''
  To be clear, ``from the river to the sea,'' as someone who is Jewish, 
means to exterminate my people. Never again.
  Mr. Speaker, the ADL recently reported that anti-Semitic incidents 
rose by roughly 400 percent in the 2 weeks following Hamas' evil attack 
on Israel, which began 1 month ago today.
  There is no question that these incidents are a direct result of the 
hate-filled lies and anti-Semitic rhetoric perpetuated by Members of 
this body--``from the river to the sea.''
  What exactly does that mean, ``from the river to the sea Palestine 
will be free.'' I am happy to educate all of you. It means the 
extermination of the Jewish people.
  I understand that my colleague, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. 
Tlaib), thinks that this is some kind of aspirational message. It is a 
joke.
  Mr. Speaker, I do think that this is an aspirational message. But it 
is not an aspiration of peaceful coexistence. It is an aspiration to 
the erasure of the State of Israel and its people, the Jewish people 
who call it home and who have been refugees since the very beginning of 
time.

                              {time}  1530

  It is an aspiration to the genocide of Jews.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe strongly that Members of this body should be 
able to speak their minds freely, but I also think there should be 
consequences for those who would use their platforms to perpetuate 
garbage that puts any American at risk especially because of their 
religion.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe that actions have consequences, and I believe 
that after a long string of anti-Semitic remarks and hate-filled 
rhetoric, censure is an appropriate consequence for the gentlewoman 
from Michigan.
  Never again, damn it, means never again.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the 
Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).
  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I come before you today in support of my 
colleague Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.
  All Members of Congress are entitled to freedom of speech. We also 
recognize that words matter and that they have the power to uplift or 
to harm others.
  While I have joined the statement rejecting certain harmful 
phraseology that has been used, I believe Congresswoman Tlaib's 
statement that she did not intend to wish harm to the Jewish community 
by her words.
  Congresswoman Tlaib has all since clarified that she was intending to 
make an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful 
coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.
  The ability to have free speech but to be willing to discuss and to 
change and clarify is not just mature but democratic. No Member should 
express harm to others, and Congresswoman Tlaib has been willing to 
listen, clarify, and express compassion.
  Yet on the other side of the aisle, we have seen repeatedly 
Republican Members make disparaging comments that have threatened our 
fellow colleagues and their families.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands.
  Ms. PLASKETT. We have had members of the Republican Conference make 
floor speeches about the great replacement theory that is suggestive of 
white nationalism.
  As a Black woman, I am offended.
  Will you censure the co-chair of your Conference, Mr. Speaker?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman's time has expired.
  Ms. PLASKETT. We need to uplift. We need to allow free speech.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands is 
no longer recognized.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
Congressman Rich McCormick's resolution of censure.
  Enemies of civilization are gruesomely bold and clear on their 
murderous intentions. A heinously revealing declaration of their 
barbaric intentions by the Iranian puppet Hamas is detailed in the 
Hamas Covenant of August 18, 1988. In the midst of insane provisions is 
article 7: ``The Day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims 
fight the Jews and kill them. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and 
trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: `O Muslim, there is a Jew 
hiding behind me, come and kill him.'''
  They are very clear. What they are talking about is death to Israel 
and then death to America.
  The New York Post is correct in warning last week that we in America 
are subject to another 9/11 attack being imminent by such people.
  The goal of Hamas puppets of Iran is to murder the Jews worldwide. It 
is fake news about caring for the Palestinian people. This is not about 
territory. Suffering by the Hamas-oppressed people of Gaza is solely 
Hamas dictated.
  We know the duplicitous wording of ``from the river to the sea'' is 
nothing more than a call of mass murder to Jewish people and will then 
lead to mass murder in America.
  Hamas, Houthis, and also Hezbollah are puppets of Iran with their 
intent, and we are actually in a war we did not choose between 
dictators with rule of gun attacking democracies with rule of law. This 
began with the war criminal Putin's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 
2022, and led to the Hamas invasion of Israel on Putin's birthday, 
October 7.
  Over 30 missile attacks have already seriously injured American 
troops who are serving in this war.
  Bold and clear are the dictators with Putin's treatise of July 2021 
that Ukraine does not exist; that the Chinese Communist Party that 
threatens the 24 million people of Taiwan, they don't exist; and Iran 
chants in English, ``death to Israel, death to America.''
  It is sad to hear how the Iranian propaganda is being promoted by our 
media and colleges.
  As the grateful father of four sons who have served in Iraq, Egypt, 
and Afghanistan, I appreciate the Israeli and Ukrainian troops for 
their courage.
  Democracies will prevail by building peace through strength.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. Jayapal).
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this 
resolution.
  Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib is one of only two Muslim-American women 
elected to this body, and the only Palestinian-American in Congress. 
She has fought tirelessly and successfully to get clean drinking water 
for her constituents and to ensure that people have housing and 
environmental justice.
  If we truly want Congress to be a diverse body that represents the 
diversity of views across this country, then we have to be willing to 
stand up for those diverse views to be expressed. We don't have to 
agree with them, but we do have to protect the right to the freedom of 
speech which this body is absolutely required to do.

[[Page H5501]]

  Our country and our world are in crisis. People are suffering 
everywhere. Historic and present traumas for Jews, Muslims, Arabs, 
South Asians, Sikhs, and so many others are playing themselves out, and 
we as the elected Representatives of the people should be working 
together to protect the rights of every American to say what they 
believe and ensure that we preserve our democracy.
  Vote ``no'' on this terrible resolution.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. Lawler).
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, in 1893, Katharine Lee Bates wrote ``America 
the Beautiful.'' In it she wrote: ``God shed His grace on thee and 
crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea.''
  As the Bible says in Psalm 72:8: He shall have dominion from sea to 
sea and from the river unto the ends of the Earth.
  That is aspirational.
  Chanting ``from the river to the sea'' is not. Chanting ``from the 
river to the sea'' is calling for the eradication of Israel. I would 
hardly define that as aspirational.
  My colleague Representative Rashida Tlaib has parroted the talking 
points and the message of Hamas, a terrorist organization whose sworn 
mission is the destruction of Israel and the eradication of the Jewish 
people.
  Israel is our strongest ally in the Middle East, a beacon of hope, 
peace, and liberty in the region. It is the only multicultural, 
multiethnic, and multireligious democracy. It is not an apartheid 
state. The oppressor of the Palestinian people is Hamas and the 
Palestinian Authority.
  Mr. Speaker, if you want Palestinians to be free, then reject Hamas, 
reject the Palestinian Authority, and demand that Hamas surrender.
  Calling for a cease-fire that they won't abide to is outrageous. They 
need to immediately surrender and return the hostages to their 
families.
  My colleague repeated a vile and disgusting lie that Israel bombed a 
hospital knowing full well that was factually inaccurate and knowing 
full well that this administration, the Biden administration, advised 
her it was inaccurate, gave her a private briefing, and still she 
continued to repeat this vile and disgusting lie.
  Why?
  It was intended to undermine. It was intended to turn the world 
against Israel.
  Why?
  It is because when she chants ``from the river to the sea,'' she 
believes it. Mr. Speaker, she believes Israel should be eradicated 
because otherwise you would never, ever repeat that vile, vile 
statement.
  It is not a lie.
  That is why we are here. It is not a lie, and that is why we are 
here.
  Paul Kessler was killed for holding an Israeli flag in the United 
States of America. We are losing respect for the sanctity of life, the 
rule of law, and the important role of faith.
  We must combat anti-Semitism, and it starts with this censure.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Ms. Bush).
  Ms. BUSH. St. Louis and I rise today in opposition to this censure 
resolution and also in opposition to the reckless manner that people in 
this House speak when they don't realize or don't care that they put 
targets on the backs of actual people, most of whom are Black and 
Brown, because of a lack of care and the lack of understanding and a 
lack of seeing the humanity of folks who look like Rashida Tlaib.
  It is outrageous that my colleagues are blatantly, blatantly 
attempting to silence the only Palestinian-American Representative 
right here.
  It is outrageous, but it is not surprising. Let me tell you, Mr. 
Speaker, it is not surprising because this place is where 1,700 Members 
of Congress, this elected body, enslaved Black people. It is not 
surprising, because they thought it was right.
  It is not surprising because this is a place where Members continue 
to claim that the insurrection on the Capitol just appeared to look 
like a normal tourist visit.
  It is not surprising because this is the place where our Black and 
Brown staff members repeatedly speak of experiencing racism, sexism, 
Islamophobia, get pushed off of elevators, xenophobia and more right 
here in this workplace. This is the place.
  Let me say this: She mourns for the 1,400 Israelis who lost their 
lives.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman's time has expired.
  Ms. BUSH. She mourns for the 10,000, and she will not stop.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman's time has expired.
  Ms. BUSH. No more lies. Cease-fire now. She takes the death threats 
that you all send her, Mr. Speaker--The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
gentlewoman from Missouri is no longer recognized.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Fallon).
  Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I was sitting here not planning to speak at 
all, then I heard words from the other side of the aisle. They were 
flowery, they were eloquent, they had passion, they were articulate, 
they were powerful, and even moving probably to some.
  Nevertheless, were they true?
  I heard about protecting speech, the First Amendment, and our beloved 
Constitution.
  Who is not for protecting speech, our beloved Constitution, and the 
First Amendment?
  So does the gentleman from Maryland and our friends across the aisle 
really believe that?
  Then when I heard about slippery slope and setting a precedent, on 
February 4, 2021, Marjorie Taylor Greene was removed from her 
committees for things that she said before she was a Member of 
Congress.
  On November 17, 2021, Paul Gosar was censured for a cartoon that his 
staff posted. A tasteless cartoon though it be, it was speech.
  So we are protecting speech, are we?
  It is speech that we disagree with, calling the deliberate killing of 
innocent civilians resistance, claiming a bombing of a Gaza hospital 
was done by the Israelis that killed hundreds of people when we knew 
that was not true, and yet Ms. Tlaib doubled and tripled down on that. 
That was false, and that was a lie. And then repeating and celebrating 
a genocidal chant ``from the river to the sea.'' That is not a cartoon, 
and that is not saying some things, Mr. Speaker, that you said before 
you were a Member of Congress.
  Then we were accused of, oh, it is Islamophobic, or it was pointed 
out that she was a woman of color or she was the only Palestinian.
  What does any of that matter?
  This is about words and actions, and we hold everyone to the same 
standard. We are not trying to jail her. We are not trying to expel 
her. We are not levying a civil fine. We are not even talking about 
removing her from committees.
  We are simply firmly and formally disagreeing with her and chastising 
her for her words and her actions.
  What she did was not leadership. It was demagoguery of the worst 
kind, and it was beneath the dignity of this office, her office, and 
the alleged commitment to peace she claims.

                              {time}  1545

  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Bowman).
  Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution.
  First and foremost, can we please stop misrepresenting Representative 
Tlaib's words? She does not want to kill Jews. She is not in support of 
Hamas. She is speaking as someone who is the only Palestinian American 
in U.S. history to serve in this body.
  Without her voice, we would lack even more empathy for the people of 
Palestine. We would not have someone with direct personal experience 
speaking against the siege that is happening now in Gaza.
  This body needs empathy and compassion for all people, not just 
people who look like the majority of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle. Maybe because of your lack of diversity, you lack the 
cognitive and emotional ability to recognize diverse opinions when they 
speak truth to power. You absolutely need to open up your mind to other 
people and other experiences, especially when they are Muslim, when 
they are women, and when they are people of color.

[[Page H5502]]

  You had a Member of your party call my colleague a terrorist and 
didn't censure her, but we are having this conversation now about your 
interpretation of words.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia has 1\1/2\ 
minutes remaining. The gentleman from Maryland has 5 minutes remaining.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. Carson).
  Mr. CARSON. Mr. Speaker, this censure measure is a sham.
  When someone who is an American, a Muslim, a woman, and a Palestinian 
dares to speak out for her people, she is told to be quiet. She is told 
to stop talking about Palestinian brothers and sisters in the same 
breath as Jewish brothers and sisters.
  My sister Rashida is a child of the Midwest, representing the best of 
Midwestern sensibilities. She also exemplifies a rich tradition of the 
Islamic faith in the Midwest. She is a bold leader. She is a fair 
leader. She is a compassionate leader. Most importantly, she is an 
American.
  Standing up for one oppressed people does not negate the oppression 
of another.
  We should be working together to end this terrible suffering, 
eliminate these sham censures, and get back to the work of the people. 
That is why they elected us.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. Ramirez).
  Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Speaker, words hold power. They are intentional 
representations of our values and our beliefs. Our democracy is at its 
strongest when we protect the right to dissent, to resist, and to speak 
truth to power.
  However, over the past few weeks, this body has wrongfully and 
dangerously conflated dissent with hate speech and has willfully 
characterized acts of resistance as acts of bigotry. Bigotry and 
hateful speech are real, tangible threats to our shared humanity and 
our multiracial democracy, and we must address them.
  As someone who has heard Members of this body who are not being 
brought up for censure casually use their platforms to carelessly 
promote violent, racist, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, xenophobic, and 
anti-immigrant language and ideals, I am clear that this resolution is 
another ill-intentioned attempt to persecute dissenting voices who 
refuse to stay silent and whose perspective challenges this body and 
the dominant narrative.
  We must resist the urge to scapegoat and vilify those who disagree 
with us, and I unequivocally stand with my friend, Rashida Tlaib. I 
will be voting against the resolution, and I encourage my friends to do 
your job.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. Omar).
  Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, it is glaring hypocrisy when you have 
Republicans on the other side of the aisle trying to create definitions 
and say Rashida wants to annihilate people when Max Miller himself went 
on TV and said we are turning Gaza into a parking lot and we want to 
annihilate Palestinians. Nobody condemned him on that side of the 
aisle.
  What is true here is that every single one of them has not 
acknowledged the fact that Palestinians are dying in the tens of 
thousands but will continue to say it is us who are not acknowledging 
humanity.
  Rashida will stand strong, and the Palestinian movement will continue 
for liberation until every single Palestinian has the right to live in 
liberty.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).
  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, on October 7, Hamas terrorists paraglided into 
a music festival and began an unprovoked spree of violence. Babies were 
beheaded, young girls raped, hundreds kidnapped, and many murdered in 
vile ways.
  To compare a modern democracy with a repressive terrorist state is 
wrong, but it is also wrong for Congress to take this action at a time 
when we have serious issues that we face. To take an action and take 
down the words, to strike the words, to censure a fellow Member, no 
matter how incorrect we believe she may be, is wrong.
  We lower ourselves when we try to take action against someone else 
for their words. We all go back to our districts, and thank goodness 
social media hasn't caught every one of us with everything that we say 
back in our districts because we would all be standing here.

  This is a wrong time to do this. It is the wrong action to take. 
Let's pass a resolution condemning this kind of language, condemning 
anti-Semitism on college campuses and elsewhere, but it is absolutely 
wrong to vote for this motion.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I don't think that my 
colleagues have caught us in any kind of contradiction when they raised 
the case of Representative Gosar, who posted a video on social media 
depicting himself killing our colleague Representative Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez and also attacking President Biden. This was a true 
threat. These were fighting words. This is something that is totally 
within our First Amendment tradition.
  Mr. Speaker, we live in a time of terror and war, great polarization 
and trauma across the world. We must grapple the rule of law to our 
souls with hoops of steel at this moment. In a time of all kinds of 
storms all over the world, the rule of law, the Constitution, is our 
shore, and now is a moment to hug the shore.
  Let's defend the freedom of speech for today, for tomorrow, and going 
forward in the Congress of the United States.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert this 
article from 11 Alive News, titled: ``Metro Atlanta woman killed in 
Jerusalem: reports,'' dated November 6, 2023.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Georgia?
  There was no objection.

                    [From 11alive.com, Nov. 6, 2023]

            Metro Atlanta Woman Killed in Jerusalem: Reports

                           (By 11Alive Staff)

       Jerusalem, Israel--A metro Atlanta woman was killed Monday 
     morning in a stabbing attack in Jerusalem, news outlets 
     reported.
       According to the Atlanta Jewish Times, Elisheva Rose Ida 
     Lubin, 20, grew up in Dunwoody. Gov. Brian Kemp commented on 
     the tragedy and shared the Atlanta Jewish Times' article on 
     social media.
       ``Marty, the girls, and I are heartbroken by the tragic 
     news of Rose Lubin's death,'' the governor said.
       Kemp said he would keep her family in his thoughts and 
     prayers during this difficult time.
       Lubin was a member of the Israel Border Police, the Wall 
     Street Journal shared in a live updates story about the 
     ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. She lived in Kibbutz Sa'ad in 
     southern Israel. The WSJ also mentioned that the area was one 
     of the places attacked on Oct. 7.
       It's been nearly a month since officials said Hamas 
     attacked Israel in an ``unprecedented'' move. Thousands of 
     lives have been lost.
  Mr. McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I know there is a lot of passion today. I 
heard a lot of screaming. I heard a lot of accusations, you could say, 
on both sides.
  I don't really care what race, religion, or gender orientation you 
are. Where I come from in the Marine Corps, we are all shades of green, 
and we all bleed red. That is the truth. I just care about the person 
who has my back.
  When I was student body president at Morehouse School of Medicine, I 
was elected by my peers--60 percent females, 80 percent Black, 95 
percent liberal. Why? I was elected because I love people. I love 
people of all sorts. This isn't about who you are. It is about what you 
represent, what this body represents. That is what this debate is 
about.
  If this is not worthy of censure, I don't know what it is. 
Representative Tlaib has stoked anti-Semitism in this Nation and 
undermined our national security.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about 
this dangerous rise that we are seeing in anti-Semitism. We are seeing 
it in this country, and we are seeing it all around the world.
  One of the most important vows that our Nation made to the Jewish 
people is the vow of ``never again.'' I have a simple question. Are we 
doing everything that we can to keep that vow in the wake of October 7 
and the Hamas terrorist attack against Israel? A month ago, Hamas 
killed more Jews in a single day than at any time since the Holocaust. 
Yet some students, professors, and public officials in our country are 
indulging and even endorsing this act, which to me is torture and mass 
murder, and anyone who has witnessed the videos could say nothing but 
torture and mass murder.
  Once again, the Jewish people are being threatened simply for who 
they are and for what they believe. It is happening to individuals all 
around the country and around the world. There are those who are 
praising the horrific mass murder, torture, and kidnapping of Jews by 
Hamas terrorists. Some of that praise is even coming from right here in 
Washington, DC, and across our country.
  Anti-Semitic incidents of vandalism, harassment, and assault are up 
almost 400 percent compared to this time a year ago. In October of 
2022, there were 64 total anti-Semitic incidents reported in America. 
October 7, 2023--the day Hamas attacked Israel--since that day to 
today, over 300 reported incidents. That is a 400-percent increase 
compared to last year, and that is in America alone.
  Anti-Semitism is festering on college campuses. You probably heard 
about several of these incidents. Fifty-one student groups, including 
at Berkeley, the University of Michigan, and UCLA, signed a letter in 
support of Hamas's brutal terrorist, murderous attacks. Students at 
George Washington University, right here, located in our Nation's 
Capital, held a vigil that they described as a ``Vigil for the Martyrs 
of Palestine.'' And they projected ``Glory to our Martyrs'' right on 
the library wall. It is disturbing and it is hateful.

  A pro-Hamas mob at Cooper Union University in New York City stormed 
the library. The mob started banging on doors and windows. Jewish 
students were trapped. They feared for their lives. Eventually, they 
had to be escorted to safety. No one has been punished.
  A Cornell student was arrested last week for posting anti-Semitic 
death threats on the school's messaging boards. Weeks earlier, a 
Cornell professor said he was exhilarated by Hamas's brutality. 
Students at Tulane University, which is 40 percent Jewish, were also 
attacked. Pro-Hamas protesters tried to burn an Israeli flag. One 
speaker at Princeton University went so far as to equate Israel with 
Nazi Germany. After a mass murder of innocent Jewish mothers, fathers, 
children, and Holocaust survivors, radical students and professors in 
this country have the gall to compare the Jews to those who sought to 
systemically kill them during the holocaust.
  Let's imagine that we are Jewish students who go to these schools and 
live in these communities. Here is how one Jewish student describes her 
situation on campus. This young lady said:

       It is terrifying to see classmates call for violence 
     against Jews so confidently and so publicly.

  In other words, for many Jewish students, ``never again'' has turned 
into ``nowhere is safe.''
  The University of Wyoming, rightly, has called out the evil in the 
wake of the terrorist attack against Israel. Our University President, 
Ed Seidel, and our Provost, Kevin Carman, condemned the ``heinous . . . 
acts of terrorism'' against Israel. Every university should do the 
same.
  America can't turn its back on the Jewish people of Israel or on 
Israel. That is exactly what I fear we are seeing right now.
  Hamas's brutality is front page news every single day. Israel is 
clear-eyed in its mission to destroy Hamas. Instead of standing 
shoulder to shoulder with our closest ally in the Middle East, the 
Biden administration is currently calling for a ``pause.'' The United 
Nations' 120 members recently voted in favor of a resolution calling 
for a cease-fire. In the House of Representatives right down the hall, 
a group of Members known as the Squad are also demanding a cease-fire. 
I didn't hear them call for a cease-fire when Hamas attacked Israel. 
They only want Israel to stop defending itself. That is the role of the 
Squad.
  There already was a cease-fire before October 7. Hamas broke that 
cease-fire. More than 1,400 innocent Israelis and Americans are now 
dead. A pause or a cease-fire now would only help Hamas dig in and 
rearm. I am against a pause. I am against a cease-fire. America should 
never take action that could help terrorists prevail. To me, that is 
what a cease-fire would do.
  Instead of a cease-fire, we need to cease paying Hamas; we need to 
cease paying Iran; and we need to cease being silent in the face of 
anti-Semitism.
  Moments like this are very concerning and also moments like this are 
very clarifying. America has existed from the very beginning to protect 
our freedom of religion. As President George Washington wrote in a 
letter to a Newport synagogue in 1790--he said America promises to give 
``bigotry no sanction.''
  America stands on the values of respect and toleration.
  When we vowed ``never again,'' we meant it and continue to mean it 
today. As we confront the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, 
our entire Nation must do everything we can to keep our word.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHMITT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mr. SCHMITT. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a 
problem that is plaguing our great country.
  Americans and the rest of the world woke up on October 7 to horrific 
scenes in Israel, and the ensuing news reports of Hamas's terrorist 
attack brought to light even more gruesome details--thousands of 
innocent Israelis slaughtered, babies decapitated, people burned alive, 
horrific scenes of brutality and brazen disregard for humanity by Hamas 
terrorists. Israel and American hostages are still awaiting rescue.
  These past few weeks following the terrorist attack, there has been a 
frightening rise of anti-Semitism, particularly on college campuses and 
from

[[Page S5412]]

younger generations in America's major cities.
  Jewish students at Cooper Union in New York City had to shelter in a 
library while pro-Palestinian students banged on windows and doors in a 
frightening incident. Anonymous posters on a Cornell message board 
threatened violence, all while a Cornell professor proclaimed Hamas 
terrorist attacks to be ``exhilarating'' and ``energizing.'' Countless 
videos show students and even teachers tearing down missing posters for 
Israeli hostages. The list goes on and on.
  Some may be surprised by these incidents, but for those who have been 
paying attention, it is anything but shocking. For years, the American 
left has embraced identity politics--DEI and critical race theory. For 
years, students at some of this country's most elite colleges have had 
this race essentialism, this oppressor-versus-oppressed ideology, 
hammered into their heads.
  They have tried to make moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas. 
Every single situation or issue is viewed through the lens of race or 
other immutable characteristics.
  If you don't rank high enough on the totem pole of grievances or 
score well on the oppression matrix, well, then your views aren't as 
important. Being right has taken a back seat to your skin color.
  DEI and CRT are fruit of the poisonous tree of cultural Marxism, and 
it is playing out right now in our streets. The proof is in the numbers 
as well. A Harvard CAPS/Harris poll states that when voters were asked 
whom they sided with in the Israeli-Hamas conflict, 95 percent of 
voters age 65 or older said Israel, while only 5 percent said Hamas. In 
the 18-to-24 age range, 52 percent said Israel, while 48 percent said 
Hamas. That is a startling generational divide and shows just how 
entrenched this divisive ideology is.
  This ideology completely strips people of their individuality. Ideas 
don't really matter as much as what the person speaking looks like. It 
is completely antithetical to the core tenets of our Constitution and 
the American experiment. It places an unhealthy emphasis on race. It 
strips people of their dignity and the many layers that define us. It 
rips away the ties that bind us, and that is exactly the point for 
these cultural Marxists.
  We need to return to the American idea--equality of opportunity, not 
certainty of outcome or so-called equity. We need to prioritize merit 
over characteristics that people have no control over. We need to push 
back against the poisonous DEI and CRT ideology--an ideology that has 
even made its way into grade schools, where school-age kids are being 
forced to participate in things called a privilege walk. Until we do 
that, we will continue to see more race essentialism from groups like 
Black Lives Matter and more chants of ``from the river to the sea.'' 
That is not what America is about, but we better get real about the 
problem before it is too late to fix it."

  Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, on October 7, Hamas terrorists crossed 
the border of Israel and committed atrocities, the full extent of which 
we are only just now coming to understand.
  Thousands of innocent Israelis have lost their lives. Israeli babies 
were beheaded--literally beheaded--put into ovens, according to news 
reports. Innocent civilians were shot in their homes when they answered 
their front doors. Soldiers who were asleep in their beds were 
executed. And the terrorist attacks have continued.
  Amazingly, in the United States--even as this terrible attack was 
unfolding in Israel--in the United States, hundreds and thousands of 
students and others took to America's campuses to express solidarity, 
not with innocent Israelis who had lost their lives but with Hamas, and 
to voice support for the genocidal campaign that Hamas has sought to 
carry out and continues to advance and advocate even as we stand here 
today.
  Take a look at just some of the things that have been said by 
students on America's college campuses. Students at Harvard University 
said they held the Israeli regime ``entirely responsible''--entirely 
responsible--``for all the unfolding violence.'' You had students at 
the University of North Carolina who said they believed it was their 
``moral obligation to be in solidarity with the dispossessed, no matter 
the pathway to liberation they choose to take. This includes 
violence.''
  Oh, and Hamas is violent. There is no doubt we have seen 
extraordinary violence, unbelievable violence, in the most brutal 
attack on Israel and the Jewish people in 50 years.
  Students at New York University School of Law wrote that they 
expressed first and foremost their unwavering and absolute solidarity 
with Palestinians and their resistance against oppression toward 
liberation and self-determination. ``Israel,'' they said, ``bears full 
responsibility for this tremendous loss of life.''
  I could go on. And I am happy to say that this body has unanimously 
condemned these statements--this progenocidal rhetoric--by students in 
this country.
  I wish that it had stopped at rhetoric, but it hasn't. We have seen 
the assaults

[[Page S5419]]

on Jewish students right on our campuses. We have seen Jews barricaded 
in university libraries, unable to leave, as pro-Hamas demonstrators 
shout and scream outside calling for the destruction of Israel. We have 
seen Jewish students physically assaulted--if you don't believe me, 
just go look on the internet--physically assaulted on American campuses 
by pro-Hamas demonstrators.
  We have even seen it in high schools, where students are chanting:

       From the river to the sea, Palestine must be free.

  What does that mean? It is a call for the destruction of the State of 
Israel. It is a call for the execution of Jews in the Middle East, in 
this country, everywhere. That is the Hamas agenda.
  And so many Americans, including me, have been absolutely stunned to 
see so many students and others echoing these claims. And it has raised 
the question: Where is this coming from? Where are these students and 
young people--teenagers--where are they hearing this? Where are they 
seeing it? Where are they being fed this propaganda? Because 
propaganda, it is.
  At least one of the answers is, they are finding it on TikTok. Yes, 
TikTok, that Chinese-based, Chinese-owned social media app that is a 
back door for the Chinese Communist Party to track the movements, the 
key strokes, the whereabouts, the information of every American who has 
the app on their phone.
  What we know now is that for many, many younger Americans--the so-
called Generation Z; those in their teens and early twenties--so many 
of them--74 percent of them, in fact--use TikTok as a search engine. 
And, in fact, a majority of them prefer TikTok to Google as a principle 
search engine. So where are Americans and Generation Z increasingly 
getting their news? What are they using to search for information? They 
are using TikTok. They are getting their news from TikTok.
  At the same time, this same cohort of young Americans, more than 50 
percent of them--this is young Americans between the ages of 18 and 
24--more than 50 percent of them say they believe Hamas's murder of 
civilians was justified. Let me repeat that. More than 50 percent of 
young Americans--Gen Z, between the ages of 18 and 24--believe Hamas's 
murder of civilians was justified.
  These are the same people who are going on TikTok to get their news, 
to get their information, to be influenced. And they certainly are 
being influenced. Media reports have analyzed the prevalence of anti-
Israel, anti-Semitic, pro-Hamas content on TikTok. It is really quite 
astounding.
  Just take a look at the trending hashtags: ``Stand with Palestine,'' 
285 million views, impressions, according to the news site Axios and 
their recent analysis. By contrast, ``Stand With Israel'' has far, far 
less--64 million. This doesn't actually begin to tell the story because 
the truth is, there are other hashtags, other pro-Hamas, pro-
Palestinian sources of information where the views are even larger. 
Take, for instance ``Free Palestine.'' That has received actually 917 
million views, far outpacing even ``Stand with Palestine'' and 
dramatically outpacing the content that is actually supportive of the 
State of Israel.
  Here is my point. TikTok has become a haven for anti-Semitic content, 
a haven for propaganda for genocide. Of course, TikTok denies this, as 
they deny any responsibility for anything they actually do.
  They have tried to say, in fact, these numbers are skewed. But you 
can't change the facts. You can't deny the reality that their site is 
absolutely awash with this content. And we know that part of the 
problem, the danger of TikTok, is it gives the Chinese Communist Party 
enormous influence--enormous influence--to shape the news, the content 
of the information of the folks who look at it.
  They have done this before. Back in 2019, the Chinese Communist Party 
used TikTok to suppress content that criticized the Chinese Government 
over their oppression and enslavement of the Uighurs in that country. 
They have a pattern of using this application to try and shape the 
narrative in the way they want it shaped. How they are shaping it now 
is pumping out the most virulent, toxic pro-Hamas propaganda.
  Madam President, the time has come to take another look at TikTok. I 
will say this: As virulent and offensive as this content is, that is 
not a reason to ban them. The real reason to ban TikTok is that it is a 
spy app for the Chinese Communist government. Let's just look at what 
we have learned since I was last on this floor trying to pass 
legislation that would hold TikTok accountable and ban it from American 
phones.

  On the 24th of this year, the New York Times reported that driver's 
licenses, addresses and photos--just to be clear, Americans' driver's 
licenses, addresses, and photos--were accessed by TikTok engineers 
based in China. What is extraordinary about this is TikTok has told us 
over and over and over again that this was impossible. They have come 
to this Congress, they testified before us and said this never happens. 
American data is absolutely sequestered. You can't access it in China. 
It is completely safe.
  Yet we learned this year what, really, we already knew: That simply 
is not true. Let's not forget, the law of China--the People's Republic 
of China, a dictatorship--their law requires all major corporations, 
including, especially, data corporations, to make information available 
upon request to the Chinese Communist Party. That means your data. That 
means our personal information.
  On May 30, Forbes magazine reported that TikTok creators'--that means 
American users'--financial information, Social Security numbers were, 
in fact, being stored in China. We had also been told this wasn't true. 
We have been told by TikTok: No, no, no, Americans' data is always 
stored in America. It can't be accessed anywhere but in America. There 
is a firewall between America and China.
  Not true. Not true.
  Americans don't realize that their data is being tracked. They are 
just on there to make their videos and put out their content. And what 
is happening? The Chinese Government is able to access it. Their 
personal information is being stored, not in this country, but in 
China, with full availability to the Chinese Communist Party.
  On November 1, just a few days ago, Forbes further reported that a 
platform storing TikTok corporate secrets was inspected by the Chinese 
Government. Of course, it was. Chinese law requires it. It requires 
TikTok and its parent company ByteDance to make available all of this 
information to the Chinese Government.
  We have confronted dangers like this before from China. Huawei is a 
prime example. Huawei, another Chinese-based corporation also subject 
to the laws of China requiring the sharing of personal information and 
data. And what did we do? We stood up a sanctions regime that 
sanctioned Huawei and prevented its use here in the United States. And 
we went further than that. We actually went to our allies and partners 
and said that we would not cooperate with them and offer them security 
assistance. We are talking about other countries right now. We would 
not cooperate with them or offer security assistance unless they took 
Huawei out of their 5G networks.
  We should do the same with TikTok. We should protect the people of 
this Nation. We should be honest with them about what TikTok actually 
does. And we should protect them from the relentless spying and 
surveillance by a foreign government.
  I want to be clear. I don't like a lot of what American Big Tech 
does. I doubt you will find a harsher critic of Big Tech than I am in 
this Chamber. But there is a big difference between an American company 
looking at Americans' data--accessing Americans' data--and a foreign 
government tracking Americans, building dossiers on Americans, and 
using it as a back door into the life of every American citizen who has 
that app on his or her phone.
  It is time to put an end to this. We have already voted to do it. We 
voted to strip TikTok off of every government device just 10 months 
ago. States are doing it all across the country. It is time we took the 
step to protect the American people, to protect the integrity of 
Americans' personal information and their personal privacy.
  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from further 
consideration of

[[Page S5420]]

S. 85 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I further 
ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cortez Masto). Is there objection?
  The Senator from Kentucky.
  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we are here 
once again faced with the proposal to ban TikTok and to forbid millions 
of Americans from expressing their opinion.
  This is not a subject that we should entertain lightly. If there is a 
better national strategy to permanently lose elections for a 
generation, I have not heard of it. Banning TikTok, a social media app 
used by 150 million Americans, primarily young Americans, is a recipe 
for electoral disaster for Republicans.
  This GOP strategy comes just after an election year in which a 
national survey indicated that 71 percent of young women and 53 percent 
of young men voted for the Democrat candidate for Congress. Now, 
admittedly, many Democrats have also joined Republicans in calling for 
this ban, but like most issues, the blame tends to stick to Republicans 
more.
  The banning TikTok strategy also comes while the GOP simultaneously 
complains of liberal U.S. social media companies canceling and 
censoring conservatives. So without a hint of irony, many of these same 
``conservatives'' now agitate to censor viewpoints they don't like.
  So on the one hand, Republicans complain about censorship, while with 
the other hand, these same Republicans advocate to censor social media 
apps that they worry are influenced by the Chinese. The concern over 
TikTok seems to be over what the social media app might do. Propagating 
hysteria and fear of subtle communist subversion from the People's 
Republic of China through a social media app in the 21st century, is 
similar or akin to basically McCarthyist paranoia.
  Today, in a move that Chairman Mao himself would approve, the Senate 
considers banning a platform because it seems one Member doesn't 
approve of how it handled content about the war between Israel and 
Hamas.
  Just this week, the Senator from Missouri wrote to Secretary Yellen:

       While data security issues are paramount, less often 
     discussed is TikTok's power to radically distort the world-
     picture that America's young people encounter.

  The Senator from Missouri wants to censor TikTok users who are biased 
against Israel. The Senator from Missouri wants to ban the speech of 
young TikTok users he disagrees with. Sounds more like a Chinese 
solution than an American one.
  The Chinese solution to combating speech those in power do not like 
is to ban it. In fact, TikTok is banned in China. So is YouTube, 
Twitter, and Facebook.
  There is an app similar to TikTok called Douyin that operates in 
China, but it is heavily censored. Try to search for ``Tiananmen 1989'' 
on Douyin, and nothing will come up.
  The American solution, with the high value that our country places on 
the free exchange of ideas, is to counter flawed ideas--flawed ideas--
or falsities with more speech and better arguments that persuade and 
reveal the truth.
  Do we really want to emulate China's speech bans? Do we really want 
to intrude into the lives of Americans and deprive them of their First 
Amendment right to receive and consider information?
  The ham-fisted ban under consideration today empowers the government 
to determine what Americans are allowed to see, hear, and contemplate. 
The headline of an opinion piece recently by John Tamny says it all: 
``Nauseating Harassment of TikTok Presumes Americans Will Be Saved From 
Chinese Authoritarianism If U.S. Politicians Act Like Chinese 
Authoritarians.''
  A ban on TikTok is what they do in China. You are worried about 
Chinese communism and Chinese authoritarianism, and you want to ban 
speech in our country? It is inconsistent with our very American 
primary principles. TikTok must be banned, the censors say, because 
they are owned and controlled by the Chinese Communist Government. In 
actuality, TikTok is owned by international investors and two Chinese 
software engineers who designed the app.
  Does TikTok do the Chinese Government's bidding? Well, go to the app 
and search for Falun Gong, the anti-communist religious sect that is 
persecuted in China. Go to TikTok and search for videos advocating 
Taiwan's independence, criticism of Chinese Premier Xi Jinping. These 
videos are all over TikTok that are critical of Chinese positions. That 
is why TikTok is banned in China.
  TikTok is banned in China, but you want to ban it in the United 
States. We are going to become like the Chinese to prevent the Chinese 
from taking over our country?
  As Drs. Mueller and Farhat of Georgia Tech write, ``If nationalist 
fears about Chinese influence operations lead to a departure from 
American constitutional principles supporting free and open political 
discourse, we will have succeeded in undermining our [very] system of 
government more effectively than any Chinese propaganda could ever 
do.''
  We will be doing what the Chinese want. If you are worried about 
becoming Chinese communists, you will now be emulating them by banning 
speech. To those who were worried that the Chinese Government might 
somehow have access to millions of American teenagers' info, realize 
that all social media, regardless of whether their ownership is foreign 
or domestic, sucks up all your personal data, and this is what people 
provide voluntarily.

  And, people, if you don't want your information--don't join these 
groups. If you are going to ban TikTok, what is next? Arguably, several 
domestic apps censor conservatives more. I know because I have been 
censored and banned by American companies. I have got no love lost with 
any of these companies. I have a host of complaints about domestic 
social media platforms that cancel conservatives, but I am not in favor 
of banning them or forcing them to accept my opinion. They are private 
companies. They have speech rights. I have speech rights, but I don't 
have the right to force them or to ban them if they don't post my 
stuff.
  If you don't like TikTok or Facebook or YouTube, don't use them. But 
don't think any interpretation of the Constitution gives you the right 
to ban them. The First Amendment isn't necessary to protect speech that 
everybody likes or everybody accepts. The First Amendment exists to 
protect speech that might be unpopular or might be controversial.
  I hope saner minds will reflect on which is more dangerous, videos of 
teenagers dancing or the President of the U.S. Government banning 
speech. For me, it is an easy answer. I will defend the Bill of Rights 
against all comers, even, if need be, from Members of my own party.
  I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.
  The Senator from Missouri.
  Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, let's just be clear about one thing. The 
Chinese Communist Government is not covered by the U.S. Bill of Rights.
  The Chinese Communist Government does not have free speech rights, 
and we are not talking about free speech. We are not talking about 
speech at all. The sanctions that I am proposing have nothing to do 
with speech; they have everything to do with spying, for the same 
reasons that we have banned Huawei in this country.
  If the Senator would like to have a debate about whether or not 
Huawei and its affiliates ought to be banned, whether it ought to be a 
sanctions regime for those that engage in espionage, I welcome it. That 
is the same debate we are having here.
  I just say this. If all of those teenagers and other creators from 
around the world who are putting all of the pro-genocidal Hamas content 
onto TikTok want to go do it on other platforms, be my guest. I will be 
right here to criticize them and call them out for their moral 
atrocities wherever they do it.
  But the reason to ban TikTok in this country is that it is a spying 
apparatus of the Chinese Communist Party. The facts simply cannot be 
disputed. ByteDance is subject to the laws of China, which make 
American data available to, accessible to, upon request for Chinese 
corporations and the Chinese Government.

[[Page S5421]]

  I just lament that we cannot seem to move forward with a step that we 
have already taken with regard to Huawei, with sensible protection of 
Americans' privacy and their personal data.
  But let me just close with this. With regard to the speech itself, 
while the content of the speech on TikTok is no reason to ban them, I 
just want to say, since we are here in this moment of great dispute, 
apparently, in some quarters of this country over whether it is right 
or wrong to call for the genocide of Jewish people, I want to say, 
clearly, it is wrong. And I want to say to those creators who are 
pumping out this content on TikTok: You may have a First Amendment 
right to do so, but you don't really have moral standing.
  We need to be clear. There is a right. There is a wrong. There is 
good. There is evil. And calling for the genocide of Jewish people, 
whether it is in the Middle East, the State of Israel, or in this 
country is wrong. Whether you do it on TikTok or Meta or YouTube or 
just on the streets and plazas of your college campus, it is wrong.
  And at this time, above all times, I think, we need to stand and make 
that clear.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.
  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, the bill before us to ban TikTok is 
clearly infringement of the First Amendment. It would ban 150 million 
people who regularly post on TikTok from expressing themselves.
  It is without question speech. These folks, the 150 million users of 
TikTok, would have standing in court to sue over infringement of their 
speech.
  This isn't about who was advocating for this or that in the Middle 
East or in Israel or in the Hamas situation. The Supreme Court has 
looked at speech over time, and there is some speech that is not 
protected.
  But in Europe, they have gone one step further, in the sense that 
they ban all kinds of speech in Europe. You have certain opinions that 
can't be expressed. We have never done that in our country. You can 
have a foul, despicable opinion in our country, and we counter it with 
better ideas. We counter it with better speech. It is very, very 
dangerous to the primary principles of our founding, of our government, 
of our Bill of Rights, of the Bill of Right that is listed first, and 
that is freedom of speech. And my hope is that this will not be seen as 
a serious proposal and will be rejected.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.
  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up 
to 5 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered."

it takes back more than $10 billion in funding provided in the 
Inflation Reduction Act. This is on top of cuts to the IRS that the 
majority is pursuing as a condition for providing aid to Israel, and in 
addition to the $57 billion in cuts to the IRS' Inflation Reduction Act 
funding in the other 11 appropriations bills.;  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 847, the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that I hope 
will garner bipartisan support. I do this with my colleagues on the 
House Financial Services Committee. Chairman Blaine Luetkemeyer of 
Missouri is here with me today.
  In 2021, Mr. Chair, the Treasury Department approved $650 billion in 
an allocation of Special Drawing Rights at the International Monetary 
Fund. That is a bunch of technical words, but in plain English, this 
means that they were lavishing $650 billion on all the countries of the 
world with no strings attached.
  The Biden administration claims that this allocation is necessary to 
have the global adequacy of funding in reserves in each of the 
sovereign countries of the world. In other words, these reserves from 
the IMF went to healthy countries, countries that don't need the money, 
like countries in Europe or the United States. Many countries ended up 
using this IMF money just to pay short-term bills.
  Worst of all, this Special Drawing Rights allocation provided 
billions of dollars of unconditional liquidity to some of the worst 
regimes in the world: $40 billion went to China; $17 billion went to 
the Putin regime in Moscow; and Iran, the world's leading state sponsor 
of terrorism, the funder of Hamas, the killer of Israelis on October 7, 
received $5 billion to boost its reserves.
  That is completely at odds with American policy, completely at odds 
with our sanctions policy against some of the worst regimes in the 
world.
  The amendment we propose today would prohibit the Treasury Department 
from allocating any more Special Drawing Rights from the IMF to the 
ayatollahs in Tehran.

[[Page H5623]]

  Following the October 7 attack by Hamas against our friends in 
Israel, it would be unacceptable for the IMF to, once again, bolster 
the reserves of Iran. Money is fungible, and that money goes to 
Hezbollah and Hamas.
  Some of our colleagues might counter that prohibiting more SDRs for 
Iran means prohibiting them for everybody. That is simply not true.
  Mr. Chairman, the IMF has the authority to do special allocations and 
allocate these Special Drawing Rights reserves to countries of a 
particular need or concern. We don't have to give this kind of largesse 
to wealthy countries like the Netherlands or the United States or to 
rogues like China and Iran.
  Some may argue that excluding this is too dramatic and that Treasury 
itself can designate the whole country as a jurisdiction of primary 
money laundering concern, and therefore, Iran can't get it.
  This administration has already freed up money for Iran in their 
recent hostage deal. If Treasury really wants to argue that Iran, the 
world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism, should receive more no-
strings-attached money, then come to Congress to make the case, but 
this is significant and should be decided by the elected officials in 
this body, not agency officials at the Treasury.
  Last month's assault on Israel was a clarifying moment for so many 
people around the world. This amendment sends a unified message: No 
more money for bad regimes around the world.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This 
amendment doesn't belong in this bill. We don't deal with the IMF and 
Special Drawing Rights. That would be in the State-Foreign Operations 
bill, which we have already taken up on the floor.
  Mr. Chair, I urge the sponsor to take up that bill in the fiscal year 
2025 bill, assuming we ever get to that.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Chair, I don't consider that a very convincing argument 
on this amendment. This amendment is a good idea to counter a bad 
policy.
  Blanket money for rogue regimes through the IMF, approved by our 
Treasury Department and encouraged by the Biden administration, is bad.
  Voting for this amendment is good. It sends a message to rogue 
regimes: You don't get a free lunch from the United States of America.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chair, as I said, we are not debating the merits of 
the amendment. It is just not appropriate in this bill, period.
  Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arkansas has 1 minute remaining.
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Chair, let me say, in conclusion, that this is the 
Treasury bill. This is the bill that appropriates money for the 
Treasury.
  The Rules Committee made this amendment in order because it concerns 
spending money at the Treasury for bad ideas. Those on this side of the 
aisle want to counter terrorism, counter bad ideas, counter profligate 
spending by the IMF to back up rogue regimes.
  Mr. Chair, I encourage all Members who want to counter terrorism, 
counter rogue regimes, speak up for freedom in Israel, speak up for 
freedom in Ukraine, speak up for freedom on the island of Taiwan to 
support this amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).
  The amendment was agreed to.; The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 65 
printed in part B of House Report 118-269.
  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the 
     following:
       Sec. __.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made 
     available by this Act may be made available to authorize a 
     transaction by a United States financial institution (as 
     defined under section 561.309 of title 31, Code of Federal 
     Regulations) for a person whose property and interests in 
     property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13902, other 
     than a transaction for the sale of agricultural commodities, 
     food, medicine, or medical devices.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 847, the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.
  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, this is sort of a continuation of my friend 
Mr. Hill's amendment and Mr. Barr's, and other amendments that we have 
talked about today, which is really about whether we are going to allow 
the largest state funder of terrorism to continue to have access to 
hard dollars and continue to have access to the capital that is funding 
groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestine Islamic Jihad.
  Mr. Chair, the deadly terror attacks of October 7 made one thing 
abundantly clear: The United States cannot continue to allow the 
Iranian regime access to funding that, in turn, could be used against 
our allies and even American citizens.
  I am pleased to offer this amendment today, and I hope it will 
receive bipartisan support because a very similar amendment, Mr. Chair, 
received a voice vote in 2016 right along these lines.
  Last month's barbaric attack against our friends and allies in Israel 
was a powerful reminder of the dangers posed by Hamas and others.
  By the way, Hamas, receives 93 percent of their total funding from 
Tehran. As we mentioned, Tehran and Iran, being the world's leading 
state sponsor of terrorism, must be cut off from their ability to wage 
hostilities abroad.
  As far-reaching as our Iranian sanctions are, it may surprise some of 
my colleagues that we have not actually closed all the financing 
loopholes. The administration still enjoys significant discretion to 
permit trade and financial services with these bad actors even if it 
has nothing to do with humanitarian purposes. My amendment would change 
this.
  Under Executive Order No. 13902, the Trump administration made the 
construction, mining, manufacturing, and textile sectors of the Iranian 
economy subject to U.S. sanctions, in addition to sanctions in place, 
many going back to the 2012 NDAA. The Treasury Department later added 
the financial sector to this group, blacklisting 18 Iranian banks in 
October 2020. At the same time, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset 
Control, also known as OFAC, retains broad discretion to license 
transactions with sanctioned Iranians.
  Under the Obama administration's nuclear deal, for example, Treasury 
licensed aircraft sales to Iran Air, which had previously been 
sanctioned for providing support to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
Corps, also known as the IRGC, and to the Defense Ministry.
  An amendment to the FSGG appropriations bill to prohibit these 
licenses was adopted by the House in 2016 by voice vote.
  We must not let licenses undermine sanctions under these executive 
orders, which is why my amendment would prohibit them if they allow 
Iran to use the U.S. financial system. It is that simple.
  The attack on Israel has underscored how we cannot become complacent 
when it comes to blocking Iran from the goods, technology, and hard 
currency it needs to fund terrorist groups, such as Hamas, Hezbollah, 
Palestine Islamic Jihad, and many others.
  In addition to being the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, 
Iran has been designated by Treasury as a jurisdiction of primary 
laundering concern.
  Mr. Hill just referenced in his amendment that Treasury does have the 
ability to put these jurisdictions on money laundering, but they have 
rescinded that, Mr. Chair. They allow these exemptions.

[[Page H5624]]

  That is why Mr. Hill's amendment, my amendment, and other amendments 
are trying to narrow that down and tighten that down. Clearly, we 
should shield our financial institutions from contact with the country 
to the fullest extent possible.
  Now, let me address potential objections. Some might ask about 
humanitarian aid under this measure.
  My amendment does nothing--let me repeat, nothing--to affect existing 
exemptions for agricultural commodities, food, medicine, or medical 
devices. These exemptions have long been codified into our laws, and 
this amendment does not change that. This is explicit in the text of 
the amendment.
  Mr. Chair, you may have heard and seen those media reports about 
phantom false billing that might be happening or black market deals 
where those goods and services are delivered and being misused and even 
sold on the black market for that cash. That is another issue, and we 
need to address that, but that is not what we are getting at here in 
this one.
  Others might ask whether this amendment could limit Treasury's 
ability to license transactions as future ransom for hostages, for 
example, or even as part of a new nuclear deal.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote for my 
amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.
  The Treasury Department has identified significant technical concerns 
with this amendment. Specifically, the agency has concerns about how 
the amendment's construction would impact general licenses authorized 
by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
  I strongly agree with the need to enforce the sanctions included in 
Executive Order No. 13902 with respect to any person determined to 
operate in the construction, mining, manufacturing, or textile sectors 
of the Iranian economy. However, some terms like ``Islamic Republic of 
Iran'' and ``for, or on behalf of'' are vague and would create 
confusion as to how they would relate to existing authorizations.
  Treasury believes this phrasing could cause unintended consequences 
outside of the intended scope.
  Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I oppose the amendment and recommend a 
``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time."

Mr. President, a month and a half ago, Hamas terrorists 
committed a horrific act of barbarism. More than 1,200 innocent 
Israelis and 33 Americans were murdered in coldblooded acts of evil. It 
was the deadliest massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust and 
the deadliest foreign attack on Americans since 9/11.
  The Middle East is no stranger to violence, but the October 7 attack 
was particularly heinous: systematically hunting down and slaughtering 
young people at a concert; kidnapping elderly women out of their homes; 
beheading babies and burning them in ovens. The line between good and 
evil is as clear as it has ever been.
  For the remaining innocent hostages currently being illegally held in 
Gaza, the terrorists and the terror continue. While we are grateful for 
the release of some hostages over the weekend, our hearts remain with 
those still being held. This includes several Americans, including 
Keith Siegel, a native of my home State of North Carolina.
  So let me be as clear as I can: Hamas's continued holding of these 
innocent hostages is a violation of the law, and it represents a 
complete disrespect for the value of human life. Every single one of 
them must be released, and all levels of our government must remain 
united in working to get them home.
  In this clash between good and evil, the question that the United 
States should be asking is, Who can we count on to be on our side, and 
who stands on the side of the terrorists?
  This brings us to the state of Qatar. This is a nation that hosts 
Hamas's so-called political office, including Hamas leaders. From the 
safety of Doha, these terrorists gleefully watched and celebrated the 
attacks on October 7.
  Now, it is important to remember that Qatar is a major non-NATO ally 
of the United States, and it hosts U.S. military forces at Al Udeid Air 
Base--a strategically important location for our operations in the 
Middle East. Our two nations are friends, but sometimes friends must be 
honest with one another.
  You see, Qatar claims that they only host Hamas at the request of the 
U.S. Government and in coordination with Israel. There is some truth to 
this. Since October 7, Biden administration officials, such as CIA 
Director Burns, have beaten a path toward Doha, hoping that the Qatari 
Government's hosting of Hamas's senior leadership would provide a 
pathway toward ending the hostage crisis that Hamas initiated.
  I certainly agree that the U.S. Government, including both the 
administration and Congress, should be doing everything it can to bring 
the hostages home, including working through allies and partners, and, 
to be sure, Qatar's mediation with Hamas's leaders has helped free some 
hostages, but at what cost and to what end?
  In exchange for the release of innocent women and children who were 
kidnapped by Hamas, Israel was forced to exchange three Palestinian 
prisoners for every one innocent Israeli victim. Many, if not all, of 
these prisoners were arrested, charged, and sentenced for stabbings, 
attempted car bombings, and other heinous crimes as part of the 
campaign of terror. Some have already returned to the fight, donning 
the infamous Hamas headband and calling for the slaughter of more 
Jewish people.
  Every day that goes by without a resolution to the hostage crisis 
exposes Qatar's decision to host Hamas as both foolish and flawed.
  Earlier this month, I met with the Qatari Ambassador in my office. I 
told him in no uncertain terms that his government must pressure Hamas 
leaders living in Doha to immediately and unconditionally release all 
hostages.
  In the nearly 2 months after Hamas's horrific October 7 massacre, 
however, we need to recognize that Qatar's current approach, while 
yielding limited successes, is attempting to do something unacceptable, 
and that is to legitimize Hamas.
  Simply put, there is no future for Gaza or the Palestinians that 
includes Hamas. In the past 2 months, we have watched Hamas leaders use 
Qatar's hospitality to buy time--prolonging the war and the hostage 
crisis from the comfort of their luxury accommodations. While 
Palestinians suffer in Gaza because of the war that Hamas started, we 
have seen Hamas leaders push their genocidal agenda from Doha, 
including in multiple meetings with Iran's Foreign Minister and even in 
a visit to Moscow. If Qatar's leadership believes that any of this is 
consistent with what Washington has asked of them, it is not.
  So my message to the Qatari Government is very simple: Stop this now. 
You are hosting a brutal terrorist organization with American blood on 
its hands and who is holding American hostages. Your media 
organizations, starting with Al Jazeera, are regularly pushing out 
Hamas's propaganda that only further inflames tensions in the Middle 
East. Your leadership continues to speak out of both sides of its 
mouth--on one hand, committing to negotiate a resolution to the hostage 
crisis while, on the other, blaming Israel and absolving Hamas at every 
turn.

  We need to tell our friends in Doha loudly and clearly: Qatar is 
accepting a significant liability with its pro-Hamas policy.
  So we must end this myth that this policy is something that 
Washington wants and urge the Qatari Government to end this policy 
immediately.
  This is personal for Americans, and I have met with the families of 
hostages right here in Washington. I have heard their stories. I look 
at their photos every day on my desk. Every day that these families 
have to live with the pain and uncertainty is unacceptable. We must 
stand united and say: Not one more day.
  We must also start thinking about the day after because there will 
come a day when Israel will halt its military operations in Gaza 
because they will have achieved their stated goal of destroying Hamas. 
The remaining question will then be what to do with the Hamas leaders 
in Doha. My view is that they should be extradited to the United States 
so that these terrorists can face justice in a U.S. court of law for 
killing and kidnapping American citizens.
  I would hope that our friends in Qatar will not only be partners for 
peace and stability but will also be partners in ensuring that Hamas 
and its leaders are brought to justice for the despicable acts of 
terror they have committed.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.;  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, so far--so far--the United States is 
standing behind Israel, as it should, in Israel's fight against Hamas--
so far.
  Don't go wobbly on us, President Biden. Don't go wobbly on Israel.
  But some people in Washington seem confused as to why America backs 
Israel. I am seeing a lot of hand-wringing from folks who like to 
pretend that there is some kind of--they use this word a lot: 
``nuance''--that there is some kind of nuance we need to apply to the 
Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7 before we can condemn Hamas and 
hold its supporters accountable. President Obama has even suggested 
that somehow we are all complicit in the bloodshed.
  Some people promoting this idea of nuance, frankly, believe that 
Israel got what it deserves. Now, they don't say that, but that is what 
they believe. They believe that Israel got what it deserved. These 
folks who believe that also apparently believe in diversity, equity, 
inclusion, and the right to kill Jews.
  Thankfully, that is not most Americans. That is a lot of people here 
in Washington, DC.
  In Louisiana, however, my State, we understand that the debased 
people who slaughtered hundreds of young people at a peace concert are 
the bad guys. In Louisiana, we understand that the odious men who raped 
women, raped and sodomized women next to the bodies of their dead 
friends, don't deserve to be on this planet. We in Louisiana understand 
that the degenerates--the degenerates--who forced kidnapped Holocaust 
survivors to pose for photos--to pose for photos, for God's sake--next 
to their terrorist captors are just wrong.
  Nothing--nothing--that the Israeli Government has ever done or could 
do warranted throwing grenades at children hiding in a bomb shelter. 
Why are some people reluctant to admit that?
  You don't need to read a treatise on the Middle East to know that 
only monsters--monsters with black hearts--would put a baby in an oven 
and flip on the switch, as one first responder reported. That is not 
nuance; that is evil.
  The evil we saw unfold when Hamas butchered Israeli civilians is 
indefensible. It is indefensible. Those terrorists brutalized thousands 
of people, including dozens of our American friends and neighbors. 
Hearing the stories from the survivors and from the first responders--
it is nauseating. It is not nuance; it is evil.
  Yet the Hamas terrorists took joy, they yelped for joy, as they 
massacred civilians. One terrorist called his mom--called his mother--
to brag that he had ``killed 10 Jews with my own hands.'' Who would 
brag about something like that? Another Hamas official celebrated the 
violence and vowed to continue to wage attacks like this ``again and 
again and again'' until Israel no longer exists.
  No family in Israel will be able to sleep soundly at night until 
these terrorists are wiped off the face of the Earth.
  Israel has both the right and it has the responsibility to defend 
itself. I am proud that the United States of America is supporting 
Israel.
  Don't go wobbly on us, President Biden. Stand your ground. Don't go 
wobbly.
  I am proud that the United States is supporting Israel. The world 
will be a safer place for Israelis and Americans alike when Hamas 
ceases to exist.
  Hamas leaders told anyone who would listen--anyone who would listen--
they told us exactly what they intended to do and wanted to do and will 
continue to do. They told anyone who would listen that their goal is to 
kill as many Jewish people as possible, and that is still their goal.
  This wasn't a protest against Israel's Government; it was a massacre 
of Jewish people--the largest since the Holocaust.

[[Page S5629]]

  It is not surprising, then, that some who oppose intervention in Gaza 
have turned to attacking Jewish Americans.
  In New York City, those people cornered Jewish students in a library, 
forcing a librarian to offer to hide the students in an attic. At 
Cornell University, they threatened to shoot up the kosher dining hall. 
At my State's Tulane University, activists broke a student's nose 
because he opposed their anti-Israel demonstration.
  These protests didn't occur in New York City or Cornell or Tulane by 
accident; they targeted these areas because they are home to many 
Americans who happen to be Jewish. That is just a fact. New York is 
home to the largest Jewish population outside of Israel. Tulane, in my 
State, which was the first university in the South to welcome Jewish 
students, has a student body today that is roughly 40 percent Jewish. 
It was no accident.
  When confused activists twist themselves in knots trying to justify 
the torture and the rape and the killing of Jews in the Middle East, 
they are feeding the fires of anti-Semitism here at home as well. 
Unfortunately, we have seen that over the past few weeks.
  Let's not forget--it is Hamas who is using civilians as human 
shields. Hamas is the group also hoarding fuel and food as Palestinian 
civilians starve. Hamas is the group that dug up water pipes to turn 
them into rocket launchers.
  The truth is that the Palestine people, the people of Gaza, and the 
Israeli people all suffer because of Hamas, and any suggestion that 
Israel is culpable for this suffering plays into the hands of the 
terrorists.
  In Louisiana, we can see through the pseudo-intellectual hand-
wringing of Israel's critics. The truth is that Hamas brutalized 
Israeli citizens and then ran home to hide behind their women and 
children, using those women and children as human shields. They are the 
lowest kind of pond scum, the lowest kind of sadists imaginable.
  Over the past week, Hamas has released some hostages as part of a 
temporary cease-fire. I am happy for that, and the American people are 
happy for that. I and they hope that every hostage will be reunited 
with their family soon. We cannot forget, however--we should not 
forget, however--that Hamas vowed to continue attacking and kidnapping 
Israeli citizens again and again and again, and the only way to stop 
this cycle is to eliminate Hamas.
  I was out of the country, in another country, when Hamas attacked 
Israel, and I did not know what position President Biden would take. I 
didn't. He said: I am standing with Israel. I was so relieved.
  I know President Biden is under a lot of pressure from the loon wing 
of his party to abandon Israel, to demand a permanent cease-fire, to 
let Hamas go unpunished. But Hamas doesn't want a permanent cease-fire. 
Hamas had a permanent cease-fire on October 6, the day before they 
attacked Israeli civilians, and Hamas forfeited that cease-fire 
unilaterally.
  Here is what Hamas wants: Hamas wants to terrorize Israel until all 
of the Jewish people are dead. Hamas wants to terrorize Israel until 
all of the Jewish people are dead. Hamas wants to kill Jews. Hamas 
wants to kill Jews and drink their blood out of a boot.
  That is not nuance, President Obama; that is evil.
  President Biden needs to show the world--and, frankly, some members 
of his own party--that the United States of America and its good people 
will continue to stand with Israel until Hamas is in ruins, until Hamas 
is dead and we drink their blood out of a boot, until Hamas's genocidal 
agenda is abandoned.
  The world will be safer on that day, and it will certainly be safer 
because Hamas is not in it. By supporting Israel's efforts, Americans 
are helping to ensure that an attack like October 7 never happens 
again, and I think most fairminded Americans understand that.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Padilla). The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered."

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 888) reaffirming the State of Israel's right to 
exist.
  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.
  The text of the resolution is as follows:

                              H. Res. 888

       Whereas the Jewish people are native to the Land of Israel;
       Whereas throughout history and across the reign of multiple 
     kingdoms, the Jewish people were persecuted and expelled from 
     the Land of Israel, forced to live as minority diaspora 
     communities in other lands;
       Whereas Jewish diaspora communities were historically 
     violently persecuted in, and in some cases expelled from, 
     other countries throughout the Middle East, Europe, Africa, 
     and Asia due to their religion;
       Whereas the Nazis attempted to annihilate the entire Jewish 
     population of Europe during the Holocaust, murdering 
     6,000,000 Jews during this time;
       Whereas this genocide provided new urgency to re-establish 
     a Jewish homeland for the Jewish people following the 
     Holocaust, where they would not be a vulnerable minority, 
     where they could freely practice their faith, and where 
     something like the Holocaust could never happen again;
       Whereas the modern State of Israel was established on May 
     14, 1948;
       Whereas even after the establishment of the State of 
     Israel, other countries and terrorist entities continued to 
     attack Israel, reject its right to exist, and call for its 
     destruction; and
       Whereas Israel is the only Jewish State, and therefore, 
     despite persistent external threats, the existence of Israel 
     provides Jews a place to live free from persecution and 
     discrimination: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
       (1) reaffirms the State of Israel's right to exist;
       (2) recognizes that denying Israel's right to exist is a 
     form of antisemitism;
       (3) rejects calls for Israel's destruction and the 
     elimination of the only Jewish State; and
       (4) condemns the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Lawler) and the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Manning) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.


                             General Leave

  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members

[[Page H5924]]

may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New York?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge the House to agree to my resolution 
that reaffirms Israel's fundamental right to exist.
  This is a pretty simple and straightforward resolution. Israel has a 
right to exist. You either believe that or you don't. The American 
people should see very clearly whether or not the Members of Congress 
affirm Israel's right to exist.
  President Harry Truman recognized Israel 11 minutes after its 
founding. America was the first country to recognize the State of 
Israel, and for good reason.
  Over the last 75 years, Israel has become the greatest ally of the 
United States--our shared values, shared heritage. The relationship 
between our two Nations is unbreakable.
  I fundamentally believe that the terrorist attacks of October 7 
perpetrated by Hamas are about one thing: Hamas does not believe Israel 
has the right to exist. Hamas wants to eradicate the Jewish people from 
the face of the Earth. They say so.
  Other bad actors like Hezbollah share that perspective. Iran, the 
greatest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, the backer and funder 
of Hamas, has been calling for the eradication of the State of Israel 
for millennia. They don't believe they have the right to exist.
  This resolution seeks to reaffirm the commitment made by President 
Truman upon Israel's founding. We not only recognize Israel, we 
reaffirm Israel's fundamental right to exist.
  In the wake of the horrific October 7 attacks on Israel, we saw 
Members of this body and other opponents of Israel call for the 
elimination of Israel. When they chant: ``From the river to the sea, 
Palestine shall be free,'' they mean that Israel will not exist.
  I want Palestinians to be free. I want them to be free from their 
oppressors: Hamas and the Palestinian authority.
  Hamas has used Palestinians as human shields even until today. As 
Israel prosecutes this war against this terrorist organization, Hamas 
uses Palestinians as human shields, camping out in hospitals and 
schools, launching missiles, shooting innocent civilians.
  I watched in horror the 21-minute unedited, raw footage of the 
October 7 terrorist attack. Every Member of Congress was offered the 
opportunity to watch a 45-minute viewing of that attack.
  Nearly half of Congress chose not to come, including some of the 
Members who have made it clear that they don't support Israel's right 
to exist.

                              {time}  1800

  On college campuses and city streets, we see people calling for an 
intifada, actively promoting the destruction of the Jewish state. 
Everyone has a right to say what they want about a foreign government, 
to say what they want about war, but they don't have the right to 
delegitimize the very existence of the Jewish state to justify terror.
  The State of Israel was created 75 years ago to reestablish the 
native homeland of the Jewish people. For centuries, Jews were 
discriminated against and persecuted wherever they went. This 
culminated in the attempted genocide of European Jews during the 
Holocaust; 6 million Jews slaughtered.
  This most recent genocide provides new urgency to reestablish the 
Jewish homeland where the Jewish people were displaced, and we wanted 
to create a homeland where they weren't a vulnerable minority, where 
they could freely practice their faith, and where something like the 
Holocaust could never happen again.
  Yet, on October 7, we saw the largest slaughtering of Jews since the 
Holocaust. Yet, still today, many Jews view Israel as the safest place 
for them to live, even as rockets and missiles come from all sides.
  Denying Israel's right to exist is denying the Jewish people the 
right to self-determination. It is denying the Jewish people's historic 
ties to the land. It is justifying war crimes against babies, and let's 
call it what it is, it is anti-Semitic.
  I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense resolution 
that makes one thing fundamentally clear: Israel has a right to exist. 
Congress must never stop pushing back against Israel's opponents, and 
we must reject biased attempts to destroy our greatest ally.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 888 introduced by my 
friends, Representatives Mike Lawler and Jared Moskowitz.
  Mr. Speaker, on many occasions this House of Representatives has 
reaffirmed Israel's right to exist, and it is important that we do so 
again today. It is incomprehensible to me that after Hamas' horrific 
terrorist attack on October 7, the largest attack on the Jewish people 
since the Holocaust, we are seeing a growing wave of anti-Semitism rear 
its ugly head at home and around the world.
  Since Israel's independence in 1948 and its admission into the United 
Nations the following year, international law has mandated Israel's 
right to exist. Yet, as of this year, 28 of the 193 United Nation 
member states still do not recognize Israeli sovereignty.
  The terrorist organization, Hamas, has declared that Israel has no 
right to exist and for decades has targeted Israel for destruction with 
suicide bombs, with missiles and rockets, and most recently, with 
gruesome and savage terror attacks targeting civilians.
  The destruction of Israel and the killing of Jews is Hamas' sole 
focus. They have murdered babies, raped women, executed parents in 
front of their children, and massacred 260 young people at a music 
festival. They have taken 250 innocent civilians, including American 
citizens, hostage.
  They are not working to help the Palestinian people who elected them. 
Indeed, the Palestinian people are shamelessly used and abused by Hamas 
as human shields.
  As a proud, lifelong supporter of a two-state solution, I know that 
with Hamas in control of 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, real progress 
on a two-state solution cannot being achieved. Hamas has always only 
ever played spoiler. The same is true of Iran's other regional proxies, 
Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and others, who also exist only 
to destabilize and destroy Israel, not to strive for a two-state 
solution.
  There cannot be peace when a party to a conflict doesn't recognize 
the other parties' right to exist. With recognition comes peace and 
mutual prosperity, security, and innovation. That is why efforts to 
facilitate and expand the Abraham Accords are so historic and 
important. The Abraham Accords countries, along with Egypt and Jordan, 
all recognize this fact and are advancing their nations in the spirit 
of regional cooperation and peace.
  Here at home, whether it is on public streets, on college campuses, 
or online, we have seen a deeply disturbing and aggressive increase and 
despicable call for Israel to cease existing as a Jewish State.
  The phrase, ``from the river to the sea,'' a sickening call for the 
destruction of the State of Israel and the genocide of the Jewish 
people, has become a rallying cry for those hoping for Israel's 
destruction. Calling for total Palestinian control of all Israeli 
territory from the River Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea is a call to 
eliminate the Jewish State of Israel.
  This resolution states that denying Israel's right to exist is a form 
of anti-Semitism. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. To be 
clear, it is not necessarily anti-Semitic to criticize the State of 
Israel or its leaders for particular policies. That is free speech, and 
no country is above criticism for its policies, including our own. It 
is absolutely anti-Semitic to treat Israel as a pariah based on the 
claim that Jews alone should be denied the right to define themselves 
as a people and to exercise any form of national self-determination.
  This is the crucial difference. It is anti-Semitism, and we must 
totally reject it.
  In 2015, former President Barack Obama stated the following in an 
interview: I think it would be a moral failing for me as President of 
the United

[[Page H5925]]

States, a moral failing for America, and a moral failing for the world 
if we did not protect Israel and stand up for its right to exist, 
because that would negate not just the history of the 20th century, it 
would negate the history of the past millennium.
  Mr. Speaker, I totally agree with that statement. For thousands of 
years, Jews have suffered persecution and lack the safety and stability 
of a homeland. Today, the modern Jewish State of Israel thrives in the 
ancient Jewish Holy Land where it is a robust democracy and productive 
and treasured member of the international community of nations.

  Israel has signed peace treaties with two of its most important 
neighbors and has come to the table for many rounds of peace 
negotiations with the Palestinians. Israel is a country that wants 
peace, whereas Hamas and its Iranian patron do not.
  Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people and will always remain a 
place of refuge where Jews can be truly safe and control their own 
destiny. Israel is certainly worthy of the support of this House and 
the United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on 
Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations.
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 888 reaffirming the 
State of Israel's right to exist.
  I thank my good friend from New York, Mike Lawler, for introducing 
this timely, extremely important, and ever-necessary resolution.
  Mr. Speaker, Israel is the only state in the world whose fundamental 
right to exist is openly denied by other states. Some of them, 
including Iran, even call for Israel's complete destruction and support 
transnational terrorist organizations to work toward its demise.
  It is also the only state in the world whose fundamental right to 
exist is constantly undermined and challenged by intergovernmental 
organizations, such as and most shamefully of all, the United Nations.
  The anti-Semitism motivating those who deny Israel's right to exist 
is apparent, but it is important to connect, as this resolution does, 
the denial of Israel's right to exist, to anti-Semitism, and to connect 
them both as enabling causes to the monstrous crimes Hamas has 
unleashed on Israel.
  Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitic bigotry is at the root of 
the U.N.'s hostility toward Israel, which is ugly, evil, and manifests 
itself at almost every U.N. entity.
  On November 8, I chaired a hearing of my subcommittee, and we called 
it United Nations' Bigotry Towards Israel.
  We heard expert testimony from Hillel Neuer, the executive director 
of U.N. Watch; and Jonathan Schanzer, the senior vice president for 
research at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.
  Hillel Neuer testified: ``Teachers and schools at the U.N. Relief and 
Works Agency, which runs education and social services for 
Palestinians, regularly call to murder Jews, and create teaching 
materials that glorify terrorism, encourage martyrdom, demonize 
Israelis, and incite anti-Semitism.''
  He further said: ``In 2022 alone, UNRWA received $344 million in U.S. 
funding. Yet, a March 2023 report by U.N. Watch and Impact-SE 
identified 133 UNRWA educators and staff who were found to promote hate 
and violence on social media, and an additional 82 teachers and other 
staff affiliated with 30 UNRWA schools who were involved in drafting 
and distributing hateful content to their students.''
  That is just the tip of the iceberg.
  Jonathan Schanzer testified that: ``The U.N. doesn't recognize Hamas 
as a terrorist organization. Nor does it recognize Hezbollah either. 
That means U.N. resources can be and regularly are provided to members 
of those terrorist groups.''
  Mr. Speaker, according to the great human rights defender, Nathan 
Sharansky's famous 3-D test for anti-Semitism, which he articulated at 
a hearing that I chaired way back in 2004, criticism of Israel is 
nothing less than anti-Semitic when it passes over into the 
demonization of Jews and Israel, delegitimizes the Jewish state, or 
applies double standards; that is, one standard for Israel, and another 
for every other country on Earth.
  That is what many U.N. entities and agencies do every single day.
  Yesterday, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, the JTA, reported on the 
latest example of the double standard and said: ``Nearly 50 days after 
Hamas' attack on Israel left 1,200 dead, and after weeks of criticism 
over its silence about allegations of sexual violence during the 
attack, the women's rights group, U.N. Women, issued a statement 
condemning the terror group on Friday.
  Then it deleted the post.''
  Here is what it said originally:
  `` `We condemn the brutal attack by Hamas on October 7 and continue 
to call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages,' 
read the initial statement posted on U.N. Women's Instagram page.
  It was soon replaced with a statement that dropped the condemnation 
of Hamas and only called for the release of hostages.''
  Mr. Speaker, there are so many examples.
  In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly targeted Israel in a total of 15 
harshly critical resolutions, compared to 13 country-specific 
resolutions for the entire world: China, North Korea, Iran; 13 for all 
of them combined, 15 for Israel.
  In large measure, it is because of the U.N., which unquestionably is 
the world's foremost legitimizer of anti-Semitism, that it remains 
necessary, 75 years after the founding of the great State of Israel, to 
reaffirm its right to exist.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague from New York, and 
my friend from Florida, for authoring this important resolution.

                              {time}  1815

  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Moskowitz).
  Mr. MOSKOWITZ. Mr. Speaker, Israel has a right to exist. There are 
only two ways to vote on this. Either you vote ``yes'' or you vote 
``no.'' ``No'' means you do not believe Israel should be a country. 
``No'' means you believe a country should be wiped off the face of the 
Earth. A ``present'' vote means you do not believe Israel should be a 
country. Hanging out in the cloakroom, having a hot dog, or missing the 
vote means Israel shouldn't be a country.
  This is a moment for people in this body, on a bipartisan basis, to 
stand together and say they believe Israel has a right to exist.
  Hamas doesn't think Israel has a right to exist. Hezbollah doesn't 
think Israel has a right to exist. Iran doesn't think Israel has a 
right to exist. People who vote ``no'' or vote ``present'' side with 
them. They pick a side with Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran.
  I don't want to hear excuses. ``Oh, I didn't like this `whereas' 
clause,'' or, ``Oh, there was a period or a comma out of place,'' as if 
somehow we always vote on perfect resolutions around here. Again, it is 
an opportunity to show the world that we believe Israel has a right to 
exist.
  We see anti-Semitism in the streets and at rallies. At cease-fire 
rallies, which is a foreign policy position, we see people holding 
signs that say: ``Gas the Jews,'' ``Kill the Jews,'' and ``Cleanse the 
Jews.'' That is not a foreign policy. If it is, it is a foreign policy 
of Germany in the early 1940s.
  This is a moment for people in this body, some of whom sit in the 
rows behind me, to show they believe Israel has a right to exist.
  I am for a two-state solution, Mr. Speaker. I think it is important 
that the Palestinian people get a state. But rest assured, in that two-
state solution, one of those states is going to be Israel.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Florida.
  Mr. MOSKOWITZ. Mr. Speaker, I conclude with this: Anyone who believes 
that Israel doesn't have a right to exist is calling for genocide. We 
hear that word thrown around a lot now on

[[Page H5926]]

social media, ``genocide.'' We have a war in the Middle East. We don't 
have genocide.
  If you believe a country should not exist, the millions of people in 
that country should also not exist, which means you are calling for 
genocide.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote ``yes'' on this resolution. 
Israel has a right to exist.
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. Amo), the newest member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee.
  Mr. AMO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to affirm our ally Israel's right to 
exist.
  The unprovoked October 7 attack by Hamas has left a deep wound. 
Israel has a right to defend itself against this barbarism consistent 
with international humanitarian law, including the protection of 
civilians.
  Far too many Israeli families do not know the fate of their loved 
ones at the hands of Hamas. While some have relief, there are still 
many who need to be reunited with their families. My hope is that the 
success President Biden has had will secure the release of all the 
hostages.
  Importantly, the extended pause has meant additional humanitarian 
assistance to alleviate the suffering of the innocent Palestinian 
families in Gaza for whom Hamas has no regard. There must be sustained 
and safe access to food, water, and medical care.
  Paramount is the prevention of this conflict from spreading, 
preserving stability in the Middle East, and working toward a durable 
peace.
  These events have brought forward a rise in anti-Semitism and 
Islamophobia. Anti-Semitic incidents have involved violent assaults on 
Jewish students on college campuses and protesters extolling terrorist 
organizations.
  Close to home, I was especially horrified that this past weekend, 
three students of Palestinian descent, one a Brown University student, 
were shot. I pray for their recovery and that the assailant be brought 
to justice.
  This crisis of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia demands an urgent and 
collective response. There is no place for violence or hate in America.
  In recognition of Israel's right to exist and for the immediate 
release of hostages taken during the October 7 attack, I urge my 
colleagues to support H. Res. 888 and H. Res. 793.
  Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume 
for the purpose of closing.
  Mr. Speaker, the Jewish people have connections to the State of 
Israel that go back thousands of years. Indeed, the Jewish people are 
indigenous to that land.
  Yes, Israel has a right to exist. This multicultural, multiethnic, 
multireligious nation, a nation of laws, a nation with free speech and 
free press, a nation of innovation, and a vibrant, thriving democracy, 
an incredible country, has much to teach the world and will continue to 
do so. This country, our only democratic ally in the Middle East, is 
here to stay.
  This resolution puts the House of Representatives on record as 
affirming the State of Israel's right to exist. It recognizes that 
denying Israel's right to exist is a form of anti-Semitism. It rejects 
calls for Israel's destruction and the elimination of the only Jewish 
state and condemns the October 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack on the 
State of Israel and its people.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution, and I urge all my 
colleagues to do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing.
  It should be clear by now to each and every Member of this body on 
both sides of the aisle and every American that Israel has a right to 
exist. This sentiment is unequivocal and is a critical point to 
unequivocally voice now in our ally's time of need.
  Harry Truman recognized the State of Israel 11 minutes after its 
founding. For 75 years, the United States and Israel have had a special 
bond. Israel is the only multiracial, multiethnic, multireligious 
democracy in the Middle East. It is a beacon of hope, of freedom, and 
of opportunity.
  If anyone in this body believes that they do not have the right to 
exist, please explain to us and the American people what nation does.
  This is a simple vote, and every Member should be on record in 
support of Israel's right to exist. If they cannot muster the courage 
to support Israel's right to exist at this moment, they don't belong in 
Congress, period.
  This is a simple vote, and I encourage all of my colleagues to stand 
with Israel, to defend and reaffirm their very right to exist, and to 
defend the right of the Jewish people to practice their faith.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler) that the House suspend the rules 
and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 888.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

Mr. President, today, I come to the floor to speak on a 
subject of great importance--the rise of anti-Semitism in America.
  I feel compelled to speak because I am the highest ranking Jewish 
elected official in America--in fact, the highest ranking Jewish 
elected official ever in American history--and I have noticed a 
significant disparity between how Jewish people regard the rise of 
anti-Semitism and how many of my non-Jewish friends regard it. To us, 
the Jewish people, the rise of anti-Semitism is a crisis--a five-alarm 
fire that must be extinguished. For so many other people of good will, 
it is merely a problem, a matter of concern. So, today, I want to use 
my platform to explain why so many Jewish people see this problem as a 
crisis.
  Before I get into that, I want to offer two important caveats about 
what this speech is not.
  This speech is not an attempt to label most criticism of Israel and 
the Israeli Government, generally, as anti-Semitic. I don't believe 
that criticism is. And this speech is also not an attempt to pit hate 
toward one group against that of another. I believe that bigotry 
against one group of Americans is bigotry against all, and that is why 
I have championed legislation, like the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which 
targets violence against Asian Americans, and the Nonprofit Security 
Grant Program, which provides funding to help all houses of worship--
churches, mosques, synagogues, gurdwaras--and to protect them from 
extremists.
  When President Trump called for a Muslim ban during the first weeks 
of his Presidency, I held an emergency press conference to protest the 
ban alongside a Muslim mom and four of her daughters--all dressed in 
chadors--who said they feared they might never see their father again. 
It was a deeply distressing moment, and I am an emotional sort. I began 
to cry. President Trump saw me crying on TV and gave me a nickname--
``Cryin' Chuck Schumer.'' I was and am proud of that moniker.
  The growing and vibrant Arab-American community is a vital part of 
our Nation and of my city, and I condemn unequivocally any vitriol and 
hatred against them. We tragically saw where such hatred can lead 
sometimes--in Vermont this week--and that is unacceptable.

[[Page S5644]]

  But, today, I want to focus my remarks on anti-Semitism because it 
hits so close to home for me and because I believe this moment demands 
it.
  I have just said what this speech is not. So what is this speech 
about?
  I want to describe the fears and anxieties of many Jewish Americans 
right now, particularly after October 7, who feel there are aspects of 
the debate around Israel and Gaza that are crossing over into anti-
Semitism--rank anti-Semitism, with Jewish people simply being targeted 
for being Jewish--having nothing to do with Israel. I want to explain 
through the lens of history why this is so dangerous. The normalization 
and exacerbation of this rise in hate is the danger many Jewish people 
fear most. And, finally, I want to suggest how and why I hope that all 
Americans of good will can come together and do a better job of 
condemning such views and such behavior. But, first, let us establish 
the facts.

  There is no question that anti-Semitism is a serious problem in 
America. In general, Jewish Americans represent 2 percent of the U.S. 
population. Yet we are the targets of 55 percent of all religion-based 
hate crimes reported by the FBI. This problem has been steadily 
worsening in recent years, but after Hamas attacked Israel on October 
7, hate crimes against Jewish Americans have skyrocketed. The Anti-
Defamation League estimates that anti-Semitic incidents have increased 
nearly 300 percent since October 7. The NYPD has recorded a 214-percent 
increase in New York City.
  After October 7, Jewish Americans are feeling singled out, targeted, 
and isolated. In many ways, we feel alone. The solidarity that Jewish 
Americans initially received from many of our fellow citizens was 
quickly drowned out by other voices.
  While the dead bodies of Jewish Israelis were still warm, while 
hundreds of Jewish Israelis were being carried as hostages back to 
Hamas tunnels under Gaza, Jewish Americans were alarmed to see some of 
our fellow citizens characterize a brutal terrorist attack as justified 
because of the actions of the Israeli Government. A vicious, blood-
curdling, premeditated massacre of innocent women, men, children, the 
elderly--justified. Even worse, in some cases, people even celebrated 
what happened, describing it as the deserved fate of colonizers and 
calling for glory to the martyrs who carried out these heinous attacks. 
That happened here in America.
  Many of the people who express these sentiments in America aren't 
neo-Nazis or card-carrying Klan members or Islamist extremists. They 
are, in many cases, people who most liberal Jewish Americans felt 
previously were their ideological fellow travelers. Not long ago, many 
of us marched together for Black and Brown lives; we stood against 
anti-Asian hatred; we protested bigotry against the LGBTQ community; we 
fought for reproductive justice--out of the recognition that injustice 
against one oppressed group is injustice against all.
  But, apparently, in the eyes of some, this principle does not extend 
to the Jewish people: the largely Ashkenazi survivors of decades of 
pogroms in Imperial Russia and, in the Holocaust under Nazi Germany, 
their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren; the Mizrahi, 
who were forcibly evicted from Arab countries, and their descendants; 
the many Sephardim, who were scattered across the Mediterranean after 
they were expelled from Spain and Portugal in the late 1400s.
  Do they not deserve the solidarity of those who advocate for the 
rights and dignity of the oppressed, given the long history and 
persecution of the Jewish people throughout the world?
  Many of those protesting Israeli policy note that at least 700,000 
Palestinians were displaced or forced from their homes in 1948, but 
they never mention the 600,000 Mizrahi Jews across the Arab world who 
were also displaced, whose property was confiscated, whose lives were 
threatened, who were expelled from their communities.
  The hope, at the time, was that there would be two states--a Jewish 
state and a Palestinian state--living side by side. The plan was for 
the State of Israel to absorb the Jewish people from Arab lands and the 
new Palestinian State to absorb the Palestinians who now lived in 
Israel. In fact, Israel did absorb the displaced Jewish people of Arab 
lands, but the Arab nations, instead, sanctioned the United Nations to 
set up refugee camps for the Palestinians, refusing to accept the 
possibility that any of them would ever be relocated.
  Several times throughout history, Israeli Prime Ministers called for 
a return to close to the pre-1967 borders established by the United 
Nations plan. Those calls were rejected by Yasser Arafat, the PLO, and 
the wider Arab community. Many, if not most, Jewish Americans, 
including myself, supported a two-state solution. We disagreed with 
Prime Minister Netanyahu and his administration's encouragement of 
militant settlers in the West Bank, which has become a considerable 
obstacle to a two-state solution.
  But the reason why I invoke history about the founding of the Israeli 
State is because forgetting or even deliberately ignoring this vital 
context is dangerous. Some of the most extreme rhetoric against Israel 
has emboldened anti-Semites who are attacking Jewish people simply 
because they are Jewish--independent of anything having to do with 
Israel.
  Those who are inclined to examine the world through the lens of 
oppressors versus the oppressed should take note that the many 
thousands of years of Jewish history are defined by oppression. From 
October 7, 2023, in southern Israel; to 2018 at the Tree of Life 
Synagogue in Pittsburgh; to 1999 at the Los Angeles JCC; to 1986 at the 
Neve Shalom Synagogue in Istanbul; to 1974 at the Netiv Meir Elementary 
School in Ma'alot; to Yom Kippur, 1973, in the Golan Heights; to 1972 
at the Munich Olympics and Lod Airport; to 1967 at the Straits of 
Tiran; to the 1940s and 1930s in Germany and Central Europe; to the 
1800s in the Pale of Settlement; to 1679 in Yemen; to 1492 in Spain, 
1394 in France, 1290 in England; to the Crusades of the Middle Ages; to 
629 in Galilee; to the year 73 in Jerusalem; to 586 B.C. in Judea; to 
722 B.C.E. in Samaria; to the 13th century B.C.E. in Egypt, the Jewish 
people have been humiliated, ostracized, expelled, enslaved, and 
massacred for millennia.
  To paraphrase lines recited every year, century after century, at 
Passover Seder: This is the bread of affliction that our forefathers 
ate in the land of Egypt. . . . In every generation, they rise up to 
destroy us.
  For Jewish people all across the world, the history of our trauma, 
going back many generations, is central to any discussion about our 
future. Too many Americans, especially in our younger generation, don't 
have a full understanding of this history. Because some Jewish people 
have done well in America, because Israel has increased its power and 
territory, there are people who feel that Jewish Americans are not 
vulnerable; that we have the strength and security to overcome 
prejudice and bigotry; that we have, to quote the language of some, 
become the ``oppressors.'' In fact, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories 
throughout the generations often theorize, often weaponize this very 
dynamic by pitting what successes the Jewish people have achieved 
against them and against their fellow countrymen. That has been 
throughout history. It is happening now.
  But for many Jewish Americans, any strength and security that we 
enjoy always feels tenuous. No matter how well we are doing, it can all 
be taken away in an instant. That is just how it is. We only have to 
look back a century, a few generations, to see how this can happen.
  Growing up, I remember my grandfather telling me that he rooted for 
Germany over Russia in World War I because Germans treated the Jewish 
people so much better than Russia did.
  In the early 1900s, German Jews were one of the most secure and 
prosperous ethnic communities in Europe, but in the span of a decade, 
all of that changed.
  When the Nazis first marched in the streets and held rallies decrying 
the so-called international financiers, war profiteers, and communists, 
many Germans of good will either stayed silent or marched alongside of 
them, not necessarily realizing what they were aiding and abetting. But 
when Adolf Hitler took the podium just a few years later at the 
Reichstag, it was clear by

[[Page S5645]]

then that the terms ``international financiers,'' ``war profiteers,'' 
and ``communists'' represented the Jewish people, whom Hitler called 
``parasites'' feeding on the body and productive work of other nations.
  By bits and pieces, the Nazis softened the ground rhetorically for 
what Hitler eventually stated was his true goal: ``the annihilation of 
the Jewish race in Europe.'' So many of those Germans of good will who 
marched in the early years of Hitler's ascension stayed on the 
sidelines after his horrifying intent was made clear. The end result, 
as we all know, was the most targeted and systematic genocide in all of 
human history. Six million Jewish people were exterminated in a few 
years while so many others turned a blind eye.
  History shows that anti-Semitism is deeply embedded in Europe. I have 
always said it is the poison of European societies--anti-Semitism is 
the poison of European societies, just as racism against Black 
Americans is the poison of our society.
  While we are thankfully a far ways away from Nazi Germany today, this 
is why many people worry about the marches today, especially in Europe. 
What may begin as legitimate criticism of Israeli policy or even a 
valid debate over other religious, economic, and political issues can 
sometimes cross into something darker: attacking Jewish people for 
simply being Jewish.
  Obviously, many of those marching here in the United States do not 
have any evil intent, but when Jewish people hear chants like ``from 
the river to the sea''--a founding slogan of Hamas, a terrorist group 
that is not shy about their goal to eradicate the Jewish people in 
Israel and around the globe--we are alarmed.
  When we see signs in the crowd that read ``by any means necessary'' 
after the most violent attack ever against Israeli civilians, we are 
appalled at the casual invocation of such savagery.
  When we see protesters at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade compare the 
genocide of the Holocaust equivalently to the Israeli army's actions to 
defeat Hamas in self-defense of their people, we are shocked.
  When we see many people and news organizations remain neutral about 
the basic absurdity of these claims and actions, we are deeply 
disappointed.
  More than anything, we are worried, quite naturally, given the twists 
and turns of history, about where these actions and sentiments could 
eventually lead. Now, this is no intellectual exercise for us. For many 
Jewish people, it is like a matter of survival, informed once again by 
history--in this case, very personal history to me.
  Take the story of my own family. My grandfather came to Ellis Island 
at a very young age from Eastern Europe without an education, without a 
penny to his name. He was a street urchin, stealing apples from the 
pushcarts just to survive, but he dreamt of a brighter future for 
himself and his family.
  My grandfather ended up with the paper workers in Utica, NY, and he 
helped form the union there. But he lost his job in the lead-up to 
World War II, so he came back to New York City and bought a little 
exterminating business.
  His son--my father--followed in his footsteps and eventually took 
over that exterminating business. My father struggled in that job, 
barely making ends meet, but together with my mom, he provided a stable 
and loving home in Brooklyn for my siblings and me, where we were able 
to flourish.
  Because of the tolerance and the openness and the opportunity that 
courses through all of American life, I now stand before you as the 
majority leader of the United States Senate--the highest elected office 
a Jewish person has ever attained in the history of this country. Only 
in America--only in America--could an exterminator's son grow up to be 
the first Jewish party leader in the Senate.
  But it must be said also that this is not the norm in the grand and 
long scheme of Jewish history. While my grandfather came to America and 
encountered opportunity, many of his siblings, cousins, aunts and 
uncles, and other family members remained behind in Eastern Europe.
  When I was still a young boy, I was told why many branches of our 
family tree stopped growing forever.
  In 1941, when the Nazis invaded Ukraine, then part of Galicia, they 
asked my great-grandmother--the matriarch of the family, the wife of a 
locally revered rabbi--to gather her children, her grandchildren, and 
her great-grandchildren on the porch of her home, which was located in 
the town square. As more than 30 people gathered on the porch, aged 85 
to 3 months, the Nazis forced the remaining Jewish citizens of the town 
to gather in the town square and watch.
  When the Nazis told my great-grandmother ``You are coming with us,'' 
she refused, and they machine-gunned down every last one of them--the 
babies, the elderly, everybody in between.
  This story resonated deeply in my heart when I first started learning 
the details of the October 7 massacre in Israel. I was in China with a 
bipartisan delegation of my fellow Senators trying to get President Xi 
Jinping to open up Chinese markets to American companies and stop the 
flow of fentanyl across our borders.
  As the horrors of October 7 started coming into focus, the Israeli 
Ambassador to China shared with me the story of what she heard had just 
happened in one of the kibbutzim called Be'eri. Hamas terrorists 
entered the kibbutz on October 7 and killed more than 120 Jewish 
residents, from the elderly to babies.
  Sadly, it was not the first time I heard of such evil being committed 
against the Jewish people. Most, if not all, Jewish Americans know 
stories similar to that of my family. Most, if not all, of us learned 
this story at a young age. It will be imprinted on our hearts for as 
long as we live.
  All Jewish Americans carry in them the scar tissue of this 
generational trauma, and that directly informs how we are experiencing 
and processing the rhetoric of today. We see and hear things 
differently from others because we are deeply sensitive to the 
depravation and horrors that can follow the targeting of Jewish people 
if it is not repudiated, which brings me back to today.
  While many protesters no doubt view their actions as a compassionate 
expression of solidarity with the Palestinian people, for many Jewish 
Americans, we feel in too many instances, some of the most extreme 
rhetoric gives license to darker ideas that have always lurked below 
the surface of every question involving the Jewish people. Anti-Semites 
have always trafficked in coded language and action to define Jewish 
people as unworthy of the rights and privileges afforded to other 
groups.
  I believe there are plenty of people who chant ``From the river to 
the sea, Palestine will be free'' not because they hate Jewish people 
but because they support a better future for Palestinians. But there is 
no question that Hamas and other terrorist organizations have used this 
slogan to represent their intention to eliminate Jewish people not only 
from Israel but from every corner of the Earth.
  Given the history of oppression, expulsion, and state violence that 
is practically embedded in Jewish DNA, can you blame the Jewish people 
for hearing a violently anti-Semitic message loud and clear anytime we 
hear that chant?
  We shouldn't accept this sort of language from anybody any more than 
we accept other racist dog whistles, like invoking ``welfare queens'' 
to criticize safety net programs or calling COVID-19 the ``Chinese 
virus.'' And that goes for extreme rightwing Jewish settlers who also 
use deplorable language and who don't believe there should be any 
Palestinians between the river and the sea.
  Anti-Semites are taking advantage of the pro-Palestinian movement to 
espouse hatred and bigotry toward Jewish people. But rather than call 
out this dangerous behavior for what it is, we see so many of our 
friends and fellow citizens, particularly young people who yearn for 
justice, unknowingly aiding and abetting their cause.
  Worse, many of our friends and allies whose support we need now more 
than ever during this moment of intense Jewish pain have brushed aside 
these concerns. Suddenly, they don't want to hear about anti-Semitism 
or the ultimate goal of Hamas. When I have asked some of the marchers 
what they would do about Hamas, they don't have an answer. Many don't 
seem to care. So Jewish Americans are left alone--at least in our 
eyes--to ponder what this all means and where it could lead.

[[Page S5646]]

  Can you understand why the Jewish people feel isolated when we hear 
some praise Hamas and chant its vicious slogan? Can you blame us for 
feeling vulnerable only 80 years after Hitler wiped out half the Jewish 
population across the world while so many countries turned their back? 
Can you appreciate the deep fear we have about what Hamas might do if 
left to their own devices? Because the long arc of Jewish history 
teaches us a lesson that is hard to forget: Ultimately, we are alone.
  As a teenager growing up halfway across the world from Israel in 
Brooklyn during the 1950s and 1960s, I remember this feeling of 
aloneness myself. When many of the world's airlines boycotted Israel so 
that they could maintain business with the Arab world, I admired Air 
France, as a little boy, because only they would fly to Israel. I 
preferred to drink Coca-Cola to Pepsi because Coca-Cola did business in 
Israel and refused to participate in a biased boycott. Later, I 
remember--in June of 1967--walking in solitary silence to class at 
Madison High School with a transistor radio held to my ear, listening 
to the news reports about the Six-Day War and praying to God that 
Israel would survive.
  On top of feeling alone, the second dominant feeling that Jewish 
people have endured throughout history has been the sting of the double 
standard, which is the way the world has practiced anti-Semitism over 
and over again.
  To the Jewish people, the double standard has been ever present and 
is at the root of anti-Semitism. The double standard is very simple: 
What is good for everybody is never good for the Jew. And when it comes 
time to assign blame for some problem, the Jew is always the first 
target. And in recent decades, this double standard has manifested 
itself in the way much of the world treats Israel differently than 
anybody else.
  The double standard was made clear to me when I was in college. I 
remember the day when the great and articulate Israeli Ambassador to 
the United Nations, Abba Eban, was invited to come lecture on campus 
while the Students for a Democratic Society and the Progressive Labor 
Party were waging a campaign against Israel's right to exist.
  Two thousand people gathered in the large auditorium to see 
Ambassador Eban, and the members of the SDS and PLP sat in the gallery 
and hung a banner saying ``Fight the Zionist Imperialists.''
  When the members of the SDS and PLP tried to shout him down, Eban 
pointed his finger to the protesters in the gallery, and with his 
Etonian inflection, he calmly but strongly delivered a statement I will 
never forget and that I will paraphrase now.
  He said: I am talking to you, up there in the gallery. Every time a 
people gets their statehood, you applaud them. The Nigerians, the 
Pakistanis, the Zambians--you applaud their getting statehood. There is 
only one people, when they gain statehood, you don't applaud--you 
condemn it--and that is the Jewish people.
  We Jews are used to that, he said. We have lived with a double 
standard throughout the centuries. There were always things the Jews 
couldn't do. Everyone could be a farmer but not the Jew. Everyone could 
be a carpenter but not the Jew, he said. Everyone could move to Moscow 
but not the Jew. And everyone can have their own state but not the Jew.
  There is a word for it, he said to them. That is anti-Semitism, and I 
accuse you in the gallery of it.
  And the protesters slinked off.
  This double standard persists in America today, and it is once again 
leaving Jewish people to feel isolated and alone.
  In the immediate aftermath of October 7, an attack on defenseless 
civilians--the elderly, women, babies--a good number of people skipped 
over expressing sympathy for its victims in their haste to blame the 
attack on the past actions of the Israeli Government.
  Can anyone imagine a horrific terrorist attack in another country 
receiving such a reception?
  And when Hamas terrorists actively hide behind innocent Palestinians, 
knowing that many of those civilians will die in the Israeli response, 
why does the criticism for any civilian death seem to fall exclusively 
on Israel and not at all on Hamas?
  My heart breaks for the thousands of Palestinian civilians who have 
been killed or are suffering in this conflict--so many children. And I 
have urged the Israeli Government to minimize civilian casualties on 
many occasions. But by committing such heinous atrocities on October 7 
before sneaking back into their tunnels underneath hospitals and 
refugee camps in Gaza, Hamas has knowingly invited an immense civilian 
toll during the war, exploiting the double standard that so much of the 
world applies to Israel.
  Of course--let me repeat--that does not relieve Israel of the 
responsibility to protect innocent Palestinian lives, and I have been 
among the first to tell Israeli leaders they must act according to 
international law. I am also fighting for critical humanitarian aid for 
Palestinians that this Senate, under my leadership, is working to 
deliver.
  So I rise in this Chamber today. I am speaking up to issue a warning, 
informed by lessons of history too often forgotten. No matter what our 
beliefs, no matter where we stand on the war in Gaza, all of us must 
condemn anti-Semitism with full-throated clarity wherever we see it 
before it metastasizes into something even worse because, right now, 
that is what Jewish Americans fear most.
  The spike in anti-Semitism we are experiencing right now in America 
began after the worst instance of violence committed against Jewish 
people since the Holocaust. The vitriol against Israel in the wake of 
October 7 is all too often crossing the line into brazen and widespread 
anti-Semitism, the likes of which we haven't seen for generations in 
this country, if ever, which is why we need to name it clearly anytime 
we see it.
  After October 7, when boycotts were organized against Jewish 
businesses in Philadelphia that have nothing to do with Israel, that is 
anti-Semitism.
  After October 7, when swastikas appeared on Jewish delis on the Upper 
East Side, that is anti-Semitism.
  After October 7, when protesters in California shouted at Jewish 
Americans, ``Hitler should have smashed you,'' that is anti-Semitism.
  After October 7, when a Jewish U.S. Senator was violently threatened 
for her views on Israel, that is anti-Semitism.
  After October 7, when students on college campuses across the country 
who wear a yarmulke or display a Jewish star are harassed, verbally 
vilified, pushed, even spat upon and punched, that is anti-Semitism.
  After October 7, when an author in a prominent leftwing magazine 
labeled the pro-Israeli rally in Washington a ``hate rally,'' that is 
anti-Semitism. I attended that rally--like tens of thousands, hundreds 
of thousands of others--because I believe there should be a place of 
refuge for the Jewish people, not because I wish violence on 
Palestinians or any other people.
  And, Mr. President, after October 7, when students at Hillcrest High 
School in Queens ran rampant in the hallways and demanded the firing of 
a teacher--these are high school students demanding the firing of a 
teacher--just because that teacher attended a rally supporting Israel 
and forced her to hide in a locked office for hours while staff 
struggled to regain control, that is anti-Semitism.

  Walking out of the school to march in support of Palestinians is 
completely legitimate, but forcing a Jewish teacher to remain--as she 
described--locked in an office because she attended a rally in support 
for Israel is anti-Semitism, pure and simple.
  In fact, Mr. President, the teacher whom I am speaking about is 
sitting in the Gallery today, right now. I invited her to come and 
listen, and I am truly honored that she accepted my invitation. That is 
true courage. I believe it shows just how strongly so many Jewish 
Americans feel about the issue.
  She has requested anonymity, which I ask everybody present and 
everyone in the media to please respect, but I say to her from the 
bottom of my heart: Thank you for being here. Thank you for caring.
  I have just listed a few of the so many examples--there are so many 
more--of how the pure, unadulterated anti-Semitism has dramatically 
increased since October 7, but the roots of pluralistic, multiethnic 
democracy are deep in America. This is a place

[[Page S5647]]

where Jewish people have been able to flourish alongside so many other 
immigrant groups. We must never lose sight of just how special that is, 
nor must we ever stop fighting for it.
  All Americans share a responsibility and an obligation to fight back 
whenever we see the rise of prejudice of any type in our midst, to 
preserve this Nation as a promised land of refuge, as a land that 
honors the dignity of every individual, as a land of opportunity for 
all.
  So my plea--my plea, my fervent plea--to the American people of all 
creeds and backgrounds is this: First, learn the history of the Jewish 
people who have been abandoned repeatedly by their fellow countrymen. I 
say this particularly to younger people who didn't live with any of 
this history. Learn the history of the Jewish people who have been left 
isolated and alone to combat anti-Semitism through the centuries.
  Second, reject the illogical and anti-Semitic double standard that is 
once again being applied to the plight of Jewish victims and hostages, 
to some of the actions of the Israeli Government, and even to the very 
existence of a Jewish state. That is a double standard. There is no 
ducking from it.
  Third, understand why Jewish people defend Israel--not because we 
wish harm on Palestinians but because we fear a world where Israel is 
forced to tolerate the existence of groups like Hamas that want to wipe 
out all Jewish people from the planet.
  Some of us watched this film, which the public can't see, which 
showed the brutality and viciousness that every Israeli citizen and 
every Jew feels.
  We fear a world where Israel, a place of refuge for Jewish people, 
will no longer exist. If there is no Israel, there will be no place--no 
place--for Jewish people to go when they are persecuted in other 
countries.
  As an adult, I remember watching my grandfather, one of the few in 
his family to survive the Holocaust, being overwhelmed by emotion and 
breaking down in tears when he saw Israel for the first time. This had 
nothing to do with politics or with money or with racism or oppression. 
It was deeply human--the emotional catharsis of a man whose family was 
uprooted and exterminated finally stepping foot in the place of refuge 
for his people, the place that the Jewish people have yearned for not 
just for decades, for centuries, but for millennia.
  So many of my aunts and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews 
would be alive today had Israel existed before World War II, as I said 
before.
  Many Jewish Americans fear what the future may bring based on the 
repeated lessons of history. Many Jewish Americans see clear anti-
Semitism in the double standard that is being wielded by too many 
opponents of Israel, and we see it in attacks on Jewish people for 
simply being Jewish, apart from having anything to do with Israel. And 
maybe worst of all, many Jewish Americans feel alone to face all of 
this, abandoned by too many of our friends and allies in our greatest 
time of need, as anti-Semitic hate crimes skyrocket across the country.
  I implore every person, every community, every institution to stand 
with Jewish Americans--not to ignore it, not to shrug your shoulders--
to denounce anti-Semitism in all its forms, especially the double 
standard that has been wielded against the Jewish people for 
generations to isolate us.
  The time for solidarity must be now. Nothing less than the future of 
the American experiment hangs in the balance. Building a more perfect 
Union, one that fulfills our founding ideals, is our longest and most 
solemn struggle as a country. And as Americans, we are called on to do 
all we can to achieve that higher standard.
  We are stewards of the flames of liberty, tolerance, and equality 
that warm our American melting pot and make it possible for Jewish 
Americans to prosper alongside Palestinian Americans and every other

  Are we a nation that can defy the regular course of human history 
where the Jewish people have been ostracized, expelled, and massacred 
over and over again? I believe--truly believe in my heart--that the 
answer can and must be a resounding yes, and I will do everything in my 
power as Senate majority leader, as a Jewish American, as a citizen of 
a free society, as a human being, to make it happen.

situation in the Middle East. As you know and the American people know, 
there have been five wars--five wars--in the last 15 years between 
Israel and Hamas.
  How do we end the current one and prevent a sixth war from happening 
sooner or later? How do we balance our desire to stop the fighting with 
the need to address the root causes of this conflict?
  And here is the sad truth--and it really is a very sad truth. For 75 
years, diplomats, well-intentioned Israelis and Palestinians, and 
government leaders all over the world, including Presidents of the 
United States, have struggled to bring peace to this region. And during 
that time, among many other things, an Egyptian President and an 
Israeli Prime Minister were assassinated by extremists.
  Do you know why? Because they tried to bring peace to the region. 
This is an incredibly difficult and complicated issue, and nobody has 
any simple solution to it.
  As one of the first Members of Congress to call for a humanitarian 
pause to the bombing, I have been very encouraged to see that pause 
finally happen over the last 5 days and to see its extension earlier 
this week. That is a very positive development.
  This temporary cease-fire has brought some relief to Gaza and to the 
families of the more than 100 hostages released so far. The break in 
fighting has let an average of 200 trucks per day to enter Gaza, 
carrying desperately needed food, water, medical supplies, and the fuel 
necessary to distribute aid, pump water, and run hospitals and 
bakeries.

  While this is only 40 percent--and people must recognize this, before 
the war, there were 500 trucks coming in a day, and now, there are 
200--it is still a very substantial improvement over where we were a 
few weeks ago.
  It seems to me that our job now is to keep working to extend this 
window further and to get more aid in and to get more hostages out--
more aid in, more hostages out. Right now, critical talks are under way 
that will hopefully provide the United Nations the time it needs to 
establish a sustained humanitarian operation that can meet people's 
basic needs and provide shelter and medical care. And let us be clear: 
The needs in Gaza are beyond enormous.
  For those of us who want not only to bring this war to an end but to 
avoid future ones, we must first be clear-eyed about the facts. On 
October 7, Hamas--a terrorist organization--unleashed a brutal attack 
against Israel, killing about 1,200 innocent men, women, and children 
and taking more than 200 hostages.
  No one--no one--in the U.S. Senate, no one in Congress, denies that 
Israel has the right to respond to that murderous attack. 
Unfortunately, however, under the leadership of its rightwing Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under indictment for corruption and 
whose Cabinet includes outright racists, Israel unleashed what amounts 
to almost total war against the Palestinian people.
  Israel's widespread bombing has left nearly 15,000 people dead--that 
is in a 7-week period--15,000 people dead, two-thirds of whom are women 
and children. And tens of thousands of others were wounded.
  Israel's military campaign, up to this point, according to U.N. 
estimates, damaged or destroyed 45 percent of the housing in Gaza--45 
percent--and displaced nearly 1.8 million people. The Israeli attacks, 
up to this point, have killed 109 United Nations workers and left 
millions of Gazans on the brink of starvation, lacking medical care, 
electricity, or fuel.
  This is a humanitarian catastrophe that risks, among other things, 
igniting a wider regional conflagration. We all want this horror to end 
as soon as possible. To make progress, however, we must grapple with 
the complexity of this situation.
  First, Hamas has made it clear, before and after--after--their 
October 7 attack that its goal is perpetual warfare and the destruction 
of the State of Israel. Several weeks ago, a spokesman for Hamas told 
the New York Times:

       I hope that the state of war with Israel will become 
     permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will 
     stand with us.

  Let me repeat it. This is the Hamas spokesman:

       I hope that the state of war with Israel will become 
     permanent on all the borders and that the Arab world will 
     stand with us.

  So that is the first point.
  The second point is that, if we go back a little bit in history, we 
understand that Israel has done nothing in recent years to give hope 
for a peaceful settlement--maintaining the blockade of Gaza, deepening 
the daily humiliations of occupation in the West Bank, and largely 
ignoring the horrendous living conditions facing Palestinians. Massive 
poverty existed in Gaza before October 7. Something like 70 percent of 
the young people in Gaza were unemployed.
  How is that for a reality in terms of despair and hopelessness? Those 
are the conditions that existed before the Israeli attack.
  Needless to say, I do not have all of the answers to this never-
ending tragedy. But for those of us who believe in peace and for those 
of us who believe in justice, it is imperative that we do our best to 
provide Israelis and Palestinians with a thoughtful response that maps 
out a realistic path to addressing the reality we face today.
  Let me just give you a few of my thoughts as to the best way forward 
and how the United States can rally the world around a moral position 
that moves us toward peace in the region and justice for an oppressed 
Palestinian population.
  To start with, in my view, we must demand an immediate end to 
Israel's indiscriminate bombing, which is causing and has caused an 
enormous number of civilian casualties and is in violation of 
international law.
  The main point here is: Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the 
Palestinian people. Israel cannot bomb an entire neighborhood just to 
take out one Hamas lieutenant. That is simply not acceptable and not 
something the United States should be complicit with.
  Further, we must extend the humanitarian pause that exists right now 
so that the United Nations has the time to safely set up the 
distribution network needed to prevent thirst, starvation, and disease, 
to build shelters, and to evacuate those who need critical care.
  Once again, we are looking at an unimaginable humanitarian crisis, 
and the U.N. is going to need as much time as it can get to try to help 
people in desperate need. This window will also allow for talks to free 
as many hostages as possible. And I think we all would like to see 
every hostage returned to their loved ones. This extended pause must 
not precede a resumption of a discriminate bombing. Israel will 
continue to go after Hamas, but it must dramatically change its tactics 
to minimize civilian harm.
  If long-suffering Palestinians are ever going to have a chance at 
self-determination and a decent standard of living, there must be no 
long-term Israeli reoccupation and blockade of Gaza. If Hamas is going 
to be removed from power--as they must be--and Palestinians given the 
opportunity for a better life, an Israeli occupation of Gaza would be 
absolutely counterproductive and would benefit Hamas. Imagine Israeli 
soldiers all over an occupied Gaza. For the sake of regional peace and 
a brighter future for the Palestinian people, Gaza must have a chance 
to be free of Hamas. There can be no long-term Israeli occupation.
  To achieve the political transformation that Gaza needs--and Gaza 
desperately needs a political transformation--new Palestinian 
leadership will be required as part of a wider political process. And 
for that transformation and peace process to take place, Israel must 
make political commitments that will allow for Palestinian leadership 
committed to peace to build support. What I think people all over the 
world want to see and what

[[Page S5679]]

the people of Gaza want to see is leadership that will take care of 
their needs, provide for them, allow them self-determination, not 
leadership in perpetual warfare with Israel.
  Israel must also guarantee displaced Palestinians the absolute right 
to return to their homes as Gaza rebuilds. And I am very concerned by 
some of the remarks we hear from Israel, from some Israeli leadership, 
questioning that basic right of people to return to their communities.
  People who have lived in poverty and despair for years, as people in 
Gaza have, cannot be made permanently homeless. Israel must also commit 
to end the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and freeze 
settlements there as a first step to permanently ending the occupation.
  Those steps will show that peace can deliver for the Palestinian 
people, hopefully giving the Palestinian Authority the legitimacy it 
needs to assume administrative control of Gaza, likely after an interim 
stabilization period under an international force.
  Finally, if Palestinians are to have any hope for a decent future, 
there must be a commitment to broad peace talks to advance a new two-
state solution in the wake of this war.
  The United States, the international community, and Israel's 
neighbors must move aggressively toward that two-state goal. This would 
include dramatically increased international support for the 
Palestinian people, including from wealthy Gulf States. It would also 
mean the promise of full recognition of Palestine pending the formation 
of a new democratically elected government committed to peace with 
Israel.
  Let us be clear--and I think this is the main point that I want to 
make this evening--that we should be clear that all of this is not 
going to happen on its own. Left alone, sad to say, Israel is not going 
to bring this about.
  Prime Minister Netanyahu's Likud Party was explicitly formed on the 
premise that ``between the Sea and the Jordan [River] there will only 
be Israeli sovereignty.'' And the current coalition agreement 
reinforces that goal. This is not just ideology. This idea that Israel 
has the right to control everything between the sea and the Jordan 
River, that is just not ideology. The Israeli Government has 
systematically pursued this goal.
  The last year saw record Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank 
where more than 700,000 Israelis now live in areas that the United 
Nations and the United States agree are occupied territories. They have 
used state violence to back up this de facto annexation.
  Sadly, tragically, since October 7, the United Nations reports that 
at least 208 Palestinians, including 53 children, have been killed by 
Israeli security forces and settlers. This cannot be allowed to 
continue.
  Mr. Netanyahu has made clear where he stands on these critical 
issues. Now is the time for us to make clear where we stand on these 
issues. And the truth is that if asking nicely worked, we wouldn't be 
in the position we are today. Asking nicely just is not going to bring 
about the kinds of changes that are needed.
  The only way these vital and necessary changes will occur is if the 
United States uses the substantial leverage we have with Israel, and we 
all know what that leverage is. For many years, the United States has 
provided Israel with substantial sums of money, with close to no 
strings attached. Currently, we provide $3.8 billion a year to Israel, 
no strings attached.
  President Biden has asked for $14.3 billion more on top of that sum 
and asked Congress to waive normal, already limited oversight rules. 
This blank check approach must end. The United States must make clear 
that while we are friends of Israel, there are conditions to that 
friendship and that we cannot be complicit in actions that violate 
international law and our own sense of decency. That includes an end to 
indiscriminate bombing, a significant pause to the bombing so that 
massive humanitarian assistance can come into the region, the right of 
displaced Gazans to return to their homes, no long-term Israeli 
occupation of Gaza, an end to settler violence in the West Bank and a 
freeze on settlement expansion, and maybe, most importantly, a 
commitment to broad peace talks for a two-state solution in the wake of 
this war.
  Over the years, people of good will around the world, including 
Israelis and Palestinians, have tried to address this conflict in a way 
that brings justice to the Palestinians and security for Israel. Israel 
is entitled to security, to be free of terrorist attacks.
  Now, I and some other Members of Congress have tried over the years 
to do what we could. Obviously, painfully, we did not do enough. Now, 
we must recommit to this effort. The stakes are just too high to give 
up. It is clear that Netanyahu and his extreme rightwing government are 
not going to do this on their own, which is why the United States must 
use its leverage to force these necessary changes and push hard for a 
wider political process that leads to a two-state solution.
  These should be the conditions of our solidarity, including in the 
supplemental spending bill, which we will soon be considering.
  Israel is a longtime friend and ally of the United States, and I 
respect that, but when there is this level of destruction and bloodshed 
and when tens of billions of dollars have been requested, it is more 
than reasonable for the United States to have a say in where our 
taxpayer dollars go and how they are spent. This is money that comes 
from the taxpayers of the United States.

  Israel has an absolute right to defend itself, but it does not have 
the right to use American taxpayer funds in violation of international 
law or with little regard for civilian casualties. Now, I know that 
when we use the word ``conditioning,'' people become very alarmed. Oh 
my God, terrible idea. Virtually every dollar that we appropriate has 
conditions attached to it. If you are on food stamps tonight, you have 
got conditions. If you are on unemployment, you have got conditions. If 
you are on section 8 housing, you have conditions. We have conditions 
on everything. We don't give away money. We say you have to be eligible 
for it; this is what you have got to do; these are the requirements. 
That is conditioning.
  Conditioning, in fact, has been, for a long time, seen as a key to 
U.S. policy regarding foreign governments, including Israel, not a new 
idea. The United States has routinely conditioned aid on countries, 
including Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, to name a few. Presidents 
Carter, Reagan, H. W. Bush, and Clinton, all conditioned aid to Israel 
to secure changes in their policies.
  President Reagan actually suspended certain arms deliveries and 
threatened to stop all military aid due to Israel's war in Lebanon. 
That is a condition, a pretty strong condition. Sending $14.3 billion 
to Netanyahu's government on top of the $3.8 billion we provide every 
year and the billions of arms the United States has already provided 
with no strings attached would be a huge mistake, out of step with 
longstanding U.S. policy, and not something I believe that the American 
people want to see.
  I have laid out what I believe some of these conditions should be, 
and that is an end to the indiscriminate bombing that we have seen, a 
guarantee that displaced Palestinians will have the right to return to 
their homes, no long-term occupation or blockade of Gaza, a freeze on 
the West Bank settlements there, and a commitment to broad peace talks 
for a two-state solution.
  Those are some of the conditions that I think we have more than a 
right to demand when we provide money to Israel.
  Finally, let me end this on a personal note. There is no question 
that people all over this country have strong disagreements on the war 
and some of the issues that I have been discussing tonight, and that is 
what is part of the democratic process. And in a democracy like ours, 
it is natural that these issues be debated, and people have different 
points of view.
  But what we cannot do, under any circumstances, is turn to violence 
because of our differences--not to violence and not to bigotry. And I 
have to say that, tragically, in my home State of Vermont, in the city 
that I live, a city of 40,000 people, Burlington, VT, we have 
experienced this form of violent hate.
  And just as I am sure you know, 3 days ago, three young men, lovely 
young men going to college, celebrating Thanksgiving in Burlington,

[[Page S5680]]

VT, were shot, and one of them is in very serious condition. So as we 
all hope and pray for the recovery of Hisham and Kinnan and Tahseen, 
the three young men who were shot, and we await the findings of the 
investigation into this terrible act, let me say this again loudly and 
clearly: Hate has no place in my State of Vermont or anyplace else in 
America. With Islamophobia, anti-Arab hate, anti-Semitism, and racism 
on the rise in this country, we must--must--come together and remain 
resolute in our commitment to fighting all forms of bigotry and 
intolerance.
  I yield the floor."

  Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, Hisham, Kinnan, and Tahseen are all 
Palestinian college students who were shot while wearing a keffiyeh and 
speaking Arabic on their way to a family dinner in Vermont.
  Just weeks ago, a 6-year-old Palestinian-American child, Wadea, was 
stabbed 26 times in a hate crime in Illinois. They had to take the 
knife out of his body.
  Mr. Speaker, the constant dehumanization of Palestinians has real 
consequences. It is fueling anti-Palestinian racism and violence. The 
dehumanization and rhetoric repeated by many elected officials, many in 
this Chamber, is inciting violence against Palestinians.
  My heart goes out to every family affected by violence, Islamophobia, 
anti-Palestinian racism, and any form of hate.
  One of the Palestinian victims who was shot in Burlington, Hisham, 
wrote: ``This hideous crime did not happen in a vacuum. As much as I 
appreciate and love every single one of you here today, I am but one 
casualty in this much wider conflict.
  ``Had I been shot in the West Bank, where I grew up, the medical 
services that saved my life here would likely have been withheld by the 
Israeli Army. The soldier who shot me would go home and never be 
convicted. . . . Any attack like this is horrific, be it here or in 
Palestine.
  ``That is why when you say your wishes and light your candles today, 
your mind should not just be focused on me as an individual but, 
rather, as a proud member of a people being oppressed.''
  When I talk about Hisham, Kinnan, and Tahseen, I think of my two 
Palestinian boys living right here in the United States."

                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 5961) to freeze certain Iranian funds involved in the 2023 
hostage deal between the United States and Iran, and for other

  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the

exceed 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the Chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or their respective 
designees.
  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) and the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. Meeks), each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul).
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Chair, we are here today because the Biden 
administration cut a dangerous, reckless hostage deal that puts a price 
on every American head all over the world. We have a responsibility to 
the American people to repair this damage.
  First, let me say that I am relieved that Americans held hostage by 
Iran are safely at home. They have been through a terrible ordeal and 
should never have been imprisoned in the first place.
  As part of this deal, the administration dropped charges against five 
Iranian criminals charged with endangering our national security, 
including by aiding Iran's nuclear program.
  At Iran's request, the administration waived sanctions on $6 billion 
of Iranian funds, which have been frozen in South Korea to allow that 
that money be transferred and funneled to a bank account in Doha, 
Qatar--an undisclosed bank, Madam Chair.
  Under this deal, Iran is getting access to $1.2 billion per blue 
passport, per American citizen. It is obvious that this agreement 
incentivizes more hostage taking.
  The administration is claiming this money can only be used for 
humanitarian purchases like food and medicine.
  We all know that Iran has a long history of sanctioned evasion and 
money laundering. It means that we cannot truly know where the funds 
end up or how they will be used.
  If we had any doubt about Iran's intentions, look no further than 
DOJ's 2019 indictment under the previous administration against a 
Turkish bank.
  This bank played a central role in facilitating billions of dollars' 
worth of fraudulent Iranian transactions.
  These transactions were manipulated to look like humanitarian 
expenses when, in fact, no such purchases took place.
  This is nothing new, but let's look at Iran's own words. Iran's 
President Raisi bragged to the world that Iran would spend the $6 
billion ``wherever we need it.''
  What more evidence do we need, Madam Chair, than that? This is not 
going for humanitarian purposes. It is going toward terrorism--wherever 
we need it.
  Money is fungible, as everybody knows. Given Iran's access to these 
funds for any purpose frees up money for its malign activities, 
including its support to proxies like we saw on October 7 to Hamas.
  Blocking money to Iran is the most consequential thing we can do here 
in this Congress to stop Iran's financing of terrorism to Hamas and 
other proxies to help keep our troops safe who are now under fire from 
Iran-backed militias.
  After Hamas' brutal October 7 massacre of over 1,200 innocent people 
in Israel, the largest attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust, 
Madam Chair, and over 70 attacks on our forces by Iran-backed proxies 
this fall, no one can deny Iran's role as the world's leading state 
sponsor of terror.
  Put simply, the Middle East is on fire, and Iran's proxies are 
becoming more aggressive every day with increasing attacks, threatening 
to throw the Middle East into complete destabilization.
  Now Iran's destabilization influence extends beyond the Middle East. 
They continue to supply deadly drones to Russia, supporting their 
unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine.

                              {time}  1230

  Iran is going to keep throwing tens of millions of dollars to Hamas 
and other terror groups propping them up with our adversaries, like 
China, Russia, and North Korea, with weapons. We need to take every 
measure possible to stop Iran from giving its proxies another dime.
  Madam Chair, after the October 7 attack by Hamas in which they took 
240 hostages, it is absolutely undeniable this hostage deal was a 
catastrophic mistake.
  Madam Chair, we met with some of the families yesterday, and it was 
one

[[Page H6001]]

of the most horrific experiences to hear what their loved ones are 
going through right now in Gaza. Americans held hostage, who we have 
still not been able to get out, they are in absolute hell right now, in 
darkness.
  The narrative was something before October 7. Now, after October 7, 
they are trying to hide from this deal because they know what they did 
was wrong, and they know what they are doing is funding terror in the 
Middle East.
  This body, this Congress needs to repair that damage. That is why my 
bill, the No Funds For Iranian Terrorism Act, imposes new sanctions to 
permanently prevent the transfer of $6 billion in Iranian funds covered 
under the 2023 hostage deal; which, by the way, Madam Chair, I haven't 
seen this deal. The administration says there is a deal. They have not 
provided that deal to me nor to my colleagues, to my knowledge.
  One thing is clear, this is a moment of moral clarity. With such 
instability in the region, the last thing we need to do is to give Iran 
access to $6 billion to be diverted to more Iranian-sponsored 
terrorism. We must sanction anyone who enables the transfer or 
processing of transactions of these funds, period.
  Put very simply and succinctly, I can't imagine how anybody can vote 
against this bill. How can anybody support $6 billion going into Iran 
when we know, both in classified space, which we can't talk about here, 
but in the declassified space, exactly who was behind October 7.
  Iran is the head of the snake, and the snake had its tentacles all 
throughout the Middle East: in Gaza with Hamas; in Yemen with the 
Houthi rebels; and in Iran and Syria with Iran-backed militias, who, by 
the way, Madam Chair, are hitting our troops every day. They are under 
fire by Iran. We are going to give them $6 billion?
  Now, the other side will say that is Iran's money. It is sanctioned 
money. This administration chose to lift the sanctions on the $6 
billion.
  My bill says, no, Mr. President. We, in the Congress, say no to this 
policy. We are going to put sanctions on the money so Iran cannot get 
access to this to fund more terrorism, more killing of innocent Jewish 
people. I don't have to go into graphic detail of what happened on 
October 7, but we all saw the Hamas video and the gruesomeness of it.
  I, Madam Chair, will not sit by idly and allow this to happen while 
Americans are under fire and the Jewish people are being killed by 
these terrorists.
  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Let me first start off by saying the President of the United States 
did the right thing. It is easy to say why we should vote against this 
bill.
  My good friend, the chairman, has talked about October 7 over and 
over. Our committee has had several family members come before our 
committee where we have vowed to do everything we can to get their 
family members back home.
  For me, it has been very personal. Yesterday, we talked to a group of 
family members. We told them we will not stop until we get their family 
members back home.
  Negotiating to bring our hostages home is hard because you have to do 
it with bad people.
  Guess what? Hamas committed the heinous acts on October 7, but who 
are we negotiating with to get the hostages home? Hamas. It is not 
easy, but we vowed in front of these witnesses.
  I wonder what we would say to those five individuals and families, 
who are now safe at home, before they were released? Would we have 
promised them and didn't we promise them we would do everything we 
could to get them back home?
  Yes, President Biden did the right thing. He brought five Americans 
home who were rotting in Iran's notorious Evan prison.
  Every Member of Congress--I repeat, every Member of this Congress who 
was aware of these cases wanted our fellow citizens to come home. Now, 
they are saying they should not have come home.
  This was done, wanting them to come home, with a bipartisan voice. 
President Biden thus succeeded in doing what his predecessors could 
not. He got them home.
  Iran, of course, as is Hamas, is a murderous and corrupt regime. They 
are not pleasant, and this isn't easy. Thanks to this agreement, five 
American families are now whole again, and Iran has lost the leverage 
of holding these American hostages.
  Now, H.R. 5961 would sanction parties that carry out the financial 
terms of the hostage agreement in question. These include three 
European commercial banks and the Central Bank of Qatar, who, by the 
way, has been very instrumental in working with us to get hostages home 
that were taken on October 7, but let's really talk about the facts.
  Yes, I have been in classified sessions and nonclassified sessions 
and have heard it, as all of us have. Let's talk about the facts.
  Billions of Iran's own profits from oil sales were sitting in a 
restricted account in South Korea. It was done by the prior 
administration. It was established by the Trump administration for Iran 
to make approved humanitarian purchases. This wasn't done by the Biden 
administration. It was sitting in South Korea, by the Trump 
administration, for humanitarian purchases.
  The United States had no control over that account while it was 
sitting there. The agreement moved that $6 billion from the restricted 
account in South Korea, converted it to euros, and relocated it into 
the restricted account in Qatar, which now the United States has 
visibility over--not a single penny--facts, not conjecture, facts.

  I don't think anyone can refute the fact that not a single penny has 
moved into Iran. Not one. Not a penny, much less a dime. Not a penny 
has moved into Iran.
  Under the terms of the agreement, Iran can use the money in Qatar to 
make approved humanitarian purchases to acquire medicine, medical 
equipment, agricultural goods, and food. Iran's government physically 
will never touch this money. The entirety of the transaction occurs 
outside of Iran, and Iran only receives the vetted humanitarian goods.
  By the way, that is consistent with our values, and that is why we, 
in all of this, are talking about humanitarian concerns for people who 
are just victimized by bad people.
  Thus far, Iran has not made any requests of the humanitarian fund, 
and nothing has been gained by Iran. All of the money remains in the 
account, an account that the United States can watch.
  We have leverage over that account due to our relationship with the 
correspondent banks in Europe that would help process any transactions. 
In other words, we know we now have more control over this money than 
we did when it was sitting in South Korea. In fact, this account 
provides us with leverage, not the other way around.
  Furthermore, following the horrific attacks in Israel on October 7, 
the United States and Qatar froze the humanitarian fund, so it is 
frozen now in Qatar. No humanitarian purchases will be approved any 
time soon. Again, nothing has changed.
  The money remains in the account and we continue to have leverage. 
Nothing has changed from when the money was sitting in South Korea.
  The only thing that has changed is five American citizens are no 
longer sitting in an Iranian prison. They are back home with their 
families.
  Madam Chair, if H.R. 5961 is passed into law, that leverage will be 
gone. It will disappear. We will also lose our ability to conduct 
diplomacy with Iran and others in the future. If we blow up this 
agreement by passing this bill, we, the United States, will be the ones 
breaking yet another sensitive negotiated agreement.
  Our word and integrity will no longer be good in negotiations, 
whether it is with Iran or any other parties. The United States must 
continue to address--and here is where I think we agree--no one is 
saying that the United States needs to continue to address Iran's 
backing of groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.
  The Iranian-supported Hamas terrorists unleashed pure evil when they 
broke a cease-fire in the attacks on October 7. The population of Gaza 
would not be engulfed in war right now if it were not for Hamas. But we 
must also remain sober and serious about the challenge of Iran's 
nefarious nuclear

[[Page H6002]]

program. None of the bad options we possess to stop Iran's nuclear 
ambitions are better than the diplomatic track, which has already 
proven successful.
  It was the United States who actually violated the JCPOA, not Iran. 
Pulling out of this hostage agreement will be the second time we 
violate an agreement with Iran's leaders. Passage of this bill would 
mean potentially slamming the door closed on future diplomacy, leaving 
us only with dangerous and highly risky options of confronting Iran's 
nuclear program.
  We all agree, Iran must not ever have a nuclear weapon, but guess 
what, since we pulled out of JCPOA, they are closer to getting a 
nuclear weapon than had we been in there.
  Madam Chair, the prisoner swap confirms to the Iranian regime that 
the United States is a reliable negotiating partner, just as we see 
taking place right now.
  As we bring the hostages home from Gaza, they have to deal with 
Hamas. Both sides have to keep their word. We have warned Israel, who 
is a strong, diplomatic, honest country moving forward, fighting for 
its existence but have to deal with Hamas. They made an agreement, and 
they are living by that agreement. Hostages are coming home, and we 
want that to continue for each and every one of them. They are not just 
simply being released, Israel is giving something back in return.
  In our case, Iran is actually not getting anything because they are 
not getting a dime to be utilized for their nefarious purposes.
  Madam Chair, let me conclude with this: The agreement has freed five 
Americans--I repeat, five American citizens--who were suffering in an 
Iranian prison, who we all, in a bipartisan way, said we would do 
anything to get them home. We wanted them to be home.
  It shifted Iran's own money from an account in Korea that we did not 
control, to one where we play a role and have control that we didn't in 
South Korea.

                              {time}  1245

  Not a single penny has left the account. I don't think anybody can 
refute that. Not a single penny has left the account. Not a single 
penny has entered Iran. Not a single U.S. taxpayer dollar has been 
involved.
  This fund remains frozen indefinitely by the United States in Qatar, 
which has been working closely with us and Israel.
  There is no reason to jeopardize future negotiations or further 
inflame an already dangerous situation by passing this bill. The fact 
of the matter is, I don't see why we would want to pass this bill. We 
know that diplomacy is the first thing we need to move forward in 
bringing our people home.
  Lastly, let me just say this because I want to be absolutely clear: I 
don't want Iran's leaders to benefit from our actions in any shape, 
fashion, or form. This hostage agreement that stands today, they have 
not benefited from it and will not benefit from it.
  Unfortunately, this legislation will shoot American global 
credibility in the foot without even touching Iranian regime leaders. 
We encourage this House not to rush into passing this bill. Let's keep 
the door open for diplomacy.
  This stands as an example with Iran and others because we have 
adversaries, but you always have to deal with those adversaries and 
negotiate and talk to try to figure out how we can live in a better 
place.
  Let's think ahead. Let's not play checkers. Let's play chess. That is 
what this is all about.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Self), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. SELF. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of Chairman McCaul's 
bill to ensure no funding for Iranian terrorism. While I am stunned by 
what I heard from my colleague across the aisle, I will try to bring 
clarity to this.
  In August, President Biden surrendered access to $6 billion to Iran--
make no mistake about it--for five hostages. Once again, he 
demonstrated weakness to our adversaries. In doing so, he signaled to 
Hamas that his administration is willing to reward hostage taking.
  The policy of the United States for years was no negotiations with 
terrorists or with hostage takers. We knew at that time that precedent 
was powerful. Now, weak precedent is dangerous.
  In October, Hamas official Ali Baraka said of the $6 billion deal: 
``The U.S. conducts prisoner swaps. Only recently, it did one with 
Iran. Why wouldn't it conduct a prisoner swap with us?''
  Now, Hamas is holding the West hostage, the entire West hostage, as 
they fortify their defenses while Israeli hostages are traded for 
Palestinian prisoners, including terrorists.
  There is only one language that is understood by our adversaries, and 
that is strength.
  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send a 
message that we will not fund the radical jihadist agenda.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Let me just say that I keep hearing this demonstrates weakness. The 
Biden administration demonstrated strength in being willing to stand 
with your enemies and negotiate.
  I can recall, for me, even in our own country, what I learned to live 
by. Many folks were thinking that when Dr. King was moving forward with 
nonviolence, he was demonstrating weakness and that we should go back 
and fight. He demonstrated strength. Sometimes when dealing and 
negotiating, that is where strength comes from, and if you just go out 
swinging, you demonstrate weakness.
  What Joe Biden has done was kept his word, number one. He said that 
he would bring, whenever he could, American hostages home. This body 
has said to American families that we would do everything and anything 
to bring their families home. We should keep our word.
  President Biden kept his word to those five American hostages, and 
the United States House of Representatives should keep its word and not 
challenge the agreement that the President made to return those five 
American hostages.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr.  Mike Garcia), a member of the Committee on Armed 
Services.
  Mr. MIKE GARCIA of California. Madam Chair, it should not take an act 
of Congress to stop our President, the President of the United States, 
from sending $6 billion to Iran. Iran is the world's most prolific 
sponsor of terrorism, but here we are, having to go through this.
  This administration has said that this money is to be used for 
humanitarian purposes only. Madam Chair, that is like giving money to a 
junkie and expecting them to buy food with it. You can tell them to buy 
food with it, and they can promise you that they will buy food with it. 
We all know he ain't buying food with it.
  In this case, Iran will not use this money for humanitarian 
assistance. Even if they did, it would just free up other cash so they 
could fund their international terror organizations and nuclear 
ambitions. Now that we have control of these assets, let's not let this 
money be weaponized against us, our allies, and especially Israel.
  Madam Chair, I urge support of the bill.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Again, I haven't heard a reply. Not one penny has gone to Iran. If I 
am wrong, then someone tell me. Not one cent. The money is frozen in 
Qatar. Not one penny.
  None of this could have been used by Hamas, Iran, or anyone for 
October 7. They didn't have a dime.
  The money was there already, put there for humanitarian purposes by 
the Trump administration. It was in South Korea, but we didn't have any 
control over it.
  I didn't hear anybody talk about that when the Trump administration 
was there, that he should not have sent the money to South Korea. This 
should not be something that we are playing politics on.

  The money shifted from South Korea and was changed into euros and 
sent to Qatar, where we have now more visibility than ever. Not a dime 
is going to Iran. We have five American hostages home, and then we are 
going to question the deal.

[[Page H6003]]

  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LaMalfa).
  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Chair, this is a preemptive effort. Why fight so 
hard? If a single penny has not been cut loose yet, good. That means we 
are taking action here that is going to prevent that. Had the Biden 
administration not cut loose the $6 billion in frozen assets to begin 
with, we wouldn't have to do this.
  Why do we have a nonsensical effort to allow Iran to have the option? 
That is why we need to head this off at the pass with H.R. 5961, the No 
Funds for Iranian Terrorism Act.
  We saw a sophisticated attack launched in Gaza by Hamas, and we are 
continuing this process to allow Iran to be the biggest state sponsor 
of terror in the world. We need to head it off at the pass, as I said.
  It is ridiculous that we have to fight so hard to have this 
preemptive effort. I just don't understand it. I don't understand a lot 
of things coming out of the Middle East with the pro-Palestinian 
efforts all over this country and all over the world when Israel is 
simply a country that seeks peace.
  Yes, we got five wrongfully detained American hostages in exchange 
for these frozen assets, but the President must impose sanctions on the 
foreign financial institutions involved in processing the transfer of 
these funds. Head it off at the pass. Don't allow it to happen. Why 
would we be in the business of helping Iran to destroy Israel?
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. Kim), the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs' 
Subcommittee on Indo-Pacific.
  Mrs. KIM of California. Madam Chair, I thank Chairman McCaul for 
yielding.
  Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5961, the No Funds for 
Iranian Terrorism Act, to keep Iran from accessing the $6 billion in 
assets that were unfrozen in September.
  This bill imposes sanctions on international financial institutions 
that process, participate in, or facilitate transactions using or 
involving the $6 billion in unfrozen Iranian assets that were 
transferred from South Korea to Qatar in exchange for five hostages 
kept in Iran in September.
  While I am glad the hostages came back to their homes, we cannot 
incentivize more hostage taking by the Islamic Republic of Iran.
  The administration claims that this funding could be used only for 
humanitarian purposes, but Iranian President Raisi has countered that 
the Islamic Republic of Iran can use the assets ``wherever we need 
it.'' Those are his words.
  Allowing Iran to access these funds would be foolish. Hamas' October 
7 attack on Israel showed the world how much destruction Iran is 
capable of through its illicit finance of terrorist organizations.
  We also now see Iran's proxy militia and terrorist organizations 
carrying out attacks on U.S. troops and military assets in Syria and 
Iraq.
  Congress must take strong action to bolster our sanctions policy and 
stop Iran from accessing assets that it can use to carry out its 
terrorist agenda across the Middle East.
  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Let me say this: The United States has values. What is taking place 
and what took place in Israel and is taking place in Gaza right now is 
why we are fighting so hard to make sure that we have a supplemental 
that includes humanitarian aid.
  We know that there are people in Gaza, Palestinians, who are not part 
of Hamas. Everyone wants to make sure, as we are doing in this pause, 
that humanitarian aid is getting to them. It shows the best of who we 
are as Americans.
  It is also so in Iran. Every Iranian is not part of the regime. In 
fact, the regime is cruel and does not provide humanitarian aid to many 
of its citizens.
  We don't want to be like the regime. We want to show our humanity. 
Yes, when human beings are suffering, we want to make sure that we get 
in humanitarian aid so that we can take care of them. That is what is 
happening right now. That is why we are having the pause in the Middle 
East, in Gaza.
  Doing the hostage exchange, bringing people home, is what we should 
be doing. What we are also doing is bringing in humanitarian aid to 
those individuals who Hamas would never aid.
  So people around the world will respect and know who we are, we 
should never give up on our values. The money that we are talking about 
is not going to be used or getting into the hands of the Iranian 
regime. We are talking about trying to show that we have care and 
humanity for those who are the victims of the regime.

                              {time}  1300

  Humanitarian aid. That is who we should be. We should be proud of the 
fact that we want to try to take care of those who are a part, 
unfortunately, of dictators and authoritarian regimes who will not take 
care of their people. That is not who we are.
  If, in the future, through the constraints that we have and the 
approval that needs to take place we can help somebody that has been 
victimized, I think that is the right thing to do.
  To say that we don't care is the wrong thing to do. I just wonder if 
we would invite those five families of those who have now returned 
home, what would we say to them?
  We wish your folks would have stayed in the prison because the 
President should not have made this deal because of humanitarian aid?
  What would we say to them?
  What can we say to them now? They are listening to us.
  We should renege on the deal and let their loved ones stay in prison?
  Thank God President Biden understands being a humanitarian, bringing 
our folks home, and at the same time having a hard line against Iran 
and Hamas and its affiliates.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Chairman I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Carter).
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I know it is hard to believe, 
and I know that my friends across the other side of the aisle find it 
hard to believe, but the Iranian regime is not our friend. They are no 
friend to the U.S., nor to our allies.
  It is not that we don't care. Yes, we do care. The Iranian regime is 
one of the world's leaders in state sponsored terrorism, and they 
cannot be appeased. We know that. That is why it was alarming when 
President Biden freed up $6 billion in previously frozen funds for Iran 
in September. I am glad that this was later refrozen due to the 
pushback from my colleagues and I--who don't trust Iran any further 
than we can pick them up and throw them--to use that money responsibly.
  The expectation of receiving the funds no doubt contributed to the 
uptick in terror we have seen in the Middle East. I think everyone 
would agree with that.
  According to our intelligence community, Iran provides $1 million a 
year to foreign terrorist organizations, including Hamas and Hezbollah.
  On October 7, Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists brutally attacked 
Israel, killing 1,400 people and taking over 200 hostages. This 
legislation, the No Funds for Iranian Terrorism Act, places immediate 
and mandatory sanctions on foreign financial institutions that 
facilitate the transfer of the restricted Iranian funds covered under 
President Biden's deal.
  It is imperative that the $6 billion remains permanently off-limits 
to the Iranian regime.
  So long as President Biden and his administration continue to weaken 
our country on the world stage, House Republicans stand ready to 
respond with strength.
  Mr. Chair, I look forward to voting for this legislation, and I urge 
my colleagues to pass this vital legislation.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, one question that I think remains unanswered to my 
colleagues on the other side: Are you willing to go and tell the family 
members of those five hostages that are now home that they should still 
be in that prison?
  Are you willing to tell them that we should not have worked out a 
deal with the $6 billion frozen for humanitarian

[[Page H6004]]

concern and that we should renege on the deal and they should go back 
to prison?
  The one thing that is missing is that we got these hostages home, and 
that can't be held over our heads by Iran anymore.
  I don't hear an answer to that.
  What do you say to those families?
  We have talked to families who have loved ones that are hostages. 
What do you say to them? You should still be there? We should not have 
made the deal?
  Is that what you are saying? I think that what I am hearing is that 
this deal should not have been made and those American hostages should 
still be sitting in that Iranian prison?
  I ask my colleagues on the other side: What do you say to those five 
families?
  Do we renege on the deal?
  Do you tell them they should not be home, so we should not have made 
the deal?
  We have hostages before us all the time. What do you say to them?
  I know what I am going to say to them. I am glad their family members 
are home and I am glad Joe Biden made the deal to get them home. He is 
not threatening and not using any U.S. dollars. There is no threat from 
Iran in regard to that $6 billion to be utilized for any aggression on 
their part.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I am ready to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, let me just say this. First, the debate on 
the House floor today is a rare moment where the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee is debating legislation under a rule, rather than under 
suspension.
  For those who don't know what that means, it signifies that this bill 
is not bipartisan. That is in contrast to the great majority of 
legislation that comes out of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  This is the first primary Foreign Affairs bill this year that we are 
debating under a rule this Congress. In the previous two Congresses, 
under the Democratic leadership, we debated a total of one bill under a 
rule.
  One thing I will say, as I have talked throughout this debate, one 
thing that is a fact is that Mr. McCaul is my friend. We always try to 
reach an agreement on all bills. There is no question about that. I am 
not questioning that at all. We are frequently, as we did yesterday, 
very successful.

  We had a completely bipartisan markup, including on a potentially 
game-changing bill that would codify an outbound investment regime to 
protect our economy and our national security. I would say that that is 
the way I do believe this committee is ran, and we work very closely 
together.
  On this bill is one of those times where I do fundamentally disagree 
with the arguments put forward by the majority. I submitted an 
amendment that would have added a national security waiver to the 
legislation. Such a waiver is a very restrictive standard. The 
President can only waive the sanctions if it was vital to the national 
security of the United States. He could not waive the sanctions for 
trivial reasons, nor even for an important economic reason. He could 
only waive the sanctions to protect our national security. Of course, 
that amendment was not made in order.
  Every major sanctions bill over the last 20 years has had basic 
exemptions and waivers, like the amendment I offered to this bill. This 
history includes numerous Republican sanctions, bills targeting Iran. 
By moving a bill today without those very basic guardrails, we are 
undermining bipartisan practices that have been held for decades. We 
are also forfeiting leverage to promote American interests and 
undercutting our credibility around the world.
  As such, I oppose this legislation. It is the wrong time for this 
legislation. It is improper. It will hurt down the road. We need to 
look and have a vision for down the road because, for me, what we do is 
not just about today. It is about--I have three granddaughters, and I 
say this everywhere--it is about 5, 2, and 6 months, so it is about 
what takes place and what opportunities might be available 60 years 
from now.
  As we look back at prior history, things that were done by prior 
Congresses had an effect 50 and 60 years later. People that are our 
allies now, 60 years ago were our enemy. Time changes things. People 
who were our enemies 60 years ago are now our allies.
  Let's think forward. Let's vote this bill down--at least we should 
have the waivers in there. I must oppose this legislation, and I 
encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chairman, let me say to my dear friend from New York, I have 
great admiration and respect for him. He is right, we do work things 
out. Of all the committees, we are the most bipartisan committee, and 
it is important that we speak with one voice as a Nation to the world.
  However, as we also have agreed, there are times we just can't get to 
an agreement. This is one of those times. I just can't in good faith 
support the administration's position on this.
  The gentleman asked a couple questions about why didn't this pass on 
suspension, and that is always our goal. The fact is that five Members 
on his side of the aisle voted in support of this bill. I think what we 
are going to find on the vote on this floor today is you are going to 
have more than five Members vote for this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I admire him and his support for the President. I would 
probably do the same in his case, but I have to, with all due respect, 
disagree.
  What would I say to the five American families?
  I would say: Thank God your loved ones are home. I would say: We are 
with you. I don't think this is just about the five American hostages. 
There is something else going on that just doesn't make sense.
  Mr. Chairman, you have five innocent Americans exchanged for five 
indicted Iranians on charges related to national security. That alone 
is a bad deal. We talk about negotiations--that is not a good 
negotiation.
  Mr. Chairman, if you throw $6 billion on top of this--what is that 
all about?
  I have to ask the question: Why was this money that was frozen in a 
South Korean bank transferred to an undisclosed Doha bank account to 
then be made available for humanitarian purposes to Iran?
  What they will say is: Well, it is still frozen.
  Why was the money transferred to an undisclosed Doha bank account? If 
it was for humanitarian purposes, why couldn't the South Korean bank 
transfer it?
  I will tell you why it was transferred to the Doha bank account--and 
we don't even know the name of the bank, Mr. Chairman. It was 
transferred at the request of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
  Why did they want that?
  They know that they can get access to the Doha bank account. They 
know that in Qatar they are going to be more friendly to them than the 
South Koreans. This didn't happen by accident, it happened by design. 
That is precisely why the money was money laundered to this other bank 
account to funnel into Iran.
  For what purpose, humanitarian?

                              {time}  1315

  I get that. I don't doubt my good friend from New York's heart and 
sincerity. He believes this. Nevertheless, facts are stubborn things.
  Under the previous administration, a bank was prosecuted for the same 
scheme that this administration is perpetuating. A Turkish bank--this 
is from the Department of Justice Public Affairs Office--was 
facilitating transactions to appear to be purchases of food and 
medicine by Iranian customers in order to appear to fall within the so-
called humanitarian exception.
  Mr. Chair, don't take my word for this. Take the President of Iran's 
word for this: I will do whatever I want with the money.
  Let's be clear-eyed and sober about this. Let's not be naive about 
putting $6 billion into Iran at this critical time, Mr. Chairman, after 
October 7, the bloodiest day of killing Jews since the Holocaust. This 
is why their narrative is changing.
  Now, it is like: But the President of Iran hasn't asked for the money 
yet. And by the way, it is frozen.
  Then why did you transfer it to the Doha Bank account?

[[Page H6005]]

  Mr. Chairman, I will tell you why. It is because Iran requested it. 
The idea that Iran is not going to ask for this money, I have to say, 
with all due respect, is incredulous. Of course, they want this money.
  The question is: Why hasn't it been transferred already?
  Do you know what, Mr. Chairman? The answer is October 7. That is why 
it hasn't been transferred. They got caught with their pants down. Now, 
they realize: Oh, my God, we can't transfer this money. Think of the 
optics here. This is going to look really bad.
  There is another thing that is very nefarious going on here. There is 
some deal going on, Mr. Chairman, that we don't know about, and we have 
every right of oversight. They won't call things treaties because the 
Senate won't confirm them. They call them deals.
  What is going on? It is not just about the hostages, and thank God 
they are home. Let me tell the families: God bless them.
  Nevertheless, there is something else going on here. There is an 
undercurrent of another deal going on, and it is the JCPOA, the Iran 
nuclear agreement. That is why the money was transferred. In my 
judgment, it is to facilitate another deal with Iran.
  The irony of all ironies, Mr. Chairman, is the Special Envoy for Iran 
is now under investigation by the FBI for violations of his security 
clearance. The very man negotiating the JCPOA, the Iran deal, is under 
investigation by the FBI for violating his national security clearance.
  You can't make this up, Mr. Chairman. You really can't make this up.
  He talked about the Presidential waiver. We said that the whole point 
of this bill is to ensure they cannot use the $6 billion unless they do 
two things: one, cease their support for international terrorism, and, 
two, stop their nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction 
programs.
  This bill doesn't undercut our leverage; it turns this money into 
leverage to stop their most dangerous activities.
  I think this is a bad deal. I think that the underlying intent is 
something more secretive.
  Mr. Chairman, I have to ask the question: Has any Member of Congress 
seen this deal that we are talking about? Has the gentleman from New 
York seen this hostage deal with Iran?
  I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it, classified or not. Where is the 
deal? Why won't the administration present the deal to the Congress 
pursuant to our oversight responsibilities?
  That is transparency. That is why we introduced the bill because 
Congress has every right on behalf of the American people, before the 
$6 billion was transferred into Iran, to see what the deal is.
  We met with these hostage families yesterday, and it is brutal. I was 
in the kibbutz at the Gaza border in southern Israel, Kfar Azza. They 
went into the daycare center and killed the children I saw there. They 
decapitated them, and they killed everybody I met in the kibbutz.
  I can't look at these families of the victims or the families of the 
hostages in good faith. I cannot look them in the eye and say: Do you 
know what? I support your efforts to get your loved ones home. But 
guess what? I also support this deal that the President has decided to 
do to put $6 billion into the Islamic Republic of Iran, the largest 
state sponsor of terror and the very country responsible for the Hamas 
attacks killing more Jews than I have seen in my lifetime.
  My father was a bombardier on a B-17 in World War II. He bombed the 
Nazis. He saw the Holocaust in his lifetime. I never thought I would 
see anything like that in my lifetime, but guess what, Mr. Chairman? 
This is the largest killing since the Holocaust.
  I can't look those families in the eye, Mr. Chairman, and tell them 
that I am going to support this deal to add additional money for 
terrorism, especially $6 billion.
  This is not about the five Americans. We released five Iranians 
guilty of espionage, in my judgment. This is about the undercurrent of 
a deal that we don't know about. They are secretive about it, and they 
need to come forward to the American people through the Congress and 
let us know what that deal was.
  Nevertheless, I, for one, will not sit here in this Chamber and allow 
this to happen. That is why if they won't do it, then we will. Congress 
will stop this money from going into Iran not just for politics and not 
even for the American people but for the victims of terrorism around 
the world, especially the people of Israel.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Valadao). All time for general debate has 
expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs, printed in the bill, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 118-14, modified by the amendment printed in part B of House 
Report 118-280, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, 
shall be considered as an original bill for purpose of further 
amendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered as read.
  The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as 
follows:

                               H.R. 5961

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``No Funds for Iranian 
     Terrorism Act''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) On October 7, 2023, Iran-backed Hamas terrorists 
     launched a massive, unprovoked war on Israel by air, land, 
     and sea, in which they engaged in the brutal murder of over 
     1,300 people and kidnapped 130 people who are now being held 
     hostage.
       (2) Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah have 
     all been designated by the United States as Foreign Terrorist 
     Organizations pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and 
     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189).
       (3) According to an unclassified United States government 
     assessment, ``Iran has historically provided up to $100 
     million annually in combined support to Palestinian terrorist 
     groups, including Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and 
     the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
     Command.''.
       (4) As National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated on 
     October 10, 2023, ``Iran is complicit in this attack in a 
     broad sense because they have provided the lion's share of 
     the funding for the military wing of Hamas, they have 
     provided training, they have provided capabilities, they have 
     provided support, and they have provided engagement and 
     contact with Hamas over years and years.''.
       (5) President Biden reached an agreement with the Iranian 
     regime to bring home Siamak Namazi, Morad Tahbaz, Emad 
     Shargi, and two additional American hostages all of whom were 
     wrongfully detained in Iran.

               Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Fitzpatrick

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in part C of Report 118-280.
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 1, after line 15, insert the following:
       (3) Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and associated 
     terrorist organizations backed by Iran routinely and 
     unabashedly use civilians as ``human shields'' to shield 
     their weapons and terrorist militants from legitimate 
     military engagement, a contravention of international 
     humanitarian law and a heinous violation of the rights and 
     dignity of civilian noncombatants.
       (4) Only the cessation of Hamas' operations, the 
     unconditional surrender of Hamas, and the immediate 
     dismantlement of Hamas and all other Iran-backed terrorist 
     organizations that participated in the massacre of Israelis 
     on and since October 7, 2023, will ensure that innocent 
     Israeli and Palestinian civilian lives are saved.

from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in favor of my amendment to H.R. 5961, the 
No Funds for Iranian Terrorism Act.
  Mr. Chair, this Congress has a responsibility to unequivocally 
denounce the cruelty and inhumanity perpetrated by the terrorist 
organizations funded by Iran, especially Hamas.
  As we work to prohibit further funds from being used by the ruthless 
Iranian regime to prop up terrorists and subsidize terror attacks, we 
must also ensure that we swiftly and clearly condemn the criminal acts 
already carried out by Iran's agents of terror.
  The deliberate use of innocent civilians as humanitarian 
infrastructure by Hamas and other Iran-backed terrorist groups to 
shield themselves, their weapons, and their operations is entirely 
unconscionable.
  Their unabashed and irredeemable disregard for human life is equally 
outrageous. Hamas and other terrorist organizations are placing 
innocent, noncombatant women, children, elderly, and other vulnerable 
individuals in harm's way. This must stop.
  This is a blatant contravention of international humanitarian law.
  Beyond all of that, Mr. Chair, it is a fundamental violation of human 
dignity.
  My amendment ensures that the United States emphatically condemns 
these actions of Iran-backed terrorist organizations. It further 
demands the immediate and unconditional surrender of Hamas and other 
terrorist organizations so that innocent civilian lives may be saved in 
both Israel and Palestine.
  This has not and should not be a partisan issue. This Congress and 
this government must continue to be united in our condemnation of 
terror and terrorists.
  Anything less is a betrayal of our obligation as a global leader for 
human rights, human dignity, and human freedom.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of my amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
will be postponed.


          Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 
printed in part C of House Report 118-280.
  Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Redesignate section 4 as section 5.
       Insert after section 3 the following:

     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that the terrorist-funding, 
     human rights-violating Iranian regime should receive no 
     additional funds but that basic humanitarian assistance for 
     the people of Iran is important.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.
  Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment.
  I am offering my amendment to H.R. 5961 to reaffirm what I hope 
should be a bipartisan principle: Our problem lies with the Iranian 
regime, not the Iranian people.
  Innocent Iranians have suffered at the hands of cruel authoritarian 
leaders who have zero regard for human rights. The Ayatollah and his 
regime have racked up a laundry list of gross abuses.
  Iranian security forces and prison personnel torture and sexually 
assault detainees. The country sees staggering levels of repression, 
without any room for peaceful dissent. Iranian authorities disable the 
internet during protests to mask their human rights violations. Women 
and girls are treated as second-class citizens and without any form of 
basic dignity.
  We must cut off any source of funding for the terrorist-supporting, 
human rights-violating Iranian regime, but not at the expense of basic 
humanitarian assistance. The Iranian people are suffering enough. Any 
attempt to restrain the flow of aid would exacerbate this pain.
  Let me also emphasize that there are robust safeguards on the funds 
currently in Qatar.

[[Page H6007]]

  First, the Biden administration has made it abundantly clear that the 
funds are going nowhere anytime soon. There are guardrails to ensure 
that food and medicine and similar goods alone can be purchased. No 
other transactions will be approved. Iran does not have access to this 
money currently, nor will they in the future. They can only contract 
with third-party suppliers to receive the goods. Those suppliers will 
work with financial institutions to process the payments.
  In other words, it is humanitarian aid or nothing at all.
  My amendment emphasizes that we should support humanitarian aid for 
the Iranian people. All of us can take issue with Iran's tyrannical 
leaders, but we cannot penalize Iranian citizens who have been forced 
to endure a harsh and repressive regime.
  A threat to the Iranian people is a threat to all of us. As 
Americans, we must uphold our responsibility as world leaders and stand 
with the Iranian people.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and remember 
that the duality of our great leadership is in our strength and our 
compassion and not in further exacerbating any pain or oppression but 
in ensuring that we stand as world leaders and support humanitarian aid 
while continuing to fight the authoritarian regime.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1330

  Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York, Ranking Member Meeks.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I strongly support this amendment.
  The United States must stand for humanitarian aid and must stand for 
helping the people of Iran, even while we condemn the Iranian governing 
regime. The regime's medieval views on women's rights and religious 
freedom and their depraved agenda of financing terrorists around the 
region are separate from the people of Iran.
  This amendment simply separates the government from the people, and I 
encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this very good and 
humanitarian amendment.
  Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Chair, I close by encouraging all of my 
colleagues to vote in support of this amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick).
  The amendment was agreed to.


               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Gottheimer

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 
printed in part C of House Report 118-280.
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 1, line 10, strike ``130 people'' and insert ``at 
     least 230 people''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer) and a Member opposed each will control 
5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to correct the 
number of hostages that Hamas terrorists took when they attacked Israel 
on October 7. It was the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the 
Holocaust.
  That day, Hamas terrorists brutally murdered, raped, burned alive, 
and decapitated more than a thousand innocent babies, children, women, 
men, and elderly, including dozens of Americans.
  Let me be very clear: More than 230 people were abducted and taken 
hostage by Hamas, a terrorist organization, including nearly a dozen 
Americans. Again, Americans were killed. Americans remain hostage.
  There are some people who equivocate about Hamas, a foreign terrorist 
organization. There should be no equivocation. They are designated by 
the United States of America as a foreign terrorist organization. They 
are terrorists, and anybody who spent time looking at images of the 
barbaric, heinous, and unthinkable acts that took place on October 7, 
like I have, knows what Hamas is capable of. We will never unsee it. I 
know the ranking member was there, as well, and has seen it.
  We cannot forget that Hamas is an evil terrorist organization. Their 
charter advocates jihad against the Jewish people and the destruction 
of the Jewish state.
  In the region, militarily, beyond their support for Hamas, Iran is 
backing proxies that have attacked American troops in Iraq and Syria. 
We have seen an uptick in skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israel near 
the Lebanese border.
  President Biden has been phenomenal with his resolve and unwavering 
support for our key ally Israel, which is critical to America's 
national security and the fight against terror and is the democracy in 
the region.
  The President has taken action in Syria in response to attacks by 
Iranian-backed proxies on American personnel, regular attacks. We have 
seen them in Syria. We have seen it in Iraq. We have seen it from the 
Houthis.
  The President understands that you have to actually hold terrorists 
who commit atrocities against our country accountable, or they will 
strike again and be stronger. Hamas terrorists, their leadership, have 
even made it clear that they will not back down and are committed to 
``a second, third, and fourth'' October 7 against Israel.
  The President has continued to demonstrate strength, resolve, and 
leadership to get hostages home. Thankfully, in recent days, groups of 
hostages have been rescued, including 4 year old Abigail, an American 
citizen.
  As of today, there are still nearly 160 hostages, including 
Americans. Forty American citizens were slaughtered by Hamas, and other 
terrorists have been living in horrifying fear and uncertainty at the 
hands of terrorists for more than 50 days. It blows my mind that this 
isn't talked about every single day in our country that Americans 
remain hostage.
  Americans were killed and are still suffering in Gaza. May all their 
memories be a blessing.
  This should be the beginning and end of the argument of why we must 
crush Hamas and stop Iranian-backed terrorist proxies. These terrorists 
continue to attack Israel and American personnel around the globe.
  The names and ages of the Americans still held hostage by the 
terrorists in Gaza are as follows: Gad Haggai, 73 years old; Judith 
Weinstein, 70 years old; Keith Samuel Siegel, 64 years old; Sagui 
Dekel-Chen, 35 years old; Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23 years old; Omer 
Neutra, 22 years old; Itay Chen, 19 years old.
  The eighth American still held hostage is 19-year-old Edan Alexander 
from Tenafly, New Jersey, in my district. Here is Edan. He is a 
wonderful, wonderful person. I have met with his family. They are 
phenomenal.
  After Edan graduated from Tenafly High School in 2022, he began 
serving with the Israel Defense Forces. He grew up in northern New 
Jersey, became a swimmer, and went to the prom. I have seen all the 
photos.
  Since day one, I have been in constant contact with the Alexander 
family. Their unimaginable strength in the face of unfathomable pain 
gives all of us hope. I don't know how they do it.
  It is time to get our Americans and all of the hostages home. It is 
in America's interest and critical to our national security to ensure 
that October 7 can never and must never happen again. Our objectives 
are clear: to stand by Israel, our key ally, the democracy in the 
region, our partner in the fight against terror; to get all of the 
Americans and all the hostages home; to crush the terrorists and 
provide much-needed humanitarian aid to innocent Palestinian civilians 
being used by Hamas as human shields.
  Mr. Chair, you will notice that Hamas does not allow any of the 
innocent Palestinians to go underground to be protected. There is no 
protection for them. They use them as human shields. Israel must 
eliminate every single terrorist responsible from Hamas for the 
atrocities committed on October 7.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).
  The amendment was agreed to.

                 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Norman

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 
printed in part C of House Report 118-280.
  Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Page 4, line 6, after ``committees'' insert ``not later 
     than 45 days before the termination of such sanctions''.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. Norman) and a Member opposed each will control 
5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.
  Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Chair, what my amendment does is allow a 45-day 
waiting period between certification and removal of sanctions.
  I heard my good friend, Mr. Gottheimer, mention how this 
administration is the best friend Israel has. If that is the case, why 
is he wanting to give $6 billion to Iran which is the sponsor of 
terror? If he is so interested in protecting Americans, why does he 
have our border wide open for people to come illegally from every 
country around the world?
  This amendment is in response to an administration that has done 
anything but be on the side of Israel.
  Mr. Chair, I applaud the work of Chairman McCaul and the Foreign 
Affairs Committee for this commonsense legislation that effectively 
freezes the $6 billion of Iranian funds by imposing immediate and 
mandatory sanctions on financial institutions attempting to engage in 
transactions with these funds.
  Despite claims by the administration to the contrary, the $6 billion 
handed over to Iran by the Biden administration--to the country that is 
the leading sponsor of terror that has taken all of the hostages in 
that he shows pictures of--this money is fungible and Iran is complicit 
in the attacks launched on October 7 that killed close to 1,500 
innocent people, some of which were at a music festival.
  I wholeheartedly support this legislation. However, I have one 
concern. Section 3 of this legislation contains language that allows 
President Biden to terminate sanctions if the President simply 
certifies in writing that Iran no longer provides support for terrorism 
and has ceased the development of nuclear weapons.
  This President simply will not do that. That is why he is letting the 
money go.
  As currently written, this legislation provides no opportunity for 
Congress to exercise oversight. The President can simply terminate 
sanctions if he thinks Iran meets certain requirements.
  In September 2023, the Biden administration waived sanctions to allow 
the $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korean banks to be transferred 
to banks in Qatar in exchange for the release of five hostages.
  No matter what the Biden administration says, money is fungible. This 
deal gave Iran access to more money to fund its terrorist activities, 
including support for regional proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah.
  Just 1 month after this deal, Hamas launched its brutal attack on 
Israel, killing innocent civilians and taking dozens of hostages. We 
have seen what happens when we give too much authority to this 
executive branch. Their actions speak louder than their words. I don't 
want this to happen again.
  This is why my amendment would require a 45-day waiting period 
between Presidential certification and removal of sanctions to provide 
an opportunity for congressional oversight. The President shouldn't be 
doing this anyway. To not have a 45-day waiting period to try to 
correct and let Congress deal with what his actions are is 
incomprehensible to me.
  Mr. Chair, in closing, let me say I named some things that this 
President is doing. The purpose of my amendment is because of the $6 
billion that is going to the leading sponsor of terror that the Biden 
administration is okaying.
  I will add another thing that has not been widely publicized. We have 
a sitting Member of Congress, Cory Mills, from Florida, who had to 
charter his own airplane to rescue hostages. When he contacted the 
Biden administration for support, they gave him no support. The Biden 
administration gave no support to rescue the hostages. The pictures 
were shown by my good friend, Josh Gottheimer. This is a wayward 
administration that is lawless.
  This amendment simply builds in additional time for Congress to 
conduct proper oversight of executive branch certifications. We should 
not continue to further delegate legislative authority derived from 
Article I of the Constitution to the executive branch.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman).
  The amendment was agreed to.


                  Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Ogles

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 
printed in part C of House Report 118-280.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end the following:

     SEC. _. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that all United States allies 
     in the Middle East should publicly and unequivocally condemn 
     the antisemitism displayed by Iranian-backed terrorist 
     groups, including Hamas.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, the unprovoked assault on Israel on October 7 
shocked millions around the world and demonstrated the unrelenting 
brutality of Hamas.
  While many countries around the world supported Israel as it 
confronted this single deadliest day for the Jews since the Holocaust, 
many did not. Many of the countries that pointedly refused to condemn 
Hamas are located in the Middle East.
  Mr. Chairman, my amendment expresses a sense of Congress that all 
U.S. allies in the Middle East should publicly and unequivocally 
condemn the anti-Semitism displayed by the Iranian-backed terror 
groups, including Hamas.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1345

  Mr. Chairman, Kuwait, a country that American soldiers liberated from 
Saddam Hussein, expressed its grave concern and blamed Israel for the 
blatant attacks. Kuwait further urged the international community to 
stop the provocative practices by the occupation.
  Talk about victim blaming, Mr. Chairman, especially when the guilty 
party, Hamas, has proudly taken responsibility for attacking and raping 
Jewish civilians.
  Lebanon, a country which at this point is effectively controlled by 
the terrorist group Hezbollah, congratulated the resisting Palestinian 
people. Hezbollah hailed Hamas for its large-scale heroic operation, an 
operation that saw an 8-year-old girl have her hands cut off and then 
being left to bleed to death.
  Tunisia declared its full and unconditional solidarity with the 
Palestinian people following Hamas' brutality on October 7, an attack 
that saw a pregnant woman have her mouth duct-taped and her baby cut 
out of her stomach. In no uncertain terms, the country, a listed major 
non-NATO ally, maintained their position to fully stand by the 
Palestinian people until they recover their entire land.
  Qatar, a country whose state-controlled media outlet, Al Jazeera, 
which should also be known as the Qatari news network, is the 
mouthpiece of Hamas terrorists and blamed Israel for being solely 
responsible for the ongoing escalation and stressed their unwavering 
stance on the justice of the Palestinian cause and for the 
international community to compel Israel to cease its blatant violation 
of international law. These attacks saw women bound, gang-raped, and 
then murdered, attacks that saw a baby put in an oven and baked alive, 
the father's eyes gouged out and the mother raped.

[[Page H6009]]

  On November 1, the Kingdom of Jordan, a country which was given well 
over half a billion in taxpayer dollars in this last year's omnibus, 
recalled its Ambassador to Israel.
  Other countries, including Oman, Turkiye, and Egypt, choose to 
equivocate instead of condemning Hamas.
  Wherever you are on the political spectrum, the attack was inhumane. 
It was brutal. It was blatant, and those culpable should be punished.
  The international community, including many of the Arab states that I 
have mentioned, should join with the international community in 
condemning Hamas and should speak for the innocent.
  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

                  Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Ogles

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 
printed in part C of House Report 118-280.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end the following:

     SEC. _. PROHIBITION ON FUNDS.

       No federal funds may be used to make any funds (as such 
     term is defined in section 2339C(e)(1) of title 18, United 
     States Code) available to Iran.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chairman, most Americans would be surprised and 
disgusted to learn that Iran has been given approximately $50 billion 
in a sanctions relief package by the Biden administration.
  More to the point, it was done in exchange for a promise from Iran 
that they wouldn't produce weapons-grade uranium. That is it. That is 
all we apparently got.
  Think about the implications of this deal. The Ayatollah, who 
embraces chants of ``Death to America'' and ``Death to Israel,'' can 
produce even more deadly long-range missiles, but that is fine by Joe 
Biden. How about highly enriched uranium? Somewhere in Foggy Bottom, 
Antony Blinken is nodding his head: Sure, why not?
  The Ayatollah can put his country on the cusp of the nuclear 
threshold and hold it over us as a constant threat. He can continue to 
pocket billions of taxpayer dollars made available by the so-called 
adults in charge at our State Department.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is counterproductive. The 
House has voted in a bipartisan manner to support general licenses to 
Iran to allow open internet access to the protesters against the regime 
of Iran. That could violate this vaguely drafted amendment. In the 
recent past, the United States has spent very small sums of money to 
promote civil society and democratic ideals in Iran, and that could 
violate this amendment.
  This amendment, I believe, with all due respect, is carelessly 
drafted and unvetted. Therefore, I must oppose it.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, civil. On October 7, Iran sponsored the murder, 
rape, and torture of innocent civilians.
  Civil. I do not trust Iran with nuclear material.
  Civil. They raped little girls.
  Civil. I should think not.
  This is a no-brainer, Mr. Chairman. This administration--whether due 
to side deals, incompetence, or just selling out America--is bringing 
the world's most grievous, grotesque sponsor of state terrorism closer 
to nuclear capabilities.
  Mr. Chairman, I am from the South. You can put lipstick on a pig, but 
it is still a pig.
  Iran should be punished for what happened in Israel. Hamas should be 
driven into the sea. Respectfully to my colleague, we should take 
extraordinary measures to send a message to the world that this will 
never happen again.
  Iran must pay and pay dearly. This is but a first step.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chairman, the world is in a precarious place. We see 
the CCP making moves in the Pacific against Taiwan. Russia has made a 
move against Ukraine. Iranian-backed terrorists killed innocent 
civilians.
  There should be no relief for Iran. There should be no sanctions 
relief for Iran, for they are not civil. They do not belong at a seat 
at the table with the rest of the world. They need to be driven into 
the stone age, where they belong and how they behave.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles).

                  Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Ogles

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 
printed in part C of House Report 118-280.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end the following:

     SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON QATAR.

       It is the sense of Congress that the Government of Qatar 
     should publicly condemn Hamas, turn Hamas leadership over the 
     United States or Israeli control, and pledge never to 
     facilitate the transfer of any covered Iranian funds to Iran 
     or any agency or instrumentality of Iran.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chairman, while Hamas terrorists were brutalizing 
Israeli citizens, Hamas' top leadership was celebrating from a 
penthouse in Doha.
  Qatar claims to be our ally. They want to hold a special place with 
the United States. We have a forward operating base there.
  While they are claiming to be our friend, they are literally housing, 
aiding, and abetting terrorists from Hamas, roughly a dozen who are 
worth billions, flying on private jets, drinking champagne, and 
partying while Israeli citizens are being slaughtered.
  Qatar has the opportunity to stand with the United States, stand with 
the innocent people of Israel who were murdered.
  This sense of Congress simply urges that Qatar should condemn Hamas, 
turn over Hamas leadership to U.S. and Israeli custody, and pledge 
never to facilitate the transfer of covered Iranian funds to Iran.
  Mr. Chairman, there is a direct link between the money that was wired 
to Doha and terrorism. Iran has said they will use the money however 
they see fit. It is time for our allies or so-called allies to be our 
allies.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment targets Qatar, the most

[[Page H6010]]

important partner of the United States in freeing Americans and 
Israelis held hostage by Hamas.
  Passage of this amendment and, in my opinion, this overall bill would 
jeopardize sensitive, ongoing diplomacy related to the hostage crisis 
in Gaza and further endanger Americans and Israelis in harm's way. 
Israel's National Security Adviser publicly praised Qatar's role as 
crucial to ongoing efforts to facilitate humanitarian solutions.
  Furthermore, it was reported in late October that Qatar's Emir told 
Secretary of State Blinken that his government was open to 
reconsidering the presence of Hamas in Qatar once the hostage crisis is 
resolved.
  I agree that Hamas' continued presence in Qatar and Turkiye is 
problematic. These terrorist leaders are living a life of luxury while 
their people suffer in Gaza. They should be held accountable, but this 
is not the way to go about it.
  Let's free our hostages. Then, we can talk and work with Qatar to 
hold Hamas' leadership in Doha accountable.
  This amendment is simply grandstanding and not the best way to deal 
with this issue, and certainly, it is being offered at the worst 
possible time.

                              {time}  1400

  Diplomacy is very important. If we challenge or damage these 
diplomatic channels, it further endangers Americans.
  We can't pass this legislation. We should not pass this legislation. 
I ask my colleagues to please join me in voting ``no'' on this 
amendment. We shouldn't even need the bill.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chairman, a thief that robs your house, then 2 days 
later mows your lawn, is still a thief. A country that houses 
terrorists is still an accomplice. It is a fact.
  While they are giving over or assisting with the release of the 
hostages, they have the opportunity to give over the Hamas leaders who 
planned and orchestrated the attack, but will they do it? Of course 
not, because they are guilty.
  Qatar reportedly gives Hamas between $360 million and $480 million 
per year. To my friend, I wonder how many of those dollars from Qatar 
given to Hamas bought bullets, bought antitank mines, paid for the 
training of the soldiers that raped children.
  I wonder how many of those millions of dollars built the training 
camps in Gaza. When the militants, the terrorists went in, they were 
well armed. They were well trained. I wonder how many of the millions 
of dollars Qatar gave Hamas to pay for that. Al Jazeera, the terrorist 
news network, has praised the attack. It is controlled by Qatar.
  If my child or children that I love stick their hand in the cookie 
jar, just because I love them doesn't mean that they will escape 
punishment.
  Qatar may claim to be our friend, but they just got caught with their 
hand in the cookie jar, and perhaps they should be punished.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Gooden).
  Mr. GOODEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the spirit of this 
amendment. I appreciate my colleague. I appreciate this bill, which I 
am supporting. I agree that Hamas is a terrorist organization, and I 
want nothing more than for them to be taken down.
  What I have not heard from my colleague within my party is all the 
good that has happened thanks to Qatar's efforts in the last few weeks.
  There is a whole lot of bad to talk about, but I didn't hear anything 
about the hostage negotiations that would not be happening without the 
people of Qatar, without the leadership there. I thank the Qatari 
leadership for helping us get those hostages out.
  A couple weeks ago, I had a family member of a 12-year-old boy in my 
office that said, Congressman, will you do anything you can? We are 
trying to get these hostages out. The people of Israel want them out, 
and we are not making any progress. What can you do?
  You know what I did? I went down to the Qatari Embassy. I sent 
someone down and said, I want to speak to you guys. We need some 
action. We need more efforts. We need more results.
  In the last week, what we have seen are hostages coming out of the 
Gaza strip.
  Now, there are those that say we shouldn't negotiate with terrorists. 
The people of Israel--and I defer to the Israelis on this matter 
because they are the ones living among these folks. They are saying 
they want these hostages back. They are saying they want to work with 
the Qataris in bringing them back. They have thanked them for their 
efforts.
  The other thing I haven't heard from my colleague within my party--
and frankly, I am disappointed some of my colleagues within my party 
have not spoken up against this amendment in particular--is about the 
great, fantastic United States Air Force base that we have in Qatar.
  If they are such accomplices to terror, if they are such bad folks 
over there running the Qatari Government, why do we have an Air Force 
base there?
  This amendment is badly timed.
  I agree with the concepts in this amendment. I agree that I would 
love everyone on Earth to condemn Hamas.
  This amendment right now does not help us achieve our goal, and that 
is to bring these hostages back. That is what our friends in Israel 
want. They want these hostages back.
  If you don't want these hostages back, if you don't want a United 
States Air Force presence over in the Middle East, then go ahead and 
vote for this amendment.
  What you are saying to the Qataris is we want you to cease efforts. 
We want you to turn over whoever it is that you have that you are 
negotiating with.
  By the way, the American Government, we are the ones that asked them 
to keep this channel open with Hamas. We are the ones, the United 
States, that said Hamas needs to be close and able to be accessible.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Texas.
  Mr. GOODEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, I ask colleagues and staffers that 
are watching this amendment debate back in the office to go back to 
your boss, especially if you are Republican, and say, you know what? We 
have a Member from our own party saying this is a bad idea because we 
have hostage negotiations that are happening right now that will not be 
helped if this amendment is passed.
  Everyone in this Chamber knows this amendment is going nowhere if it 
gets on the bill, but that doesn't matter.
  The concept of giving the middle finger to the one group in the 
Middle East that is actually helping us achieve some hostage releases, 
and that is the Qataris, I think is a bad policy, and I urge opposition 
to this amendment.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, with respect to Qatar's recent activities on 
the world stage, I will just say this: Qatar should not get a pass 
whenever it decides to stop playing law breaker in order to start 
playing first responder.

  I think it is a misnomer to think that without Qatar, that somehow 
negotiations wouldn't take place. The reality of the situation on the 
ground is the reason why Hamas is negotiating, because Israel is 
kicking their butt and is going to continue to do so. These 
negotiations would happen with or without Qatar.
  Qatar benefits from our Air Force base there.
  If my colleague from my own party thinks giving money to Qatar so 
that Hamas can rape little girls, then that is his choice, not mine.
  You can't pretend to be our friend when you are funding an 
organization that attacks and brutalizes innocent civilians. You can't 
have it both ways. It just doesn't work that way. You can't have your 
network praising the attacks.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I will just simply say, very briefly, when you 
hear from Israel, its leaders, Israel's national security advisor 
publicly praising Qatar's role as crucial, and when I visited Israel 
and talked to the head of their defense, talked to Prime Minister

[[Page H6011]]

Netanyahu, all said that Qatar was crucial to this negotiation.
  Let's not do this. It is the wrong time.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Moolenaar). The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles).
  The amendment was agreed to.


                  Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Ogles

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 
printed in part C of House Report 118-280.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end the following:

     SEC. _. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE HOUTHIS.

       It is the sense of Congress that the Houthis, an Iran-
     backed terrorist group which has hijacked a Japanese-operated 
     cargo ship, kidnapped and tortured United States citizens, 
     and supports Hamas' ongoing war against Israel, continues to 
     benefit from the Biden Administration's failure to 
     unequivocally condemn it.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chairman, if I were to describe to you a group that 
has just seized a cargo ship and what Israel has since referred to as 
an Iranian act of terrorism, you might come to the conclusion that 
perpetrators can't distinguish between civilians and military targets.
  If I were to also tell you that the same group just earlier this week 
shot two ballistic missiles at a U.S. warship, you might come to the 
conclusion that these perpetrators are the enemies of the United 
States.
  Finally, if I told you that this group is guilty of kidnapping and 
torturing U.S. citizens, you might come to the conclusion that we need 
to wipe these people off the face of the Earth.
  You might think that the Biden administration would agree, but 
apparently it does not, and that is to the detriment of our national 
security.
  This is a sense of Congress that the Houthis continue to benefit from 
the Biden administration's unwillingness to unequivocally condemn.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I rise to claim the time in opposition.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, this amendment is needless and simply not 
rooted in fact. The sponsor bases his claims for this amendment on the 
assertion that the administration has not condemned Houthi militants 
for their violent actions and continued destabilizing behavior. This 
simply is not accurate.
  The Biden administration has repeatedly called out the violence of 
Houthi militants that they have perpetuated against civilians, 
including recent missile launches toward Israel, as well as our Gulf 
partners.
  In fact, as recently as this past Tuesday, November 28, the State 
Department called out the violence of Iranian proxies across the region 
as well, and especially called on the Houthis to immediately cease 
attacks.
  The United States led other G-7 nations in this public effort, which 
follows other similar statements. These statements include the State 
Department's condemnation of Houthi militants seizing the cargo ship 
Galaxy Leader on November 20.
  Spokesperson Matt Miller called such actions flagrant violations of 
international law and demanded the immediate release of the ship and 
its crew.
  The administration made similar statements earlier this year and 
last, calling out Houthi abuses against Yemeni civilians, missile 
launches against Gulf partners, and more.
  I, along with many of my colleagues, have and will continue to call 
out abuses, escalatory actions, and violence throughout the region, 
just as the administration has.
  This amendment is an unnecessary and ill-conceived attempt to 
misrepresent the facts, so I must oppose it, and I encourage all of my 
colleagues to do so as well.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).
  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding. I 
support his amendment, and I support the underlying bill.
  Mr. Chairman, if you look at this piece of legislation, both the bill 
and the underlying amendment, if you go back to when this $6 billion 
swap for $6 billion in cash was initially negotiated earlier this year, 
many could argue, me included, that it was an ill-advised negotiation 
back then, and this was prior to the invasion of Israel by Hamas.
  I think it is important to understand the context. Everybody in the 
world knows that Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of 
terrorism, including funding Hamas.
  The idea that you can just take Hamas and keep it separate from Iran 
has always been a farce. Iran funds Hamas, and everybody knows it.
  The idea that you would be negotiating in August or September to help 
Iran get $6 billion boggles the mind prior to the invasion and attacks 
on Israel. After the attacks, the administration should be joining us 
in supporting this bill.

                              {time}  1415

  The administration should be standing there saying: We are not giving 
them the money anymore.
  Who is the money going to? The President of Iran has already told you 
what he is going to do with the $6 billion.
  You have the Biden administration saying, don't worry, it is all 
about humanitarian aid. The problem is that the people that are getting 
the $6 billion aren't saying that.
  Mr. Chairman, the President of Iran himself went on TV, 60 Minutes, 
and said: This money belongs to the Islamic Republic of Iran. And 
naturally, we will decide, the Islamic Republic of Iran will decide, to 
spend it wherever we need it.
  They can give it to Hamas tomorrow if they got this money, and the 
President of Iran said so.
  I don't care what John Kerry says when he flies around over there, or 
what Joe Biden might even say. Once the President of Iran gets the $6 
billion, it is his money, and he said he is going to do whatever he 
wants with it.
  Why would we give it to him today? We shouldn't have even thought 
about giving it to him prior to the attacks by Hamas in October. We 
surely shouldn't be thinking about it today.
  Thank goodness in this House we are going to take a vote, and we are 
going to pass this bill. Hopefully, it is an overwhelming bipartisan 
vote to send it to the Senate and help wake up our Senate friends to 
say that this is a position that we should be vocal on, as they still 
haven't figured out what to do with funding for Iran.
  We passed a bipartisan bill to help Israel get the funding that they 
need to push back on the attacks, to go get more hostages, as we are 
seeing.
  We are hearing senators talking about a permanent cease-fire, or more 
conditions. We ought to be all coming together to support Israel on 
whatever tools they need.
  This House has been vocal in a pretty bipartisan way almost every 
step of the way to do that. Today can be another one of those moments 
where we don't just stand up to Hamas, but we stand up to the group who 
funds Hamas, as well.
  Everybody knows who funds Hamas. It is Iran; $6 billion going to the 
President, who said he is going to take the money for whatever purposes 
he wants.
  They shouldn't get the money. Let's keep it.
  Let's continue to support our great ally in that region at the time 
they need it the most. We will be there with Israel every step of the 
way, with all the tools they need to be successful at destroying this 
terrorist organization, Hamas, and anybody else who wants to join with 
them in helping embolden terrorism against the Jews, against the anti-
Semitism we see growing not just in the Middle East, but here in this 
country as well.
  We all ought to be vocal with one united voice against it. It is 
wrong. Let's stand with Israel. Let's stand with our friends, and let's 
stand against anybody who wants to support terrorism around the world.

[[Page H6012]]

  Let's pass this amendment, let's pass the bill, and let's get the 
Senate to put this bill on the President's desk.
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, let me just say this.
  Joe Biden has been one of the staunchest Israel supporters of any 
President of the United States.
  You are going to take the word of the Ayatollah over the word of the 
President of the United States?
  The President of the United States has said not a penny will get to 
the Ayatollah, but yet you want to take the side or believe in that 
brutal authoritarian dictator.
  I think that the American people know better than that. I think that 
the American people understand better than that. I think that the 
American people can look at the facts and see what side Joe Biden is 
on, as he talks on a regular basis with the leadership of Israel, 
almost every day since October 7.
  I wouldn't trust or believe anything that the Ayatollah says, but I 
do believe in Joe Biden.
  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ogles).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes

                 Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Pfluger

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 
printed in part C of House Report 118-280.
  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Redesignate section 4 as section 5.
       Insert after section 3 the following:

     SEC. 4. LIMITATION OF APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN LICENSES.

       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
     law, on and after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
     President may not--
       (1) exercise the waiver authority described in section 
     1245(d)(5) of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
     Fiscal Year 2012 and sections 1244(i) and 1247(f) of the Iran 
     Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 permitting the 
     Government of Iran or any Iranian person access to any 
     account established or maintained pursuant to or in 
     accordance with section 1245(d)(4)(D)(ii)(II) of the National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012; or
       (2) issue a general or specific license, frequently asked 
     question, or any other licensing action or guidance 
     permitting the Government of Iran or any Iranian person 
     access to or to benefit directly or indirectly from any

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Pfluger) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  On October 7, the world watched in horror as Hamas brutally attacked 
innocent civilians inside Israel, and I am glad to see that we have 
bipartisan agreement on standing with Israel, standing firm against 
Hamas.
  However, I have major concerns when it comes Iran. Iran, the world's 
largest state sponsor of terror globally, use fanaticism and extremism 
to stoke instability in the Middle East to expand their influence and 
threaten the existence of Israel and to threaten the United States. So 
far dozens and dozens of attacks since October 7 have been carried out 
at the behest of Iranian proxies in the Middle East toward U.S. troops.
  The only currency that is recognized by the Iranian regime is 
strength, something that the administration has not shown.
  This attack, and Israel's valid defense of its sovereignty in the 
wake of this barbaric invasion, is a wake-up call to the threats Iran-
backed terrorist groups pose, not just to the Middle East but also to 
the rest of the world. This is a watershed moment and it demands a 
resolute response.
  The United States must increase pressure on the Iranian regime by 
denying it the access to the funds abroad. Deterrence is the name of 
the game.
  In August and September of 2023, the Biden administration facilitated 
Tehran's access to $6 billion in oil revenues, sanctions that had 
previously been placed on Iran as a signal of strength, waivers that 
had been moved by the Biden administration.
  As currently written, in H.R. 5961 the only thing that is being 
frozen is the $6 billion of Iranian funds currently in Qatar. It does 
not freeze other Iranian-sanctioned funds, such as the sanctions waiver 
announced by the Biden administration last week which would allow Iraq 
to send $10 billion to Iran.
  The Founders intended us to have a system of checks and balances, and 
that is exactly what my amendment would do.
  My amendment would freeze all Iranian-sanctioned funds, not just the 
$6 billion in Qatar. Additionally, it would prohibit the President from 
using any sort of waiver authority, including licenses, guidance, or 
FAQs to lift the sanctions.
  As we have seen, we cannot trust this administration to hold fast, to 
have a strong deterrent policy, and to send the Iranian regime a strong 
signal.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York 
for 5 minutes.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would be counterproductive to 
America's interest.
  No President, whether he be Democratic or Republican, has used this 
waiver for anything but the most pressing reasons.
  Rescinding this waiver would likely prevent the administration from 
waiving sanctions that allow Iraq to pay for electricity imports from 
Iran. Without this waiver, Iraq likely will be unable to import 
electricity from Iran, leading to electricity outages and instability 
across Iraq.
  We have seen what instability in Iraq looks like over the past 
decade: the decay of central governance, the rise of ISIS, and a 
growing terrorist ideology that struck America and Europe in numerous 
deadly attacks.
  America has many interests in the Middle East, and this waiver is 
important for ensuring that this administration or any future 
administration has the flexibility it needs to promote American 
interests.
  It is important for the Presidents, this one and those in the future, 
to have that flexibility. Thereby, I oppose my good friend from Texas' 
amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Clyde), my good friend.
  Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of this 
amendment offered by my colleague from Texas, Representative Pfluger.
  It will strengthen H.R. 5961 by unequivocally blocking sanctioned 
Iranian funds from potentially being unfrozen and keeping these dollars 
out of the hands of the world's leading state sponsor of terror.
  This amendment will close troubling loopholes that allow President 
Biden to abuse waiver or license authorities to release billions in 
frozen Iranian assets.
  Enough is enough. We cannot continue policies that enrich Iran, 
embolden terrorists like Hamas, and put American troops in harm's way.
  Representative Pfluger's amendment also aligns with and reaffirms the 
goal of my bill, the Standing Against

[[Page H6013]]

Houthi Aggression Act, because the Houthis are also proxy terrorists 
for Iran.
  His amendment prevents Iranian funds from being used against our 
national security interests and limits President Biden's ability to 
circumvent Congressional oversight.
  Mr. Chair, I applaud Representative Pfluger for his work on this 
critical amendment, and as a cosponsor of it, I urge all Members to 
support it.
  We must stand united in stopping Iran from financing terrorists and 
in protecting American troops and allies abroad.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa 
(Mr. Nunn), my good friend and fellow Air Force veteran.
  Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Mr. Chair, I begin by thanking a fellow combat 
veteran for leading this effort to hold the terrorist group Hamas 
accountable by cutting off its number one funding source, that coming 
from Iran. This extends to Hezbollah, it extends to the IRGC, and 
it extends to Houthi rebels throughout the region.

  In the last week alone, we have seen attack after attack threatening 
American forces, including those of our friends still serving in 
uniform today.
  The effort that I am proud to co-lead with Congressman Pfluger 
highlights revoking Iran's funding act, an effort that the 
administration has taken a first step on--without a firm plan by 
Congress to prevent this waiver from going forward--which has time and 
time again been exploited by the President of Iran.
  The $20 billion that came out of the Turk Bank, the funding, 
illicitly, of money coming through on this side for frozen assets needs 
to be stopped.
  Congress must act. I applaud my friend for leading this charge, and I 
am proud to cosponsor it going forward.
  Mr. Chair, I urge the support of the entire body.
  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 30 seconds remaining.
  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Chair, the failed strategy of appeasement has not 
worked. Deterrence is what is needed.
  President Biden must reverse course on his policy toward Iran to stop 
terrorism from impacting us here. The system is blinking red.
  My amendment strengthens this bill. It puts deterrence at the 
forefront of the global stage. It restricts any money from going to 
Iran that they would use to foment terrorism and chaos throughout not 
only the Middle East but also here in our home.
  Mr. Chair, our Homeland Security depends on this amendment and 
depends on passage of this bill. I urge all of my colleagues across the 
aisle here on the Republican side to support this amendment and to pass 
this bill.
  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will 
be postponed.


                 Amendment No. 10 Offered by Ms. Porter

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 
printed in part C of House Report 118-280.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end the following:

     SEC. _. REPORT ON POLICY RELATING TO HUMAN RIGHTS, NUCLEAR 
                   PROLIFERATION, BALLISTIC MISSILES, AND REGIONAL 
                   TERRORISM IN IRAN.

       Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of 
     this Act, the President shall submit to Congress a report 
     (which may contain a classified annex) outlining the policy 
     of the United States with respect to human rights, nuclear 
     proliferation, the ballistic missile program, and regional 
     terrorism in Iran.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. Porter) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, the Iranian regime is a danger to 
international security and democratic order everywhere.
  The regime has funded terrorism across the Middle East for years, 
enabling groups like Hamas to attack Israel and commit other 
atrocities. The Iranian regime doesn't stop with supporting regional 
terrorism. It commits its own atrocities, consistently and brutally 
cracking down on its own citizens fighting for basic freedoms.

                              {time}  1430

  If all that weren't enough, the Iran regime further refuses to 
abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, putting the world at risk.
  Challenges like these require Congress to make policy that meets the 
moment, but we can only do that if Members of Congress and the people 
we represent can do oversight and fully understand our administration's 
policy toward Iran.
  Americans will benefit from more information on how our Nation is 
approaching preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and ending 
Iran's support for terrorist networks. Congress will also benefit from 
this information so that we can better legislate on Iran, consistent 
with the security interests and values of the United States.
  Under President Obama's administration, the United States Government 
issued periodic reports on its evolving policy in Syria. This set a 
model for the executive branch sharing information with lawmakers and 
the public regarding United States foreign policy toward countries of 
concern.
  In Congress, we know that the details of our Nation's Iran policy are 
complex and fluid, but precedent exists for our administration to 
provide a more complete window into its foreign policy objectives in 
specific countries.
  This bipartisan amendment would commission a detailed report on 
United States policy with regard to Iran with regard to human rights, 
nuclear proliferation, the ballistic missile program, and regional 
terrorism.
  We don't need talking heads force-feeding us conclusions about this 
administration's Iran policy. Let's get an oversight report about what 
that policy is and let everyone draw their own conclusions. Then, 
lawmakers on both sides of the aisle can better make policy that 
addresses the challenges we face operating from a shared platform of 
information.
  Mr. Chair, let's trust the American people and each other with 
information. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment, 
and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Porter).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California 
will be postponed.


                 Amendment No. 11 Offered by Ms. Porter

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 
printed in part C of House Report 118-280.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end the following:

     SEC. _. REPORT ON IRANIAN INTERNET CENSORSHIP.

       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury and the 
     Secretary of State shall jointly submit to Congress a report 
     regarding Iranian internet censorship and applicable United 
     States licensing requirements. Such report shall include the 
     following:
       (1) An assessment of the Iranian Government's ability to 
     impose internet shutdowns, censor the internet, and track 
     Iranian dissidents, labor organizers, political activists, or 
     human rights defenders inside Iran through targeted digital 
     surveillance or other digital means.
       (2) An assessment of the impact of General License D-2, 
     issued on September 23, 2022, on

[[Page H6014]]

     the availability of private communications tools inside Iran, 
     including encryption tools to assist the people of Iran in 
     circumventing targeted digital surveillance by the Iranian 
     Government.
       (3) A determination of whether additional updates to 
     General License D-2 or other licenses are needed to keep up 
     with the pace of technology and ensure that United States 
     restrictions do not unintentionally inhibit the flow of vital 
     communication tools to the people of Iran, including cloud 
     technology, hardware, software, and services incident to 
     personal communications, including set-top boxes (STB), 
     satellites, and web developer tools.
       (4) A strategy to ensure that resources are available for 
     digital rights experts to study Iran's online repression and 
     identify opportunities to counter it.
       (5) A strategy to prevent the Government of Iran from 
     acquiring or developing tools that could be exploited against 
     activists, including facial recognition software.
       (b) Form.--The report required pursuant to subsection (a) 
     shall be submitted in unclassified form but may include a 
     classified annex if such annex is provided separately from 
     such unclassified version.
       (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``targeted 
     digital surveillance'' means the use of items or services 
     that enable an individual or entity (with or without the 
     knowing authorization of the product's owner) to detect, 
     monitor, intercept, collect, exploit, preserve, protect, 
     transmit, retain, or otherwise gain access to the 
     communications, sensitive or protected information, work 
     product, browsing data, research, identifying information, 
     location history, or online or offline activities of other 
     individuals, organizations, or entities.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. Porter) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.
  Ms. PORTER. Mr. Chair, in Iran, we see a familiar pattern. Iranians 
are standing up, demanding change for themselves, their families, and 
their country. Then, the Iranian regime cracks down, arresting 
protesters and journalists and unleashing violence against its own 
people. Instead of giving its people the freedoms they seek, the regime 
limits freedoms, including restricting internet access.
  For authoritarian governments like the Iranian regime, restricting 
internet access couldn't be more crucial as a tool in repressing their 
own citizens. The internet is a portal to information about human 
rights, democratic order, economic prosperity, and thriving civil 
society. These things support freedom, and freedom is exactly the 
opposite of what the Iranian regime wants.
  To give Iranians a better future, we need to support them in having 
real access to the internet, and that means the internet without 
censorship, without digital surveillance, and without online 
repression. My amendment will help us do that.
  First, the amendment will require an assessment of the ways the 
Iranian Government shuts down, censors, and weaponizes the internet. 
Then, it will commission an assessment of whether United States policy 
is currently best supporting the flow of communication tools to the 
Iranian people.
  Finally, it will require the United States to develop strategies to 
counter Iran's online repression and prevent the Iranian regime from 
using tools of digital repression.
  Iranians have struggled for decades against threats to their basic 
freedoms. The more the Iranian people have tools like real internet 
access, the better position they will be in to fight the repression of 
the Iranian regime. That is why Members on both sides of the aisle who 
care deeply about creating a better future for the Iranian people have 
supported and collaborated with me on this amendment.
  Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. Porter).
  The amendment was agreed to.


          Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Jackson of Illinois

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 
printed in part C of House Report 118-280.
  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end the following:

     SEC. 5. SUNSET.

       This Act shall terminate on the date that is 5 years after 
     the date of the enactment of this Act.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 891, the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. Jackson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.
  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak on my 
amendment, amendment No. 12 to H.R. 5961, the No Funds for Iranian 
Terrorism Act.
  My amendment is simple. It adds a 5-year sunset provision. My 
amendment is in line with the majority leader's floor protocols for the 
118th Congress. Specifically, the majority leader's floor protocols on 
legislation call for sunset requirements to advance the policies 
``originally outlined in the Pledge to America to adopt a requirement 
that programs end or `sunset' by a date certain.'' That should include 
new sanction authorities, as well.
  It is important for Congress to maintain its Article I powers over 
foreign policy, and it does that by including a sunset provision. If we 
are going to be consistent with the floor protocols that the majority 
has established for new programs, if we want to reclaim our Article I 
powers, this act should not go into force without a sunset provision.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SELF. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Mr. SELF. Mr. Chair, this bill already contains behavior-based 
termination criteria for the sanctions described. Our sanctions on Iran 
should not disappear on an arbitrary date. Our sanctions need to remain 
in place until Iran stops threatening the United States, as already 
described in the bill.
  Iran has been a state sponsor of terrorism for over 40 years under, I 
might add, the same terrorist administration in Iran. If we put a 5-
year sunset on this bill, Iran and its terrorist proxies will think 
they can just wait us out.
  After October 7, it became clear that we need to take every possible 
measure available to deter Iran and its proxies. The best way to 
project American strength is to make it absolutely clear that our 
sanctions will remain in place until Iran no longer poses a threat to 
the United States.
  Therefore, I oppose this amendment to add an arbitrary sunset, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. Meeks), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Jackson 
amendment.
  The world in 2023 does not look like the world in 2018. Russia has 
invaded Ukraine. Hamas has attacked Israel. The Burmese partial 
democracy has collapsed in a coup.
  On the positive side of the ledger, NATO is more united than divided. 
The AUKUS pact has fortified our relationship with our closest allies. 
Japan and Korea are cooperating with each other like never before.
  In 2018, most of us were unfamiliar with the term ``coronavirus.'' In 
2023, many of us are trying to forget it. The point here is that the 
world can change dramatically in just 5 years.
  Congress does itself a disservice when we lock into policies without 
oversight or a chance to reconsider. Mr. Jackson's amendment would fix 
that flaw in the bill, and I strongly support his amendment.
  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. SELF. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. Clyde).
  Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Chair, I rise today to oppose Representative Jackson's 
amendment to add a 5-year sunset period. We cannot risk funds going to 
terrorism ever, certainly not now and certainly not in 5 years.
  Additionally, the only thing standing in the way of $14.3 billion 
going to support Israel's eradication of Hamas is Joe Biden and Chuck 
Schumer. The House has done its job. The Senate and the President have 
so far done nothing but be a roadblock. Yes, we are witnessing a Biden-
Schumer roadblock, a B-S roadblock, and it is totally unacceptable. It 
is a dangerous state of affairs, and Biden and Schumer are the problem.

[[Page H6015]]

  How can we support our closest ally in the Middle East when the 
President and the Senate stand in the way?
  The House has done its job. It is now time for the President and Mr. 
Schumer to clear their B-S roadblock.
  Mr. SELF. Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3 minutes remaining.
  Mr. SELF. Mr. Chair, deterrence is based on strength and the 
willingness to use it.
  In my time in the Middle East, I understood that our adversaries 
there, including Iran and its proxies, understand only strength. If we 
put an arbitrary sunset clause in this bill, it will be demonstrating 
weakness and not strength.
  Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment. I encourage my colleagues to vote 
against it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes 
appeared to have it.
  Mr. JACKSON of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois 
will be postponed.
  Mr. SELF. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.
  The motion was agreed to.
  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
Self) having assumed the chair, Mr. Clyde, Acting Chair of the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that 
that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5961) to 
freeze certain Iranian funds involved in the 2023 hostage deal between 
the United States and Iran, and for other purposes, had come to no 
resolution thereon.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud 
Lourdes University of Sylvania, Ohio, and its new president, William 
Bisset, who held a vital convening last week as part of the 
university's Courage Conversations Town Hall series. It focused on the 
Israel-Palestine conflict, with dozens of students, staff, and faculty 
taking part.
  University President Bisset and Professor Mary Robinson, who chairs 
the history, geography, and political science departments at Lourdes, 
said their goal was to offer a historical perspective to develop an 
understanding of the past history of Israel and Palestine to help 
people grasp the full scope of what is taking place in that war-torn 
region. They hope the conversations will help provide a better 
understanding of a longstanding conflict in which world leaders have 
long sought a true path toward a lasting peace and a two-state 
solution.
  Thoughtful discussions in which history is examined, as was done at 
Lourdes University last week, is the way a breakthrough for peace and 
reconciliation will come about. May other organizations follow the lead 
of Lourdes University.
  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a copy of an editorial from the 
Toledo Blade that recognizes this event and its important contribution 
to human understanding.

                    [From The Blade, Nov. 25, 2023]

                        Editorial: Lourdes Leads

                     (By The Blade Editorial Board)

       Kudos to Lourdes University for showing us the way forward 
     on the future of Palestine and Israel.
       Not afraid to tackle probably the most emotionally fraught 
     topic of our day, the university last week offered a ``town 
     hall'' on the topic of the Israeli-Hamas War.
       Would that others who have taken to the streets shouting 
     chants and waving signs and issuing orders to U.S. Rep. Marcy 
     Kaptur (D., Toledo) would show some of the same awareness of 
     how complicated this problem is.
       The university in Sylvania devoted its Courageous 
     Conversations Town Hall to the topic.
       Conscious of the ethnic and religious tensions, there was 
     security stationed at the door, but it wasn't needed.
       About 40, including administration staff, faculty members, 
     and students, attended.
       ``My goal was to offer this from a historical perspective 
     because I think the more people understand the past and the 
     history, the better understanding they will have of the 
     subject and be able to better understand both sides of the 
     story,'' said Mary Robinson, associate professor of history 
     and department chairman of history, geography, and political 
     science at Lourdes.
       President William Bisset said, ``We needed to start with a 
     conversation that explained that this has been a very, very 
     complicated part of the world for many, many years, that 
     leaders throughout the world have tried to figure out.
       ``We felt that it was important, especially for our 
     students, but also for our community members to start the 
     conversation [about Israel and Palestine] with a historical 
     perspective,'' Mr. Bisset said.
       Israel and the Palestinian people, and the armed guerilla 
     groups, Hamas and Hezbollah, who nurture the bitterness of 
     the Palestinians over their displacement from the land that 
     officially became Israel in 1948, are at an impasse, with 
     both sides claiming ownership of the land between Jordan 
     River and the Mediterranean Sea.
       But yet, there have been instances under at least two U.S. 
     presidents, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, that the 
     Palestinian people came close to securing a Palestinian 
     state.
       Among the Arab states of the Middle East, there appears to 
     be a willingness to once again take up the possibility of a 
     so-called two-state solution.
       It's not going to happen, though, if Hamas remains in power 
     in the Gaza Strip. Whether by Israel's current invasion of 
     Gaza or through the diplomatic intervention of Arab leaders 
     in the neighboring Islamic countries, Hamas and Hezbollah 
     have to be neutralized.
       Calm discussion in which the history is examined, as was 
     done in Lourdes University's Courageous Conversations Town 
     Hall last week, is the way a breakthrough will come about."

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
Schneider).
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Debbie Wasserman 
Schultz, for organizing this hour. I thank the Speaker for his 
indulgence and attention as we have gone through a long list typical of 
conversations talking about the hostages. I thank my friend from 
Michigan, General Bergman, for the time.
  We should not have to be here tonight. We should not be forced to 
talk

[[Page H6043]]

about some of the 250 people brutally kidnapped and taken hostage on 
October 7.
  It should not be necessary to call for the immediate, unconditional 
release of these hostages. We should not be here because Hamas should 
not be holding hostages.
  I am grateful that more than 100 hostages have been released and 
returned to Israel, but 143 hostages remain in captivity, held by 
Hamas, by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and by others in Gaza.
  The families don't know the status of their loved ones. They don't 
know where their loved ones are. They don't know when they will be 
coming home.
  I will talk tonight about one hostage, Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Hersh's 
parents, Rachel and Jon, are from Chicago. I have been friends with his 
aunt, Abby, for more than 30 years. I know his grandmother Leah. 
Hersh's family is now my family.
  Hersh was born in northern California. His family moved to Virginia 
when Hersh was 4 and to Israel when he was 7. That was in 2008. Hersh 
grew up in Jerusalem, reached adulthood, and was known widely as a 
kind, gentle mensch.
  On Friday, October 6, of this year, Hersh was with his family in 
Jerusalem. It was the evening of the Sabbath, Shabbat, and the holiday 
of Simchat Torah.
  The family went to synagogue and then went to dinner at a friend's 
house with two other families. After dinner, Hersh grabbed his backpack 
and left to meet his friend Aner. They later learned that Hersh and his 
friend were going to a concert in the south, a music festival.
  That was on Saturday, October 7. I will read at length some of the 
words of Hersh's father, Jonathan Polin, published in Time magazine.
  He says, describing his circumstance on Sunday, having learned that 
Hersh was taken hostage on Saturday, at some time--I think it was 
Sunday morning--a picture started to circulate online that was from an 
outdoor bomb shelter. They are not uncommon in the south of Israel.
  Our son was in the picture, as was Aner. Through social media, we 
started to search for other families of people who were in the shelter 
and to try to piece together a story.
  What we have subsequently pieced together, based on conversations 
with the three witnesses who were in the shelter with him, is the 
following: Sometime around 7:30 Saturday morning, those in the bomb 
shelter came under heavy gunfire. Grenades were being tossed into the 
shelter.
  Hersh's friend Aner, who was by the entrance of the bomb shelter, is 
responsible for the lives of anybody who is still alive--he was picking 
up grenades and tossing them back out and taking control of the 
situation. But it was total chaos. At least 11 grenades were thrown 
into the shelter. Aner picked up eight and threw them back out. Three 
exploded inside.

                              {time}  1930

  People were critically wounded. What we next know from witnesses is 
that at roughly 9 a.m., gunmen came into the shelter calmly, not 
shooting, and they said anybody who can get on their feet and walk out, 
walk out of here. And our son was one of the small number to walk out.
  That was 55 days ago: Seven Shabbat dinners with an empty seat in the 
Hersh Goldberg family; seven weeks of uncertainty not knowing where 
Hersh is; seven weeks of not knowing how Hersh is doing; seven weeks of 
not knowing when Hersh is coming home.
  Tonight, we have heard about so many of these hostages, 143 of the 
250-plus hostages taken still are in captivity. The IRC must be able to 
see Hersh in every one of the other hostages.
  Hersh and all the other hostages must come home. Not someday, not 
soon, but now. We owe it to these hostages to bring them home. We owe 
it to our families, and we must make sure that Hamas can never take 
hostages, can never attack Israel ever again.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida 
(Ms. Wasserman Schultz).
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend 
from Michigan, General Bergman, for his indulgence and his generosity.
  Mr. Speaker, I close by reminding the American public the names and 
faces you saw tonight are only a fraction of those who remain held 
hostage in Gaza by cowardly terrorists, by Hamas.
  I hope every American understands that Israel is fighting to protect 
her citizens from this diabolic terrorist organization and to rescue 
her hostages.
  There is only one culprit to blame for this war, and that is Hamas. 
Their singular goal is to destroy Israel and kill Jews.
  Mr. Speaker, this Chamber has always and will always continue to 
stand strong with Israel and work to release these victims from 
terrorist tyranny and support, preventing an attack like this from 
being perpetrated against Israel by Hamas ever again.
  ``Am Yisrael Chai,'' ``The people of Israel live.''
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
Landsman) as he provides his statement.
  Mr. LANDSMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and to 
my colleague, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, for bringing us all together 
today.
  I would just say a word or two about Doris Liber, who I met a few 
weeks ago. She came to the Capitol with other families who have loved 
ones who were taken hostage. Her son, Guy, was taken hostage by Hamas 
on October 7; 26 years old.
  He was at a festival with his friends, and terror took over. He was 
shot in the arm and called his mother. That was the last time she heard 
his voice. We hope and pray that he is alive and that he will be 
released.
  Every single one of these hostages must be released. Hamas must 
release every single hostage, and they must surrender.
  They can end this nightmare, and they can end this war.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have 
remaining?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 22 minutes 
remaining.


                             General Leave

  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit 
extraneous materials for the Record.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Michigan?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, the State of Qatar poses the gravest and 
most profound threat to the national security interest of the United 
States in the Middle East.
  This was true before October 7, but it is now undeniable in the 
aftermath of the unspeakable horrors of that day, where at least 32 
Americans were brutally murdered, and another 12 Americans were taken 
hostage.
  Qatar poses a threat to the U.S. not through its military. Nor does 
Qatar threaten the U.S. by training and directly equipping terrorist 
groups the same way that the Ayatollah and the mullahs from Iran do.
  Qatar threatens the U.S. even though it does not call Israel the 
Little Satan, nor does it call the United States the Great Satan. It is 
true that Qatar does not loudly proclaim that it wants to wipe Israel 
off the map, just as it does not publicly chant ``death to America.'' 
But it is precisely because Qatar does not espouse extremism so boldly 
and brazenly that this tiny but wealthy emirate is so dangerous to our 
national security interests.
  The nature of this threat is best understood by comparing and 
contrasting the two main state sponsors of Hamas--Qatar and Iran.
  Qatar has access to the corridors of power and the ability to mingle 
with world elites. Iran, on the other hand, simply does not have the 
ability to influence our glad-hand Western leaders.
  Iran does not get involved and invited to the G20. Qatar does.
  Iran does not attend Davos. Qatar does.
  Iran does not host the forward headquarters of CENTCOM, Central 
Command. Qatar does.
  The Iranian Ayatollah can't simply get President Biden on the phone 
for a friendly call, but the Qatari Emir can, and does.
  The Islamic Republic of Iran in its current form run by the mullahs 
would

[[Page H6044]]

never be designated as a major non-NATO ally. Yet just last year, 
President Biden bestowed this prestigious designation on the State of 
Qatar.
  Qatar has used its enormous influence with the West to help terrorist 
groups, such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Taliban. Qatar's singularly 
unique support for Hamas has proved invaluable for the bloodthirsty 
terrorist group.
  Hamas leaders not only planned the unprecedented error campaign from 
luxury villas and penthouse suites in Doha, provided to them by the 
State of Qatar, but they have been allowed to promote blood libels 
daily since October 7 on Al Jazeera, the propaganda outlet owned and 
ultimately controlled by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al 
Thani.

  For years and continuing to this day, Qatar has promoted and 
whitewashed Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Taliban, among other terrorist 
groups, including with fawning coverage on Al Jazeera. Qatar also 
effectively serves as the diplomatic arm for these terrorist groups, 
including when they claim to act as mediators with the terrorists from 
the West. And, of course, Qatar also funds these and other terrorist 
groups, sometimes overtly and sometimes quietly.
  But Qatar has also provided direct and material support to Hamas here 
in the United States, such as aggressively protecting the terrorist 
group by successfully killing legislation that was to enact harsh 
sanctions on the state sponsors of Hamas.
  As I will soon explain in more detail, the State of Qatar was single-
handedly responsible for killing the Hamas Sanctions Bill, which was 
first introduced in 2017 by my friend and colleague, Congressman Brian 
Mast.
  The State of Qatar not only killed the Hamas Sanctions Bill in the 
115th Congress, but after it was reintroduced in 2019, the emirate once 
again killed the legislation in the 116th Congress.
  While it is impossible to know for sure, it is distinctly possible 
that if Qatar had not gone to such extraordinary lengths to protect 
Hamas from sanctions, that the atrocities of October 7 might never have 
happened.
  Almost the entire Beltway foreign policy establishment, not just 
Democrats but also Republicans, have gotten Qatar wrong for the past 
25-plus years. The establishment's conventional wisdom is that although 
almost all outward indicators show that Qatar is firmly aligned with 
Iran, Islamists, and jihadists, the supposed truth is that they are 
secretly moderate and pro-America.
  Unfortunately, our foreign policy elites have chosen to cling to the 
illusion of who the Qataris privately claim to be, while ignoring the 
harsh reality of who they actually are.
  It is simply not true that Qataris are reluctantly close with Iran, 
Islamists, and jihadists, engaging with these malign actors out of 
necessity or to help the United States and the West.
  The overwhelming evidence shows that, in fact, the Qataris are true 
believers.
  Qatar's apologists claim that the emirate only has dealings with Iran 
because they jointly own the North Field, the world's largest natural 
gas reserve.
  Yet time and again, Qatar acts in sync with Iran across the Middle 
East, where both regimes just so happen to try and destabilize the same 
governments, especially those that are strong allies of the United 
States. And Qatar and Iran both sponsor some of the same terrorist 
groups, including Hamas and Hezbollah.
  There is no support for Ambassador Al Thani's allegation. The most 
generous interpretation for the emirate is that Qatar wanted to serve 
as the home for Hamas headquarters and its leaders, and that it 
convinced the Obama administration to allow them to become joined at 
the hip with this bloodthirsty terrorist group.
  Similarly, Qatar is also no reluctant supporter of Hamas. Qatar's 
Ambassador to America, Meshal Al Thani, implied in a Wall Street 
Journal op-ed earlier this month that the United States essentially 
requested Doha to host Hamas' world headquarters and to provide 
sanctuary to the terrorist group's leaders.
  The best evidence that Qatar genuinely supports Hamas and generally 
shares the same world view and goals as the terrorist organization is 
what you see when Hamas leaders, such as Ismail Haniyeh or Khaled 
Mashaal, meet with the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.
  As you can see in photos of their meetings, the Emir warmly embraces 
Mashaal, terrorists with blood on their hands, and the Emir clearly 
demonstrates with his smile and body language that he considers these 
Hamas thugs to be his close, personal friends.
  There are two other powerful indicators that Qatar agrees with the 
radicals who hate America.
  The first is the ruling Al Thani family's close relationship with the 
longtime spiritual leader of the International Muslim brotherhood, 
Yusuf Al-Qaradawi. The other is something available for anyone to see 
for themselves, the stomach-turning content of Al Jazeera, the Qatari 
state-owned propaganda outlet.
  Until Yusuf Al-Qaradawi died last year at the age of 96, he was not 
only the top religious cleric for the Muslim Brotherhood, but also for 
the ruling Al Thani family.
  The Qatar Foundation, which is actually a private company owned by 
the Emir of Qatar and his parents, worked closely with Qaradawi for 
decades, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to export and promote 
Qaradawi's deranged brand of Islam.

  To understand just how much of an extremist Qaradawi was, all you 
would have to do is watch the old broadcasts of his show on Al Jazeera. 
Over the years, Qaradawi used his platform to endorse violent jihad 
against the West, and he specifically advocated for terrorist attacks 
on Israel, as well as attacks on U.S. soldiers in Iraq.
  Qaradawi also praised the Holocaust and repeatedly used his show to 
promote the mass murder of Jews.
  On his Al Jazeera show in 2011, Qaradawi proclaimed that Allah used 
Adolf Hitler to wreak the Holocaust upon the Jews as divine punishment, 
and he praised Hitler for putting Jews in their place.
  Qaradawi was also well known for praising Hamas during the Al Jazeera 
broadcasts. Unfortunately, the entirety of Al Jazeera is now well known 
for praising Hamas.
  Al Jazeera has served as an unabashed cheerleader for Hamas for 
years, and especially since October 7. The broadcasts of state-owned Al 
Jazeera have been rife with explicit cheerleading for Hamas and 
spreading blood libels about the Jewish State.
  Not only does Al Jazeera reveal its repugnant biases in hailing Hamas 
as the resistance and casting Israel as the occupiers, but among its 
earliest reporting on Hamas' October 7 terrorist attack was a story 
praising the brutal kidnapping as ``humanitarian,'' under the headline, 
``Activists praise the resistance's humanitarian treatment of an 
Israeli woman and her children.''
  In the time since, Qatar's propaganda outlet has continued to 
interview top Hamas leaders, often in-studio in Doha, allowing them to 
promote dangerous falsehoods designed to incite viewers against not 
just Israel, but also America and the West.
  For years, Hamas has tried to sell the West a fiction, the idea that 
there is an armed wing and a political wing of the terrorist 
organization. Well, it is safe to say that since October 7, Al Jazeera 
has become the media wing of Hamas.
  If someone wants to know about Qatar's true foreign policy positions, 
all they need to do is check out Al Jazeera's Arabic language coverage.

                              {time}  1945

  That way, it wouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Qatar's Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on October 7 that holds Israel 
solely responsible for the mass murder of 1,200 innocents and the 
kidnapping of another 200-plus.
  Earlier this month, at a Gulf Cooperation Council gathering, Qatar's 
Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani doubled down on this position when 
he had the audacity to condemn the world for allowing Israel supposedly 
to be above the law, as if a nation should not be allowed to defend 
itself from mass murders at its border, even as the Emir himself very 
much treats the Hamas leaders as above the law by refusing to arrest 
them.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles).
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Speaker, if Americans knew that the Biden 
administration was treating a state sponsor of

[[Page H6045]]

terrorism like a major ally, they would be infuriated, but that is 
exactly what is going on with Qatar, a tiny but very wealthy country in 
the Persian Gulf.
  Qatar is a friend to anti-Semites. As the general stated, clearly, 
they must hate Israel and the Jewish people. They are one of the 
largest sponsors of state terrorism in the world. They regularly play 
host to leaders of Hamas and the Taliban. In fact, Qatar provided Hamas 
leadership with a venue to celebrate the horrific atrocities of October 
7.
  Only in a world where Joe Biden is President would we be supporting a 
terrorist country as part of our foreign policy. Last year, President 
Biden designated Qatar as a Major Non-NATO Ally, a special designation 
given to about 20 countries, like Taiwan and Israel, and an honor meant 
to highlight an extremely close bilateral relationship. In a sense, we 
do have a close relationship with Qatar, far too close.
  Qatar has given over $5 billion--that is b as in bravo--to U.S. 
colleges, which makes them the number one foreign donor to our very own 
educational institutions. Researchers at the Institute for the Study of 
Global Antisemitism and Policy have presented a strong link between the 
funding of U.S. universities by Doha and the active presence of anti-
Semitic groups on those campuses.
  Needless to say, we should be extremely wary about the impact of 
these donations on our young people. For decades, Congress has allowed 
these donations to flow into our universities without any supervision 
or meaningful disclosure requirements.
  Meanwhile, American Jews are harassed on campuses or compelled not to 
reveal their Jewish heritage. Since the start of the October 7 war, 73 
percent of Jewish students in the U.S. have been victims or witnesses 
to on-campus anti-Semitism.
  Qatar has the honor of hosting a major airbase outside of Doha. The 
presence of that airbase all but ensures their safety and that they 
will never be attacked. You would hope, at the very least, Qatar would 
try hard to ensure that it is not spreading anti-Semitism or supporting 
anti-American sentiments, but we have seen this anti-Semitism. We have 
seen it alive and well on Qatar's state-owned media outlet, Al Jazeera, 
or, as I like to say, AJTN, Al Jazeera terrorist network.
  Unfortunately, criticisms of Qatar come in muted in this town. Doha 
has certainly poisoned the well, purchasing the loyalties of university 
elites, influential think tanks, some of the best lobbyists that money 
can buy, and even politicians, which is why so many D.C. institutions 
whitewash Qatar's support for terrorism.
  On top of this, as I mentioned earlier, Qatar lets the leaders of 
Hamas and the Taliban stay at the most expensive hotels in Doha and 
provides up to $480 million, half a billion dollars, to Hamas to keep 
their military afloat.
  Qatar will tell you that this is going to nonmilitary uses, but we 
have heard throughout testimony today that money flowing to Qatar, 
flowing to Iran, is fungible.
  As the former chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. 
Ros-Lehtinen, once put it, in Qatar, there are three buckets: terror 
financed by the government, terror financed through Qataris, and terror 
financing that Qatar doesn't stop.
  That is the former chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee 
commenting on something that has been known for decades, known in this 
town, that Qatar openly and actively supports terrorism.
  Let's look at a few more examples. In 2003, Congress was informed of 
Qatar's funding to charities that support al-Qaida, including the bin 
Laden-endorsed charity, the Qatar Charity. The same year, The New York 
Times also reported that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11 
and one of the terrorists responsible for murdering 3,000 Americans, 
fled to Qatar from Kuwait in order to avoid apprehension.
  We also know that Qatar has provided support for al-Qaida's affiliate 
in Syria, al-Nusrah Front. Qatar has provided support to numerous 
terrorist groups, including the Taliban, the Muslim Brotherhood, and, 
of course, its most visible beneficiary, Hamas.
  What would you call a group that supports terrorists or a country 
that supports terrorist groups like al-Qaida, al-Nusrah, the Taliban, 
the Muslim Brotherhood, and Hamas? You would call them a state sponsor 
of terrorism.
  That is what this administration needs to do. It needs to remove 
Qatar's Major Non-NATO Ally status until such time that Qatar denounces 
terrorism and any support for terrorism or terrorist groups. If they 
don't, maybe it is time to label them as a state sponsor of terrorism.
  Earlier today, this House passed, in a unanimous fashion, my 
amendment to call on Qataris to condemn Hamas, turn over Hamas 
leadership to the U.S. or Israeli custody, and prevent Iran from 
receiving any funds.
  If the Emir of Qatar were here on the House floor, I would tell him 
to pick a side. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. 
Enough equivocating.
  Let me be clear. I do not wish ill on Qatar. In fact, I am open to 
dialogue.
  To the people of Qatar, I wish them well, but I want to ensure that 
my country has partners it can trust. Qatar has demonstrated time and 
again its unwillingness to abandon its two-faced approach toward 
relations with the United States and with terrorists.
  Mr. Speaker, regarding the atrocities, what does Qatar have to say 
when a mom and her 10- to 12-year-old daughter were brutally raped, 
left naked, and murdered in their home?
  What does Qatar have to say when a baby was put into an oven, the 
father murdered, and the wife brutally raped? What does Qatar have to 
say?
  When women were being gang-raped, their breasts cut off, and the 
terrorists were playing with them, tossing them around like toys, what 
does Qatar have to say?
  When they were sexually abusing men and cutting off their genitals, 
what does Qatar have to say?
  When the pregnant mom, her mouth gagged, was being held while they 
cut the baby out of her womb, what does Qatar have to say?
  They blame Israel.
  They need to pick a side. For too long, they have been on the wrong 
side.
  Let me make one final note on Qatar, and it is in reference to a 
comment made earlier by my colleague from Texas. He mentioned Qatar's 
role in helping to release hostages from the clutches of the Hamas 
dogs, the terrorists of Hamas. Most Americans taken by Hamas on October 
7 are still in custody. What has Qatar done?
  Many people, Israeli and otherwise, are still in Hamas custody. What 
has Qatar done?
  I would say they are stalling for time to allow Hamas to regroup, to 
flee, and to rebuild. It is time that families and children be 
reunited. We want every hostage released now.
  We pose a question to you: Do you think Qatar is the best 
intermediary for releasing hostages? I don't think they are.
  I am grateful for every hostage that has been released, but while 
Qatar is helping to release some hostages, they are also ensuring 
Hamas' preservation.
  I said earlier today that someone who robs your home and then offers 
to cut your grass 2 days later is still a thief. It does not change who 
they are.
  Given the level of financing Qatar provides Hamas on an annual basis, 
they could have at least compelled the release of all Americans.
  Let me mention briefly, Mr. Speaker, my Trust But Verify Act, which 
would delist Qatar's MNNA status, Major Non-NATO Ally status, until the 
President certifies that they are no longer providing support for 
international terrorism, and the President must recertify this every 90 
days.
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, time is finite because once a minute is 
gone, it is lost forever.
  I have countless examples here of how Qatar's influence is so deep in 
Washington, D.C. That includes hacking. That includes targeting 
committee chairmen. Most importantly, the biggest example that is read, 
The Gray Lady, The New York Times, is a business partner, to an extent, 
with Hamas.
  It is time that we stop treating Hamas' benefactors and the 
government as an ally. The time is now for the U.S. to force Qatar to 
choose between the U.S. and Hamas. They cannot embrace both. If they 
choose to continue embracing Hamas, we must treat them as we treat any 
other state sponsor of terrorist groups that murder Americans.

[[Page H6046]]

  Mr. Speaker, the State of Qatar poses the gravest and most profound 
threat to the national security interests of the United States in the 
Middle East.
  This was true before October 7th, but it is now undeniable in the 
aftermath of the unspeakable horrors of that day--where at least 32 
Americans were brutally murdered and another 12 Americans were taken 
hostage.
  Qatar poses a threat to the U.S. not through its military. Nor does 
Qatar threaten the U.S. by training and directly equipping terrorist 
groups the same way that the Ayatollah and the Mullahs from Iran do.
  Qatar threatens the U.S., even though it does nor call Israel the 
Little Satan, nor does it call the United States the Great Satan. And 
it is true that Qatar does not loudly proclaim that it wants to wipe 
Israel ``off the map,'' just as it does not publicly chant, ``Death to

ability to influence or glad-hand Western leaders.
  Iran does not get invited to the G-20--Qatar does.
  Iran does not attend Davos--Qatar does. Iran does not host the 
forward headquarters of CENTCOM--Qatar does.
  The Iranian Ayatollah can't simply get President Biden on the phone 
for a friendly call.
  But the Qatari Emir can--and does.
  The Islamic Republic of Iran in its current form run by the mullahs 
would never be designated as a ``Major Non-NATO Ally.'' Yet just last 
year, President Biden bestowed this prestigious designation on the 
State of Qatar.
  Qatar has used its enormous influence with the West to help terrorist

  The best evidence that Qatar genuinely supports Hamas and shares the 
same worldview and goals as the terrorist organization is what you see 
when Hamas leaders, such as Ismail Haniyeh or Khaled Mashaal, meet with 
the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamnad Al Thani.
  As you can see in photos of their meetings, the Emir warmly embraces 
Haniyeh and Mashaal--terrorists with blood on their hands--and the Emir 
clearly demonstrates with his smile and body language that he considers 
these Hamas thugs to be his close, personal friends.
  There are two other powerful indicators that Qatar agrees with the 
radicals who hate America.
  The first is the ruling Al Thani family's close relationship with the 
longtime ``spiritual leader'' of the International Muslim Brotherhood, 
Yusuf Al-Qaradawi.
  The other is something available for anyone to see for themselves--
the stomach-turning content of Al Jazeera, the Qatari state-owned 
propaganda outlet.
  Until Yusuf Al-Qaradawi died last year at age 96, he was not only the 
top religious cleric for the Muslim Brotherhood, but also for the 
ruling Al Thani family.
  The Qatar Foundation, which is actually a private company owned by 
the Emir of Qatar and his parents, worked closely with Qaradawi for 
decades, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to export and promote 
Qaradawi's deranged brand of Islam.
  To understand just how much of an extremist that Qaradawi was, all 
you would have to do is watch the old broadcasts of his show on Al 
Jazeera. Over the years, Qaradawi used his Al Jazeera platform to 
endorse violent jihad against the West, and he specifically advocated 
for terrorist attacks on Israel, as well as attacks on U.S. soldiers in 
Iraq.
  Qaradawi also praised the Holocaust, and repeatedly used his show to 
promote the mass murder of Jews.
  On his Al Jazeera show in 2011, Qaradawi proclaimed that ``Allah'' 
used Adolf Hitler to wreak the Holocaust upon the Jews as ``divine 
punishment,'' and he praised Hitler for ``putting (Jews) in their 
place.''
  Qaradawi was well-known for praising Hamas during his Al Jazeera 
broadcasts. Unfortunately, the entirety of Al Jazeera is now also well-
known for praising Hamas.
  Al Jazeera has served as an unabashed cheerleader for Hamas for 
years, and especially since October 7th. The broadcasts of state-owned 
Al Jazeera have been rife with explicit cheerleading for Hamas and 
spreading blood libels about the Jewish state.
  Not only does Al Jazeera reveal its repugnant biases in hailing Hamas 
as the ``resistance'' and casting Israel as the ``occupiers,'' but 
among its earliest reporting on Hamas' October 7th terrorist attack was 
a story praising the brutal kidnappings as ``humanitarian,'' under the 
headline, ``Activists praise the resistance's humanitarian treatment of 
an Israeli woman and her children.''
  In the time since, Qatar's propaganda outlet has continued to 
interview top Hamas leaders, often in-studio in Doha--allowing them to 
promote dangerous falsehoods designed to incite viewers against not 
just Israel, but also America and the West.
  For years, Hamas has tried to sell to the West a fiction, the idea 
that there is an ``armed wing'' and a ``political wing'' of the 
terrorist organization. Well, it is safe to say that since October 7th, 
Al Jazeera has become the media wing of Hamas.
  If someone wants to know about Qatar's true foreign policy positions, 
all they need to do is check out Al Jazeera's Arabic language coverage.
  That way, it wouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Qatar's Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on October 7th that it holds 
``Israel solely responsible'' for the mass murder of 1,200 innocents 
and the kidnapping of another 200-plus.
  Earlier this month at a Gulf Cooperation Council gathering, Qatar's 
Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani doubled down on this position, 
when he had the audacity to condemn

[[Page H6047]]

the world for allowing Israel supposedly to be ``above the law''--as if 
a nation should not be allowed to defend itself from mass murderers at 
its border--even as the Emir himself very much treats the Hamas leaders 
as ``above the law'' by refusing to arrest them.
  Qatar has been able to hoodwink the State Department and the foreign 
policy ``elites'' for years through a two-tiered, carrot-and-stick 
approach.
  They lavish money in all directions to purchase ``friends'' and 
supporters. And when they encounter the principled few who can't be 
bought off, Qatar has used its considerable espionage capabilities to 
target those critics it views as harmful to their interests.
  In short, Qatar's influence strategy can be summed up in three 
words--buy or destroy.
  The ``visible'' portion of Qatar's strategy has been to spread 
billions and billions of dollars across the U.S. Here's a srnall 
sampling of Qatar's largesse inside the U.S.:
  A total of $6 billion given to our universities, which doesn't 
include the millions it gives to radical, anti-American campus groups, 
such as Students for Justice in Palestine.
  An unknown dollar amount, but probably hundreds of millions of 
dollars in total, to think tanks.
  Millions and millions of dollars to The New York Times--yes, the 
``Gray Lady''--in the form of co-hosting dubious ``Art for Tomorrow'' 
conferences in Doha, as well as sponsoring other New York Times 
junkets, such as its ``Oil and Money'' conferences.
  Since 2017, Qatar has engaged at least 75 lobbying and PR firms, 
according to the FARA website, and it has paid these firms 
approximately $225 million, for an average of $3 million paid to each 
registered FARA agent.
  And most recently, Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar 
Investment Authority, or QIA, ``invested'' $200 million dollars to 
purchase 5 percent of Monumental Sports Entertainment, founded and run 
by Ted Leonsis, and which is the parent company of the NBA and NHL 
franchises right here in Washington, D.C., the Wizards and the 
Capitals.

  Qatar's lavish spending habits on lobbyists and now for sportswashing 
have garnered at least some media attention. But the dirty secret is 
that it is the darker side of Qatar's ``buy-or-destroy'' approach that 
has probably been even more effective.
  Qatar has engaged in hacking operations to intercept the 
communications of Americans whom the wealthy emirate believes to be 
harmful to its interests, reportedly by hiring firms such as Global 
Risk Advisors, founded and owned by former CIA agent Kevin Chalker, to 
plan and orchestrate these so called ``hack-and leak'' operations.
  In recent years, Qatari espionage activities have used hacked 
materials to smear a long list of powerful and influential figures, 
including both former and current U.S. government offIcials.
  Here are a few examples of the American critics of Qatar that the 
emirate went after through targeted dissemination of hacked materials 
to friendly media outlets:
  the former Homeland Security Advisor to the President, Fran Townsend;
  a former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Mark Wallace;
  the former Deputy National Security Advisor, Elliott Abrams;
  the former acting head of the Central Intelligence Agency, Michael 
Morell: and
  the then-sitting Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed 
Royce.
  The decision to target Chairman Royce is as stunning as it was 
brazen. But here is the cold, hard reality: a foreign government that 
sponsors numerous terrorist organizations used American citizens and 
others to intimidate and neutralize one of the most powerful U.S. 
government officials in matters of foreign policy, who at that time was 
the Chairman of this body's Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Although Qatar has never publicly stated why they unleashed their 
espionage forces on Chairman Royce, the reason seems obvious.
  It was to protect Hamas.
  In late 2017, Chairman Royce's committee unanimously passed the Hamas 
Sanctions Bill, whose findings mentioned two state sponsors of Hamas--
Iran and Qatar. It was no secret at that time that Qatar's top priority 
was killing the legislation, and Qatari lobbyists were swarming Capitol 
Hill, desperately attempting to halt the bill.
  Just a few months later, in early 2018, Qatar's high-priced PR agents 
worked in cahoots with media outlets, including The New York Times, to 
smear Chairman Royce--a good man, known and loved by many in this 
body--with splashy ``news'' stories that created false narratives 
through the use of hacked materials.
  What makes the whole operation to smear Chairman Royce even more 
outrageous is the very significant ethical conflict of the primary 
media outlet that relied on hacked materials to do Qatar's bidding--The 
New York Times.
  What the ``Gray Lady'' did not mention in any of the many stories it 
published based on emails hacked by Qatar is that The New York Times 
was in business with Qatar.
  In fact, Qatar and Brookfield had reached an agreement to purchase 42 
percent of the New York Times Building in Times Square by January 2018.
  The New York Times also neglected to mention in these stories placed 
by Qatar's Intelligence services that Qatar had been lining the pockets 
of The New York Times for at least several years by this time, with 
untold millions of dollars for ``sponsoring'' junkets hosted by The New 
York Times.
  So when the tiny but wealthy emirate needed to ``teach a lesson'' to 
any other Congressman or Senator thinking of criticizing Qatar--or even 
Hamas--the State of Qatar turned for help to its own business partner, 
The New York Times, which dutifully published a hit piece smearing the 
then-current Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
  The hit pieces that Qatar generated had the desired effect.
  Even though the Hamas Sanctions Bill, H.R. 2712, had been unanimously 
passed by the Foreign Affairs Committee in November 2017 and was 
expected to easily pass a Floor vote in this body.
  But after the Qataris successfully weaponized hacked materials to 
smear Chairman Royce, the Hamas Sanctions bill died a quiet death, 
never even making it to a Floor vote.
  Could anyone imagine the Chairman Royce scenario playing out the same 
way, but with different countries or a different target?
  For example, if Russia had targeted a Democratic Congressman or 
Senator that same way, does anyone doubt that the media and foreign 
policy ``elites'' would have been up in arms?
  Or if it had been Iran smearing a Democratic Congressman or Senator 
with hacked materials? This is yet another example of the unique threat 
posed by Qatar.
  There's no other nation that would be so daring as to intercept the 
communications of prominent Americans--let alone high-ranking U.S. 
government officials--that also has a cozy relationship with top media 
outlets or that has financial ties to a wide array of prominent and 
influential Americans.
  Who in academia would dare step up to criticize Qatar for openly 
targeting American critics, including U.S. government officials?
  Not likely someone affiliated with Harvard, which has received at 
least $17 million from Qatar.
  Probably not anyone affiliated with Northwestern University, which 
has raked in over $600 million from Qatar.
  The same goes for anyone affiliated with Georgetown University--which 
has received over $800 million in Qatari cash--or Cornell University, 
which Qatar has paid a staggering $2 billion.
  The top ranks of the think tank world are also surprisingly reluctant 
to criticize Qatar--which is no surprise given the millions upon 
millions of dollars that Qatar spreads to think tanks.

  And in case you might think that major law firms would be outraged at 
a foreign government hacking the communications of its American critics 
and then weaponizing those hacked materials, that has certainly not 
happened with Qatar.
  Among the law firms retained by Qatar is Covington, a law firm that 
acts as personal counsel to President Biden.
  Three Covington partners serve as the trustees of Biden's Vice 
Presidential Archives.
  Covington partner Dana Remus was the first White House Counsel in 
this Administration, and before that, she was the general counsel for 
the Biden 2020 Presidential campaign.
  Another Covington partner, Robert Lenhard, served as the lead outside 
counsel for the Biden 2020 Presidential campaign.
  And Lenhard's wife, Viveca Novak, was an editor at McClatchy News 
when that outlet was publishing stories based on materials hacked by 
Qatar in 2017-2018.
  Even with its tentacles everywhere in American society, the State of 
Qatar is looking to extend its influence operations into one of the 
last areas in the U.S. that has been immune from foreign influence--
American professional sports.
  The Qatar Investment Authority has purchased 5 percent of Monumental 
Sports Entertainment, the parent company of the NBA and NHL franchises 
right here in Washington, D.C.--the Wizards and the Capitals.
  Over the past month, I have sent multiple letters about QIA's 
proposed investment to the NBA, the NHL, and Monumental Sports.
  All three of them responded to my initial letters with dismissive 
replies, and then the NBA and Monumental ignored my following-up 
letters sent two weeks ago, which included straightforward questions 
that would shed light on some of the basic details regarding this 
business deal that is obviously of significant importance to the 
American public.
  There should be no doubt that Qatar's sole motivation for its 
investment into the Washington Wizards and the Washington Capitals is 
to give it a uniquely powerful tool for further

[[Page H6048]]

cementing its death grip on our Nation's capital.
  Congress must investigate this business arrangement. And because 
Monumental's President, Ted Leonsis, is seeking $600 million in 
taxpayer money to pair with Qatar's $200 million ``investment'' in 
order to renovate the Verizon Center, Congress has a duty to 
investigate.
  As my time comes to a close, let me conclude by saying that it is of 
paramount importance that the United States immediately begin to 
reassess its relationship with the State of Qatar.
  The only path forward is to pressure Qatar. It is unconscionable that 
Hamas is holding as hostages nine Americans and almost 200 others, 
while Hamas leaders live freely--and luxuriously--in Doha, just miles 
from the United States Air Base at Al Udeid.
  We owe it to the memory of the 32 Americans murdered on October 7. 
And we owe it to the American people, whose government should not be 
treating Hamas' benefactors as an ``ally.''
  The time is now for the U.S. to force Qatar to choose between the 
U.S. and Hamas. They cannot embrace both. And if they choose to 
continue embracing Hamas, we must treat them as we treat any other 
state sponsor of terrorist groups that murder Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, Mr. Speaker, proud to be an 
American. Why shouldn't I? My foreparents suffered 240-plus years of 
slavery to make it great. I am proud to stand in the House of 
Representatives today as a liberated Democrat, unbought, unbossed, and 
unafraid.
  Today, as a liberated Democrat, I will address two issues. Both 
relate to votes that I have taken. The first issue that I will address 
deals with affirming the state of Palestine's right to exist. The 
second issue that I will address will deal with my having voted 
``present'' in the case of the expulsion of Mr. Santos.
  With reference to the state of Palestine's right to exist, I am proud 
to tell you that on Tuesday of this week, we took a vote. Mr. Speaker, 
that vote on Tuesday of this week related to the State of Israel's 
right to exist. I believe that Israel has a right to exist. I believe 
in and support Israel's right to exist. I support Israel. I have done 
so since I have been in this Congress. Since I have been here, we have 
voted on more than $50 billion in support to Israel. You will find that 
I have voted for all the help to Israel.
  I have spoken on the floor in support of Israel, and I think that my 
record is very clear on where I stand when it comes to the State of 
Israel and its right to exist. I voted for the resolution. It was 
reaffirming Israel's right to exist. I voted for it. I, in voting for 
it, realized that it did not have something that I thought we ought to 
have, and that is a statement indicating that Palestine has a right to 
exist.
  Palestine has been there, the inhabitants. In 1948, when the U.N. 
decided that it would, by way of resolution, recognize two states in 
the area, the area referred to was Palestine. I believe that Palestine, 
with Palestinians, has a right to exist, as well.
  Today, I will file the resolution that I shall read. This resolution 
is one that affirms the state of Palestine's right to exist.
  Now, I understand that Palestine is not a state currently, and I 
address that in the resolution. This is not calling for an immediate 
styling or having Palestine become a state. That is not what the 
resolution is about. It is recognizing the right to become a state.
  In this Congress, we have said that there should be a solution to the 
concerns related to Israel and Palestine, and it is a two-state 
solution that we have talked about.
  The President of the United States has said that there should be a 
two-state solution. I believe that there should be a two-state 
solution. If there is going to be a two-state solution, and if we are 
going to fund Palestine and Israel as we have--we have sent many 
dollars in humanitarian aid to Palestine--and if we are going to 
continue

[[Page H6069]]

to do this, and if I am going to continue to vote for these funds, I 
want Congress to be on record saying that there ought to be a State of 
Israel and that we can have a state for Palestinians, as well.
  I shall file the resolution, and I shall file it immediately after I 
finish this statement about Palestine as well as about my vote of 
``present'' on Mr. Santos for his expulsion.
  First, let's talk about Palestine. Here is a resolution. It reads:
  Affirming the state of Palestine's right to exist. In the House of 
Representatives, Mr. Green of Texas submitted the following resolution, 
which was referred to a proper committee.
  The resolution itself reads:
  Affirming the state of Palestine's right to exist.
  Whereas, this resolution may be cited as the original resolution 
affirming the state of Palestine's right to exist;
  Whereas, the people, the Palestinian people, are inhabitants of the 
land of Palestine;
  Whereas, in 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed 
Resolution 181, which called for the partition of Palestine into Arab 
and Jewish states.
  I may have said 1948 earlier. This corrects my earlier statement.
  Whereas, on May 14, 1948, President Harry Truman issued a statement 
recognizing Israel as an independent state; and
  Whereas, on November 28, 2023, the House of Representatives agreed to 
H. Res. 888 reaffirming the State of Israel's right to exist by a vote 
of 412 ``yeas,'' 1 ``nay,'' and 1 ``present.''
  I voted for the resolution. I believe Israel has a right to exist. I 
believe that the House of Representatives should be on record 
indicating that Israel has a right to exist.
  Continuing: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of 
Representatives affirms Palestine's right to exist and at a future 
time--important words, ``and at a future time''--to become a nation-
state.
  Some things bear repeating: Resolved that the House of 
Representatives affirms Palestine's right to exist and at a future time 
to become a nation-state.
  If we believe in a two-state solution, then we want to have this 
resolution approved by the House of Representatives. We believe that 
Israel has a right to exist as a nation-state. We say we want a two-
state solution. This but only codifies what we say.
  The President of the United States has said there should be a two-
state solution. You can't have a two-state solution without at some 
point recognizing the fact that Palestine has to be one of the two 
states.
  Again: Resolved that the House of Representatives affirms Palestine's 
right to exist and at a future time to become a nation-state.
  That was number one.
  Number two: Recognizes the two-state solution as the only solution 
that will secure a lasting peace in the region.
  Number three: Rejects calls for Palestine's destruction.
  Just as we reject calls to have Israel destroyed, we should reject 
calls to have Palestine destroyed or the notion of a Palestinian state 
to become a nonexistent notion.
  I believe this resolution is going to make a difference. I am going 
to file this resolution. I believe that the resolution ought to go to 
the proper committee. I will ask the chairperson of the proper 
committee to bring the resolution to a vote within the committee or to 
process it out of the committee. I will leave it to the chair and the 
ranking member to make the decisions as to how this will work.
  I want it to come to the floor for a vote. I would like to see it 
have the opportunity to come to the floor for a vote with the same 
level of expediency that the resolution supporting Israel's right to 
exist had in coming to the floor to a vote. There was expediency 
exerted. There was expediency that allowed that resolution to get to 
the floor not within months, not within weeks, but within days. I ask 
that this resolution receive the same level of respect.
  We have to respect Israel's right to exist, and we have to respect 
Palestine's right to exist. Both have the right to exist. The 
resolution makes it possible for the Congress to go on record.
  I also believe this. Aside from filing the resolution, I believe that 
there are three things that have to happen for Palestine to become a 
state. The first thing that has to happen is there has to be a 
recognition that Palestine is a state, obviously, but by the House of 
Representatives, that it should become a state by the House of 
Representatives. Number one, Palestine has to become a state, and the 
House of Representatives has to recognize this right for Palestine to 
become a state.
  Number two, I think that the Israelis should recognize Palestine's 
right to become a state, but I don't think that we have to allow them 
to determine whether Palestine should become a state. I think that 
Palestinians have the right to have statehood without having the 
Israelis determine that they should become a state.
  Number three, just as in 1948 when President Truman recognized Israel 
as a state without the consent of the Palestinians, I believe that a 
President of the United States can recognize Palestine as a state 
without the consent of Israel. I don't think Israel has to give its 
consent for Palestine to become a state. Just as we recognized Israel 
without Palestinians giving their consent, we can do the same thing for 
Palestine without Israel giving its consent. I believe that Palestine 
has a right to become a state, and I don't believe that Israel has the 
right to veto the Palestinian's right to become a state.
  I will file this resolution, which will put the House on record. If 
the House goes on record, I will continue my efforts to push for a two-
state solution as a resolution to the concerns between the Palestinians 
and the Israelis.


            On the Matter of the Expulsion of George Santos

  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, now, to my second point, the issue 
related to Mr. Santos.
  I voted ``present'' today. Let's look at what the vote count was. The 
vote count was 311 ``yeas,'' 114 ``nays,'' 2 ``present,'' and 8 persons 
not voting.
  I am proud of my vote. I am proud to say that I voted ``present.''
  It is not unusual for me to stand alone. I know that it takes a 
certain type of courage to stand alone. I pray that I will continue to 
have that type of courage because I believe that the House has made a 
mistake today in going on record and expelling Mr. Santos from 
Congress.
  I believe it was a mistake because I believe that the process itself 
will now lend itself to whatever 290 persons believe to be a reason to 
expel a person, that becomes a reason for a person to be expelled. 
Whatever 290 persons can agree on, you can now expel a person. I don't 
think that that process is a fair and just process.
  Let me continue by saying this. Yes, the House had every right to do 
what it did. Yes, constitutionally, the House had the right to do what 
it did. Constitutionally, it did, yes.

                              {time}  1200

  Yes. So it is not about whether I differ with the Constitution or 
differ with whether the House had a right to do this. I believe that we 
have the right to do things, but I believe also that there are better 
ways to do things, and there are some ways that we should not do 
things.
  Prior to today, it has been said many times, that five persons have 
been expelled--two for having committed crimes and three for having 
been associated with the Confederacy and its rebellion against the 
Union, the United States.
  I think that what we have done today opens ourselves up to having 
persons expelled for things that a good many people are not going to 
agree with. Let me explain.
  To expel a person without a bifurcated system, in my opinion, is a 
mistake. Impeachment has a bifurcated system. The House indicts by way 
of impeaching, and then after impeaching, the Senate has the trial to 
convict or not. Impeachment itself is not bifurcated, the process to 
remove the President from office is bifurcated. Impeachment is one part 
of that process. That is the function of the House.
  The process then provides that if you want to continue and remove, 
you have to get the consent of the Senate. That is the bifurcated 
process to remove a President from office.
  I think we ought to have a bifurcated process--notwithstanding our 
right not to. I think we ought to have a bifurcated process to remove a 
person from Congress.

[[Page H6070]]

  There is only one way for a person to get to the Congress of the 
United States of America, unlike the Senate, where you can get 
appointed. With the Congress, you have to be voted in by the people. 
That is why this is the people's House. This House belongs to the 
people of the United States of America, and membership herein belongs 
to the people of the United States of America.
  In the infinite wisdom of those who were the codifiers and the 
writers of the Constitution, they have given us the authority to remove 
people. We can do it. I just happen to disagree with the way we are 
doing it. By doing it this way, without having the actual House of 
Representatives give some deference to the judicial system, we no 
longer have another party in the process.
  We, in fact, now have become the investigators, the judges, the jury, 
and the prosecutors. We have every right to do that. I don't quarrel 
with anyone who would say to me, as a retort, well, we have the right 
to do it. We have every right to do it.
  The question is: should we do this?
  I don't think so. I think it was a mistake. I think that at some 
point in the future we are going to see the error of our ways. This 
decision is going to haunt us. You cannot appeal a decision of the 
House of Representatives, which is why we ought to have the judicial 
system involved.
  If a person commits a crime, it is brought to our attention, there is 
a conviction, it comes from the judiciary, and we then act on that 
conviction. We have now a second party involved in the process such 
that that party can deliberate and make a decision without the House of 
Representatives having influenced that decision. I think that is a fair 
way to remove people from the House of Representatives.
  I don't think that we should do it with the House being the 
investigators, the judge, the jury, and the prosecutor. I believe that 
justice itself would be better served if we used the system that we 
have been using. Utilizing the system that we have put into place today 
I think is going to create some serious concerns for us in the future.
  What can we do?
  We can impose sanctions. We can remove persons from their committee 
assignments. We can publish our findings. We can allow the citizens--
which every 2 years they have the opportunity to determine who will 
serve them--allow them to have the vote and let them determine whether 
or not they want a person--that I might deem unfit to serve--give them 
the opportunity to do so.
  I think that a bifurcated system works better than the system that we 
have now installed in the House of Representatives.
  I believe, given the history of my country that I love--again, I love 
it because my foreparents suffered for 240 years as enslaved persons. 
We built it. We made it great with the economic foundation of mothers 
and fathers. Yes, I love my country.
  I also understand that my country is not always fair to people of 
color. It hasn't been. To this day there are times when it still is 
not. I think people of color are going to regret having cast that vote 
because we are the most vulnerable--we are the most vulnerable in this 
country.
  Let me say this: we are among the most vulnerable because I recognize 
that there are other persons who are vulnerable, as well. We are among 
the most vulnerable in this country. Among the most vulnerable. There 
are others who are vulnerable, as well. I don't want to disrespect the 
truth.
  I know that we suffer because I understand how we got here and why we 
were brought here. We were brought here to be permanent--240 years of 
slavery is evidence of the desire to have permanency. We were brought 
here to be permanent subservient--with no power. Subservient. Having 
the mindset of a person who wants to serve and wants to please.
  A permanent subservient. Powerless. There was a desire that we never 
have the power that we have today. I am grateful for the way the 
country has metamorphosed to this point. I am sorry it took so long. I 
regret that there was ever an institution of slavery. A permanent, 
subservient, powerless cast of people.
  I would also add this: identifiable. Identifiable, permanent, 
subservient, powerless cast of people. Identifiable. There is your 
evidence. Identifiable. Subservient--240 years, plus, of slavery. A 
powerless, subservient cast.
  Born into slavery. Died as a slave. That 240 years has not been 
erased. No, we don't have slavery in the country today, but we still 
have some minds that have not metamorphosed into the future. We have 
some people who still disrespect people of African ancestry.

  They disrespect people of African ancestry as evidenced by certain 
things they do or choose not to do. Disrespect. Disrespect because they 
will respect people who rebelled against the country, who fought to 
maintain slavery, who were in the Confederacy, they respect them.
  In 1956, this Congress gave them a Congressional Gold Medal, the 
enslavers, the Confederate soldiers. To this day, the Congress doesn't 
have the respect that it should have for the enslaved. No Congressional 
Gold Medal for the enslaved. The Congressional Gold Medal is for the 
enslavers.


 The Russell Senate Office Building is Disrespectful to People of Color

  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, persons of color suffer greatly in 
this country. Disrespect. Disrespect because right across the street 
there is a building, the Russell Senate Office Building, that 
disrespects people of color.
  Richard Russell was a self-proclaimed white supremacist. He was a 
Senator who fought the Voting Rights Act and voting rights in general. 
He was a Senator who was a coauthor of the Southern Manifesto. He was a 
racist and a bigot.
  His name is on the building. We have been asking now for a long time 
that his name be removed from the building. We find that the Senate, in 
its wisdom, has not done so. That is disrespecting people of color. 
Yes, we are among the most disrespected in this country.
  There is evidence and the Senate could remove Russell's name from 
that building tomorrow if they wanted to. It is not a question of 
whether there is a way, it is a question of whether they have the will. 
I marvel at how Senators' offices are in a building named after a 
racist and a bigot. I don't go into the Russell Senate Office Building. 
I respect myself enough to stay out of the Russell Senate Office 
Building.
  Those Senators, they decide the timeline. Until they decide that it 
should be removed, it won't be removed. It will be removed. When it is 
removed, I am going to acknowledge it and be grateful for it. I will 
tell them that it took too long. It is just taking too long. Why?
  They claim they can't remove a racist's name from a building paid for 
by taxpayer dollars because they can't agree on a new name. We have 
solved that problem. Simply call it what it was before it became the 
Russell Senate Office Building, and that was the Old Senate Office 
Building.
  Let it become the Old Senate Office Building. Then take as much time 
as you like to conclude that it should have some worthy person's name. 
I have no name to offer. I only want that you do justice by Black 
people the same way you do justice by other people.
  The same way you make an issue of an injustice against others. Make 
the same about television time available to criticize the Richard 
Russell Office Building and the name being on it. It is a symbol of 
national shame.
  Why is it that CNN, MSNBC, FOX, all of them, why have they not made a 
big to-do of it?
  One of the reasons may be because they report the news from the 
Russell Senate Office Building. Yes, they are all located right there 
near the rotunda where Richard Russell has a statue in his honor.
  The Richard Russell Office Building is a symbol of national shame, 
and the news outlets ought to be ashamed of themselves to tolerate it 
and then participate in it--to participate in the perpetuation of the 
maintenance of the name on the building. They ought to be ashamed of 
themselves.
  Yes, people of color are among the most disrespected. Yes, we are.

                              {time}  1215

  That is why I am concerned about this vote that we have taken today. 
It is because we are among the most disrespected that I am not sure our 
transgressions are going to be judged the same as the transgression of 
a person of a different hue. I believe that a

[[Page H6071]]

person of a different hue can get a better decision than a person of 
color in this country.
  We see it all the time in the courts of the country. I was a judge of 
a small claims court for one-quarter of a century. I was a litigator. I 
saw the injustices as they took place that I could do nothing about. 
This is an injustice that is in its infancy.
  Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, I warn you that you are going to see the 
injustice take place. You will see it. Maybe what I am saying today 
will help to prevent it. I doubt it. I doubt it.
  There are some Members that I am very much concerned about now that 
this vote has been taken. I am very much concerned about them because 
there are people here who would want to remove them from office if they 
could without having committed a crime because of positions that they 
have taken, policy positions. That would be an injustice.
  So, I am proud of my vote. I voted the way I voted for reasons that I 
have called to your attention, Mr. Speaker, but a review does not hurt.
  One, Mr. Speaker, the only way you get here is if the people elect 
you. You can't be appointed to the House of Representatives. It is the 
people's House. The people send us, and the people ought to remove us 
unless we have committed a crime and been adjudicated as such by a 
proper court.
  Two, the decisions are not appealable. There is no appeal from our 
decision.
  Three, the process itself is not bifurcated any longer when it comes 
to removal from the House of Representatives. Prior to today, it was 
bifurcated, and the judicial system would have the opportunity to judge 
a person and determine whether the person was guilty of a crime. 
Finding such, that could then be used by the House of Representatives 
to expel the person.
  We have taken the judicial system completely out of the process. We 
have become judge, jury, prosecutors, and investigators.
  The truth is, whatever 290 of us can agree on, then that is a reason 
to expel a person. If 290 of us can agree on a reason, then that is it. 
Given the way we have entrenched ourselves now into teams, I don't 
favor the consequences that I can foresee.
  We have allowed ourselves now to become, unfortunately, a House of 
Representatives where this discord is no longer just a difference of 
opinion about policy. It has become a means by which we can come to the 
floor to remove a person from office, a person who was sent here by 
people who voted. I am much afraid for what we are going to have to 
regret because of what we will do as time progresses.
  So, I shall now move to the well of the House and file my resolution 
affirming the state of Palestine's right to exist. I have read it to 
you, Mr. Speaker. Some Members may be tuning in late, so I will read it 
again. This is the resolution.
  I voted for Israel's right to exist on Tuesday of this week. I think 
we ought to vote similarly for Palestine to have a right to exist, as 
well.
  It reads:
  Affirming the state of Palestine's right to exist.
  Whereas, this resolution may be cited as the Original Resolution 
Affirming the State of Palestine's Right to Exist;
  Whereas, Palestinian people are inhabitants of the land of Palestine;
  Whereas, in 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed 
Resolution 181, which called for the partition of Palestine into Arab 
and Jewish states;
  Whereas, on May 14, 1948, President Harry Truman issued a statement 
recognizing Israel as an independent state.
  Mr. Speaker, I support Israel as an independent state. That is not 
here. I support Israel as an independent state. This is a sidebar 
comment. I have supported it. I will continue to support it.
  I supported Israel by voting for more than $50 billion in funds, but 
I did it because I thought we were moving toward a two-state solution. 
I did it because I thought a two-state solution was the will and the 
desire of the House of Representatives.
  I have reached a point now where I have to know. That is what I 
thought. Passage of the resolution will give me the certainty I need. 
The absence of the passage of the resolution will cause me to have a 
great deal of consternation about how I am going to approach votes in 
the future.
  To continue:
  Whereas, on November 28, 2023, the House of Representatives agreed to 
H. Res. 888, reaffirming the State of Israel's right to exist--I voted 
for it, and I would vote for it again and again and again if given the 
opportunity--by a vote of 412 ``yeas,'' 1 ``nay,'' and 1 ``present.''
  Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the House of Representatives, 
one, affirms Palestine's right to exist and at a future time to become 
a state.
  Mr. Speaker, I accentuated at a future time because I am making it 
clear to those who would make the argument that this is about saying 
that Palestine should become a state today. That is not what I am 
saying. ``At a future time''--I don't know when in the future, but I do 
believe that we ought to have that as our goal since we have stated 
that we want a two-state solution.
  Number two, recognizes the two-state solution as the only solution 
that will secure a lasting peace in the region.
  Mr. Speaker, I believe this. There are some people who want a one-
state solution. They mouth ``two state,'' but in their hearts, they 
want one state. I am not one of them. What I say is what I mean.
  Those Members who say they want a two-state solution and really want 
a one-state solution, well, this is not for them. This is for people 
who want a two-state solution.

  Number three, rejects calls for Palestine's destruction.
  Mr. Speaker, there will be people who will say that nobody is calling 
for Palestine's destruction. They are wrong. I was on C-SPAN just this 
week, and there was a caller who called in and who literally, by virtue 
of the way he presented his argument, wanted to see the destruction of 
Palestine, the destruction of Palestine. I am not for that. I am not 
for that. I am not for what is happening with the destruction of 
Palestine currently. For us to conclude that it is okay to destroy 
Palestine is an absurdity.
  How could we possibly approve of the destruction that we see and the 
lives that are being taken? How could we approve of that? I don't 
approve of it. If others can approve of it, the killing of babies, I 
don't approve of it.
  Yes, you have a right to defend yourself, but you have to do it in a 
just fashion. To perform, if you will, an unjust act in the name of 
justice is still an injustice. You cannot clean it up by saying it is a 
just act. Your actions themselves speak for you.
  Killing babies is not a just act, especially when you have declared 
war on Hamas and you end up killing Palestinian babies. It was wrong to 
kill Israeli babies. What Hamas did was dastardly. The way they did it, 
it is impossible to even imagine a human being doing it, but you can't 
complain about killing innocent Israeli babies and then decide: Well, 
it is okay. The Palestinian babies are just collateral damage. They 
just happened to be in the wrong place.
  What is wrong with us? I will not support the killing of these 
Palestinian babies. I will not support the destruction of Gaza. I pray 
that this country will come to its senses.
  How long can this go on?
  Mr. Speaker, I am always honored to have this opportunity. I don't 
know how much longer I will have it. There are a lot of people who 
don't like what I say who have the power to change rules.
  As you have seen today, Mr. Speaker, they can change the rules. So, I 
never know when I will be giving my last speech from this podium, but 
as long as I have the opportunity to give a speech, I am going to speak 
truth to power, but more than that, I am going to speak truth about 
power.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 894) strongly condemning and denouncing the drastic 
rise of antisemitism in the United States and around the world.
  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.
  The text of the resolution is as follows:

                              H. Res. 894

       Whereas acts of hate, intimidation, discrimination, and 
     violence based on ethnicity or religion have no place in our 
     country nor in the global community;
       Whereas the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's 
     working definition of antisemitism is widely accepted and 
     serves as a critical tool to help individuals comprehend and 
     identify the various manifestations of antisemitism;
       Whereas, since the massacre of innocent Israelis by Hamas, 
     an Iran-backed terrorist organization, on October 7, 2023, 
     antisemitic incidents of harassment, vandalism, and assault 
     in the United States have spiked 388 percent over the same 
     period last year, according to reports from the Anti-
     Defamation League's (ADL) Center on Extremism;
       Whereas drastic increases in antisemitic activity has also 
     been seen in Jewish communities around the world since the 
     October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks;
       Whereas the slogan ``From the River to the Sea'', which is 
     a rallying cry for the eradication of the State of Israel and 
     the Jewish people, has been used by anti-Israel protesters in 
     the United States and globally;
       Whereas, on October 8, 2023, a car with individuals holding 
     Palestinian flags appeared to intentionally swerve out of its 
     lane, nearly hitting a visibly Jewish family in Clifton, New 
     Jersey;
       Whereas, on October 15, 2023, an individual in New York, 
     New York, punched a Jewish woman in the face at Grand Central 
     Terminal solely because she was Jewish;
       Whereas, on October 28, 2023, a Jewish man in Sydney, 
     Australia, was severely injured by 3 anti-Israel rioters, in 
     which he was punched in the head at least 12 times, suffered 
     a concussion, 2 black eyes, and 4 spinal fractures;
       Whereas, on November 3, 2023, a Jewish woman's store in New 
     York City was attacked by a mob of anti-Israel protesters all 
     because she hung posters of Israeli hostages in the store 
     window;
       Whereas, on November 3, 2023, 4 masked men walked into a 
     restaurant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and proceeded to 
     tear down an Israeli flag and yelled ``Free Palestine'';
       Whereas, on November 4, 2023, an Arizona man was arrested 
     by Federal authorities for threatening to execute a local 
     Rabbi and ``every other JEW I can find tonight at midnight of 
     your Sabbath'';
       Whereas, on November 4, 2023, during an anti-Israel protest 
     in Washington, DC, rioters shouted their support for Hamas 
     massacre on October 7, 2023, and other acts of terror 
     targeting Israel, called for the end of the State of Israel, 
     and spewed hateful and vile language amplifying antisemitic 
     themes;
       Whereas, during that same protest in Washington, DC, 
     rioters stormed and tried to scale the White House fence, 
     vandalized property by staining blood-red handprints onto the 
     side of the White House pillars, and spray painted ``Death to 
     Israel'' and ``Glory to our Martyrs'' on buildings in DC;
       Whereas, on November 6, 2023, Paul Kessler, a 69-year-old 
     Jewish man, tragically died due to injuries sustained when an 
     anti-Israel protester struck him in the head with a megaphone 
     in Los Angeles, California;
       Whereas, on November 11, 2023, as part of a massive anti-
     Israel protest, rioters set off smokebombs in front of a 
     synagogue in London, England;
       Whereas, on November 12, 2023, police found several 
     headstones at the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery, a Jewish 
     cemetery in Brooklyn, Ohio, were desecrated with swastikas;
       Whereas, on November 13, 2023, a mezuzah was torn off the 
     doorpost of a Jewish person's apartment and a knife was stuck 
     into the wood in its place in Milan, Italy;
       Whereas, on November 13, 2023, the evening before the March 
     for Israel in Washington, DC, anti-Israel rioters vandalized 
     a Jewish medical tent by spray painting ``Free Gaza'', 
     ``Palestine Will Be Free'', and ``Gaza Will Win''; and
       Whereas, on November 15, 2023, anti-Israel protesters 
     illegally blocked and violently attacked the Democratic 
     National Committee headquarters, endangering the lives of 
     individuals inside, including Members of Congress, and 
     injuring 6 Capitol Police Officers; Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
       (1) strongly condemns and denounces all instances of 
     antisemitism occurring in the United States and globally;
       (2) reaffirms and reiterates its strong support for the 
     Jewish community at home and abroad;
       (3) calls on elected officials and world leaders to condemn 
     and fight all forms of domestic and global antisemitism;
       (4) clearly and firmly states that anti-Zionism is 
     antisemitism; and
       (5) rejects all forms of terror, hate, discrimination, and 
     harassment of members of the Jewish community.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Kiley) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.


                             General Leave

  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
insert extraneous material on H. Res. 894.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from California?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, since the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas against 
Israel, anti-Semitism has surged in the United States and around the 
world.
  Reports show that there was a nearly 400 percent increase in anti-
Semitic incidents in the weeks after the attack. These incidents 
include harassment, vandalism, and assault. Americans have been 
punched, beaten, and forced to flee for their lives from swerving cars 
simply because they are Jewish.

                              {time}  1715

  A Jewish cemetery in Brooklyn, Ohio, was vandalized with swastikas.
  On college campuses, Jewish students have been subjected to 
harassment, threats, and forced to hide from violent protests.
  In a recent survey, 73 percent of Jewish college students said they 
had experienced or witnessed some form of anti-Semitism this academic 
year.
  In the same survey, just 39 percent of Jewish students said they felt 
comfortable with their peers knowing they were Jewish.
  Less than half of Jewish students surveyed said that they felt safe 
on campus.
  At a hearing before our committee last month, a college student 
testified that she now thinks twice before wearing any sign of her 
Jewish faith. This was a young woman who is maybe 20 years old. She had 
the courage to come and testify before Congress, but she can't safely 
wear something that would suggest to her fellow students and her 
teachers that she is Jewish.
  She testified that her family and friends who live in Israel--people 
who are under nearly constant rocket attack from Hamas--and others 
check in with her every day to see if she is safe. They are in a war 
zone. She is in the United States, and they are checking to make sure 
that she is safe.
  These incidents are absolutely horrifying, Mr. Speaker. They are 
unacceptable in the United States and in any civilized society. Members 
of the Jewish community should not have to hide their faith in order to 
safely go about their lives or receive an education.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this resolution, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.

                                         House of Representatives,


                                 Committee on Foreign Affairs,

     Hon. Jim Jordan,
     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Jordan: Thank you for consulting with the 
     Foreign Affairs Committee, which agrees to be discharged from 
     further consideration of H. Res. 894 (Strongly condemning and 
     denouncing the drastic rise of antisemitism in the United 
     States and around the world), so that the measure may proceed 
     expeditiously to the House floor.
       I ask that you place our letters on this resolution into 
     the Congressional Record during floor consideration. I 
     appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and 
     look forward to continuing to work together as this measure 
     moves through the legislative process.
           Sincerely,

     condemning and denouncing the drastic rise of antisemitism in 
     the United States and around the world, so that the measure 
     may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.
       I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure 
     does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of 
     your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives 
     on this measure or similar legislation in the future.
       I will include the exchange of these letters in the 
     Congressional Record during floor consideration of this 
     measure. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this 
     legislation and look forward to continuing to work together 
     on matters of shared jurisdiction during this Congress. Thank 
     you for your attention to this matter.

  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I rise today in strong support of any and all serious and meaningful 
efforts to combat anti-Semitism.
  The explosion of anti-Semitism around the world, on college campuses, 
and online is so shocking that it was the subject of nearly every 
Jewish household's Thanksgiving meal a week ago.
  The Jewish community is absolutely right to consider this terrifying 
situation a five-alarm fire, as Senator Schumer so appropriately put it 
in his moving speech to the Nation just a few days ago.
  Unfortunately, this resolution does absolutely nothing to genuinely 
counter the scourge of anti-Semitism, nor does it help bring us 
together with the unity of purpose that this topic merits. Rather, it 
is another attempt in a long series of veiled efforts by the GOP to 
weaponize Jewish lives for political gains. It is another partisan 
gotcha game that amounts to cheap value signaling, not serious action. 
If there ever was a time for real action, it is now.
  Today, in the face of the largest increase in anti-Semitism, both 
violent and virulent, in this Nation's history, we have a clear choice. 
We can abuse this moment to try to inflict interparty political damage 
or we can rise to the occasion and do something real and powerful to 
actually help the Jewish community.
  Just in the last few weeks, we have seen disgusting displays of 
outright anti-Semitism. Over the weekend, protesters in Philadelphia 
targeted a Jewish business. It is plainly and unequivocally anti-
Semitic to hold Jews collectively responsible for Israel's actions.
  In my district, vile, anti-Semitic graffiti has been scrawled on 
apartment buildings in the Upper East Side. On the Upper West Side, two 
Jewish women were assaulted after calling out individuals who were 
despicably tearing down posters of Israeli hostages.
  Last week in Brooklyn, three attackers violently attacked a 15-year-
old Jewish boy, yelling, ``Free Palestine'' as they punched and kicked 
the stranger.
  This anti-Semitic hate is happening across the country. The Oakland 
City Council rejected a bid to denounce Hamas, as speaker after speaker 
espoused dangerously misguided and factually erroneous views at a 
deeply troubling anti-Semitic public hearing.
  Since the Israel-Hamas war began, the GOP has seemed gleeful at their 
partisan wedging at the expense of the Jewish community, and they have 
utterly failed to do anything serious to address this crisis. If they 
object to my charges, let me ask them here today three key questions:
  First, what have my friends on the other side of the aisle--the only 
ones who actually control the agenda on the floor--done to implement 
the White House's National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism? This 
historic whole-of-government plan, which has bipartisan support, has 
been completely ignored in this dysfunctional MAGA-extremist Congress. 
The answer is clear: They have done nothing.
  Second, when will the GOP majority stop its efforts to defund the 
Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, the office that must 
protect Jewish students from the horrendous discrimination they face on 
campus today? In order to enforce title VI, the law that prevents such 
discrimination in education, the Department needs the resources to put 
legal and investigatory boots on the ground. The answer: The majority 
still supports defunding this office, and that means Jewish students 
will remain at terrible risk.
  Third, what will the GOP do to ensure that the high-risk Nonprofit 
Security Grant Program run through the Department of Homeland Security 
has a meaningful increase in funding? This program keeps our synagogues 
and Hebrew schools safe across the country. The answer: House 
Republicans have done absolutely nothing to shore up this program.
  I demand that we take real action. Representatives Goldman, Raskin, 
and I today introduced a resolution which would commit ourselves to the 
full implementation of the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. I 
implore my Republican colleagues to join it. Join us and take concrete 
action.
  I call on them to actually protect Jewish lives by a dramatic 
increase in funding for the Department of Education's Office of Civil 
Rights and the high-risk Nonprofit Security Grant Program. That is what 
taking meaningful action would look like.
  Mr. Speaker, by bringing this resolution to the floor without a 
single Democratic cosponsor, which is extremely unusual, and by rushing 
it to a vote without careful and considerate collaboration, my 
Republican friends have shown us who they are and precisely what are 
their intentions.
  In my three decades in Congress, I have voted on numerous bills and 
resolutions addressing anti-Semitism, including my own. I have never 
seen an anti-Semitism-focused vehicle come to the floor without the 
cosponsorship of a single member of the minority party.
  The House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism doesn't 
support such partisan gamesmanship, nor does the Anti-Defamation 
League, nor does the American Jewish Committee. With this resolution, 
the GOP has shown themselves fundamentally unserious about combating 
anti-Semitism. Of course, none of us should be surprised.
  If our friends on the other side of the aisle were serious about 
combating anti-Semitism, they would have spoken up when former 
President Trump called the Nazis in Charlottesville very fine people. 
They would have condemned the former President when he dined with known 
Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. Chairman Jordan would have thought 
better before tweeting out ``Kanye, Elon, Trump,'' sending out dog 
whistles to their white supremacist, anti-Semitic base.
  They also would have chosen their recent witnesses more carefully. 
Chairman Jordan chose to give a platform to Robert Kennedy, Jr., just 
days after he trafficked in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories suggesting 
Jews were responsible for COVID.
  I cannot help but note that although this resolution strongly 
condemns and denounces anti-Semitism, its authors carefully avoided 
mentioning any of the obvious instances of anti-Semitism coming from 
their own leaders.
  The resolution is flawed in other ways, as well. For example, the 
resolution implicitly compares some peaceful protesters with the 
January 6 rioters and insurrectionists. I suppose they have their 
reasons for that.
  More problematically, the resolution suggests that all anti-Zionism--
it states that all anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism. That is either 
intellectually disingenuous or just factually wrong. It unfairly 
implicates many of my orthodox former constituents in Brooklyn, many of 
whose families rose from the ashes of the Holocaust.
  While most anti-Zionism is indeed anti-Semitic, the authors, if they 
were at all familiar with Jewish history and culture, should know about 
Jewish anti-Zionism that was and is expressly not anti-Semitic. This 
resolution ignores the fact that even today certain orthodox Hasidic 
Jewish communities--the Satmars in New York and others--as well as 
adherents of the prestate Jewish labor movement have held views that 
are at odds with the modern Zionist conception.
  According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, ``the anti-Zionist world-view 
of the ultra-Orthodox groups . . . '' like the ``Satmar Hasidism 
perceives Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel as an 
anti-messianic act . . . '' That is to say that these ultra-orthodox 
Hasidic Jews believe that only the Messiah can bring about the true 
Israel, and I assure you the Satmar Hasidic Jews are certainly not 
anti-Semitic.

[[Page H6108]]

  I should also note that there are those who try to smear even 
progressive pro-Israel supporters with the inappropriate label of 
``Israel hater'' or ``anti-Zionist.'' Under this resolution, those who 
love Israel deeply but criticize some of its policy approaches could be 
considered anti-Zionist. That could make every Democratic Jewish Member 
of this body--because they all criticized the recent Israeli judicial 
reform package--de facto anti-Semites. Might that be the authors' 
intention?
  Again, let me be unequivocally clear, most anti-Zionism, particularly 
in this moment, has a real anti-Semitism problem, but we cannot fairly 
say that one equals the other.
  As the most senior Jewish Member in this House, with perhaps the 
largest Jewish constituency in this country, I have always and will 
always support real, meaningful legislation to combat anti-Semitism. 
This, of course, is deeply personal for me and for so many of my 
constituents. Indeed, I take a back seat to no one in this body when it 
comes to fighting against this scourge.
  In the aftermath of October 7, we have a moral obligation to act to 
protect our own Jewish citizens and our critical ally Israel. I pray 
that the GOP majority makes today the day that they stop playing these 
partisan games and commit themselves to doing the real work to protect 
Jewish lives. There is not a single minute to spare.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I say briefly that I very much do applaud the gentleman from New 
York, who I think has shown tremendous leadership in many ways in 
standing up for Israel and fighting against anti-Semitism in this 
country.
  I think one of the valuable things that we have seen over the last 
several weeks is that we have had bipartisan support on both counts. I 
actually sponsored a separate resolution dealing specifically with the 
problem of anti-Semitism on college campuses, and that got overwhelming 
bipartisan support on this floor. I think it had only about 21 ``no'' 
votes. That has been very encouraging.
  With respect to the three charges that were mentioned, number one, 
there is legislation in the House right now to codify the President's 
executive order, on which I think it is important that we move forward.
  Number two, far from saying we shouldn't have an Office of Civil 
Rights within the Department of Education, Representative Burgess Owens 
and I wrote a letter to the head of the Office of Civil Rights in the 
Department of Education telling them they need to be doing more, they 
need to be more proactive in looking into anti-Semitic incidents at our 
universities, and we would certainly welcome their support on that 
letter.
  Number three, as far as the protection for synagogues and other 
facilities, I would be very interested in partnering with you on any 
such efforts.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).
  Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution 
that strongly condemns the dramatic rise of anti-Semitism both here in 
our Nation and abroad.
  Last week, I had the privilege and the honor, frankly, of speaking 
with Amir Ohana, who is the Speaker of the Knesset. We discussed a lot 
of things. We talked about how life has changed not only in Israel but 
around the world since Hamas' horrific and brutal terrorist attack 
against Israelis on October 7. We also talked about how we have seen an 
absolute explosion of anti-Semitic incidents, attacks, and harassment 
in Israel, here in our own Nation, and across the world.
  Mr. Speaker, two interesting statistics, if I can: According to the 
Anti-Defamation League, since the Hamas massacre on October 7, anti-
Semitic incidents around our Nation have increased over 400 percent 
compared to the same time period last year.

                              {time}  1730

  The second statistic, Mr. Speaker, more Jews were murdered on October 
7 than on any other single day since the Holocaust. Let that sink in.
  We have seen Members of this very body repeat blatantly anti-Semitic 
rhetoric and spread lies about Israel and her right to exist. Let me be 
absolutely clear: Such hate has no place in the Halls of Congress nor 
in our national discourse.
  It is our fundamental responsibility as leaders and as Members of 
Congress to condemn and fight these horrific acts of hate and 
discrimination against the Jewish community.
  That is why I am proud to work with my colleague, Congressman Max 
Miller, to introduce this critical resolution to condemn and denounce 
all instances of domestic and global anti-Semitism.
  A few months ago, Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity--really, the 
privilege--to take a group of people through the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum.
  A lot of us have been there. It is not too far away from here in the 
Capitol where we are standing. That museum serves not only as a 
reminder of the atrocities that took place during the Holocaust, but it 
also serves as a stark reminder that we can never forget the horrors of 
the Holocaust and that we, as leaders, have an obligation and a duty to 
make sure that it never happens again.
  For these reasons, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support this very simple, yet critical, resolution.
  It is absolutely important that we send a clear and firm message to 
the world that the United States House of Representatives stands 
shoulder to shoulder with the Jewish community here in the United 
States and abroad.
  Mr. Speaker, as Jews around the world celebrate Hanukkah very soon in 
the next few days, we should remember the words of Rabbi Lord Jonathan 
Sacks.
  He said: ``Hanukkah tells us not to curse the darkness, but instead 
to bring light to the world. It tells us to fight back and not be 
afraid.''
  We should truly heed those words. I thank my colleagues for 
supporting this resolution.
  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, we hear in this resolution about the opposition to anti-
Semitism. As I said before, I would be more impressed with the 
sincerity of that opposition if the Republican Party were not trying to 
defund the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, the 
office that enforces title VI to protect Jewish students on campus, and 
if the Republicans were not opposing an increase in funding for the 
Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights and for the high-risk, 
nonprofit security grant program that protects our synagogues and other 
Jewish institutions.
  Mr. Speaker, the rise of anti-Semitism in the United States and 
across the world is a real and growing problem.
  I wish the majority would use its power to actually do something 
about it instead of playing partisan political games.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Kiley) that the House suspend the rules 
and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 894.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed."

  Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, as this body continues to discuss the 
need for a national security supplemental, I rise today to discuss the 
important elements that need to be included in this supplemental and 
to, once again, emphasize the growing demands for increased border 
security in our country.
  For a nation as powerful and as impactful as ours, there are 
obligations that we inherently have to meet, both to ourselves and our 
allies. At the center of these obligations rests defending our 
homeland. This security is imperative to the sovereignty of our Nation, 
with our other obligation being to support our allies abroad as they 
face hostilities. We must realize that these two priorities are deeply 
woven together. We cannot achieve national security as a whole without 
securing our own borders. In fact, President Biden's own national 
defense strategy reflects this very sentiment, citing protection of the 
homeland as the No. 1 defense priority.
  It is essential that border security remains one of our four pillars 
that need to be included in any national security supplemental that is 
approved by this Congress. In order to properly secure and defend our 
allies, we must properly secure and defend our own Nation at the same 
time.
  As I have said on the floor many times, Madam President, with you 
presiding--I have said many times that there is no doubt that we 
currently live in a time of heightened national security concern. Not 
only is this concern felt around the globe but in almost every State 
and community in our own country because of this crisis at the border.
  Because of this crisis at the border, we see chaos. We see it on our 
news channels every evening. We see the monthly records of illegal 
crossings--as a matter of fact, I think several days ago, the highest 
daily number. We see how those who are truly seeking asylum are being 
disadvantaged by the cartels and smugglers who are playing the system.
  It is obvious that the policies which have led to this crisis need to 
be addressed, and they need to be changed and reformed.
  I often talk about American leadership and our historic ability to 
respond with strength in times of crisis. Well, this is a time of 
crisis, and our porous southern border is something we desperately need 
to act upon.
  It is not lost on me or on my Republican colleagues, the urgency to 
address the four central national security emergencies of our time. 
Ukraine is facing an unjust and unprovoked ground war perpetrated by 
Russia. Our ally and friend Israel is under attack by terrorists who 
are holding women and children hostage. The recounting that we have 
heard of the sexual violence against the women in Israel on October 7 
is appalling. Our allies in the Indo-Pacific face heightened concern as 
rival nations increase their aggression. Right here in the United 
States, we are facing the worst border crisis in our Nation's history.
  These four areas are directly tied together. Ukraine's ability to 
defend itself and stave off Russian aggression relates directly to the 
security of Taiwan and the increased posture of China. The terrorist 
attacks perpetrated on Israel have led to attacks on our own U.S. 
military bases and ships, as well as the alarming rise--alarming rise--
of anti-Semitism that we are seeing in our own country.
  Nations directly opposed to the United States--they are opposed to 
our values, our way of life--are building an uneasy level of 
camaraderie between one another. You can guarantee that these nations 
are watching our self-created security crisis at our border and waiting 
to see when we will finally wake up and react. Our country must take 
notice of this.
  The supplemental text before us does not make any policy changes but 
instead just throws more money--more money--at a broken system. That is 
not a solution. It doesn't address the actual policies that are fueling 
this situation.
  The changes in border policy that my party seeks are not ``partisan 
and extreme measures,'' as the Democrat leader would lead you to 
assume, but, rather, they are substantive solutions that address the 
national security threats that we are now facing.
  We encountered a sixfold increase of individuals on our Terror 
Watchlist just in the past year coming to the southern border. Half of 
the illegal encounters now on our border are not from Mexico or the 
Northern Triangle of Central America. Drugs that are made on the other 
side of the world are smuggled into our country daily, with the goal of 
sowing destruction and sorrow. Unfortunately, that is having success. 
We do not know who or what is entering our borders, and that cannot be 
a risk we are willing to take.
  The truth of the matter is, this doesn't need to be a partisan issue, 
and I know we have colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are trying 
to work through this. We are not just talking about funding but, 
rather, changes that ensure that those who enter our country are coming 
through legal channels and that they are properly vetted. It sounds 
pretty simple to me--both things that we should all agree are necessary 
aspects of a working immigration system. But, instead, this 
administration, the Biden administration, has incentivized abuses of 
our asylum laws that have led to the greatest border crisis in our 
Nation's history. It is an open border. It is catch-and-release. This, 
in turn, has put our national security at risk.
  This is not an issue that the Republicans have brought up in the 
eleventh hour of a negotiation but, rather, something that we have 
continued to highlight the entire time President Biden has been in the 
White House.
  Members of Congress cannot continue to ignore the deep ties between 
the sovereignty of the United States and the sovereignty of our allies 
abroad. The supplemental we have been discussing for weeks is about 
helping our allies, but also, why is that important? Because we have to 
advance our own interests at the same time, and the border is a big 
part of our own interests. This is not a time to play games; instead, 
it is time to meet the challenges of the moment. While others refuse to 
accept the reality of the landscape we face, Republicans remain at the 
table.
  For too long--for too long--we have been on the floor voting on 
radical nominations to advance the Biden administration's agenda 
instead of on legislation needed to help solve many of the problems I 
have described, including border security and our weakened defense 
industrial base and, I would add as a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, our appropriations bills, which have been teed up since 
July, and the leader has refused to put them on the floor. All that 
serves to do is waste time we simply do not have.

[[Page S5782]]

  We must seek agreements that address our concerns, that provide 
necessary relief, that strengthen our security, and that will move the 
interests of the United States forward. I ask my colleagues in this 
Chamber to recognize that.
  The time to invest in the national security of the United States and 
our allies abroad is now.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  I see my fellow Senator from Nebraska here to talk about similar 
subjects.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.
  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, earlier this year, I visited our 
Nation's southern border. My colleagues and I joined several patrols to 
see the problems firsthand, and at each of our stops, what we saw was 
very, very alarming. Dozens of people sat on the ground at midnight at 
the border, waiting to go to a crowded processing center for illegal 
immigrants. As we patrolled the Rio Grande Valley, we passed trail 
after trail used by illegal migrants to traffic drugs and people into 
our country. Meanwhile, we walked past an open, unfinished border wall. 
We toured a raided stash house, where a weapon was found, an illegal 
immigrant was detained, and a human smuggler was arrested.
  These experiences--they just scratch the surface of the chaos 
overwhelming our southern border. Our border is a frenzy--a frenzy--of 
illegal activity, and because of neglect and inaction from this 
administration, this disaster is out of control.
  There is a humanitarian crisis at our southern border. There is a 
deadly drug crisis at our southern border. Perhaps most critically, 
there is a national security crisis at our southern border.
  Since President Biden took office, over 8 million migrants have 
illegally crossed our southern border. Border Patrol agents have seized 
over 51,000 pounds of fentanyl. We have seen an uptick in encounters 
with illegal migrants from adversaries like China. That is not even to 
mention the 295--294; I don't want to exaggerate because we don't need 
to exaggerate on numbers like this--the 294 known terrorists who have 
been identified at our border. Hundreds of people on the Terror 
Watchlist are flooding our border. To put those numbers in perspective, 
Border Patrol agents encountered a grand total of 11 people--11 
people--on that list during the 4 years of the last administration.
  My Democratic colleagues support security for Taiwan, they support 
security for Ukraine, and they support security for Israel, but what 
they won't support is basic border security for the United States of 
America. Yesterday's classified briefing on the supplemental 
underscored how ridiculous this is. The United States is the leader of 
the free world. We are supporting the security of our partners and 
allies around the globe. Yet we are told by the Biden administration 
and my Democratic colleagues that we can't support the security at our 
own border? We are told that our own border security is not related to 
this national security supplemental? That is absurd, and the American 
people know that it is absurd.
  Many of my Republican colleagues and I have been willing to 
compromise, but we have had it. We have had it with the evasive answers 
and the total neglect of our own border.
  Border security is not a fringe issue. According to an NBC poll, 53 
percent of voters support more military funding for Taiwan, 55 percent 
support more funding for Ukraine, and 55 percent support more funding 
for Israel, but 74 percent of voters support more funding for our 
border security. That is 20 percent more than anything else that voters 
support in this supplemental.
  My Republican colleagues and I are siding with the American people on 
this funding request. Yes, we should address the conflicts raging 
around our world. We must stand by our allies and our partners. But we 
cannot forget the catastrophic issues that we are seeing on our own 
doorstep. We must secure our own Nation before anything else. If this 
supplemental funding bill truly aims to protect our national security, 
it must address our security from all sides, and the side that is in 
the most dire need of support is our battered and chaotic border.
  But money alone is not going to repair the border. We must make 
commonsense policy changes to address this crisis. Let's tighten our 
asylum standards. Let's limit the use of parole to the required, case-
by-case basis. Let's close the catch-and-release loophole.
  I urge the rest of my colleagues and our President to look at this 
border crisis seriously and to respond with urgency--the urgency that 
this requires. The security supplemental is the right opportunity to do 
so.
  Side with the American voters. Side with common sense, and let us 
protect our border.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.
  Mr. BUDD. Madam President, the forces of evil and instability are on 
the march around the globe. In the Middle East, Hamas massacred more 
than 1,200 Israelis and 33 Americans. Iran, the world's leading state 
sponsor of terrorism, continues to finance, provide training for, and 
authorize attacks against U.S. forces in the region. In Europe, Russia 
continues its brutality against Ukraine and is fomenting conflict in 
the Balkans, further threatening peace and stability in Europe. 
Meanwhile, China is rapidly expanding its military, threatening our 
allies and partners, and stealing billions in Americans' intellectual 
property.
  All this chaos is the result of weakness from the Biden 
administration. Starting in Afghanistan, continuing to this day, this 
administration has put American weakness on full display. As we 
confront a dangerous global situation, we cannot ignore the fact that 
for America to be a strong nation, we must first be strong at home. 
Before we can help countries protect their borders thousands of miles 
away, we must first protect our own borders.
  The biggest threat to our national security right now is the wide-
open southern border. For 3 years, the border has been in a state of 
crisis. We have grown familiar with these numbers, sadly, but they 
remain historic and staggering. Under President Biden, over 8 million 
illegal immigrants have crossed the border. Under President Biden, 
279--I just heard my colleague speak, and she gave an even higher 
number, an accurate number perhaps, an even higher number than 279--
folks on the Terrorist Watchlist have illegally entered our Nation.
  Under President Biden, nearly 50,000 pounds of fentanyl have been 
seized at the southern border. That is nearly enough to kill every man, 
woman, and child in the United States. Given the fact that we are only 
able to interdict 5 to 10 percent of the illegal drugs that cross, our 
country is being overwhelmed with drugs that can kill with just a 2-
milligram dose.
  Under President Biden, there have been 1.8 million known--known--
``got-aways,'' and that is not counting all of the unknown ``got-
aways,'' including terrorists, human traffickers, and other bad actors.
  This crisis has got to be dealt with, and we have got to deal with it 
now. That is why Senate Republicans have offered the Biden White House 
a deal. Here it is: Include proven border policies in the House-passed 
H.R. 2 in the national security spending package, and you will have our 
support.
  It is a clear pathway, but, so far, this White House is more 
interested in playing politics and continuing to ignore the border 
crisis altogether.
  But you know who can't ignore it? The Border Patrol agents, who are 
under siege right now.
  In the times that I have been down there--multiple times--they have 
told me that, yes, we need a wall. We need border enforcement. We need 
funding. But what we really need--in their own words--is policy, policy 
changes that would empower them to stop the illegal flow of people, 
crime, drugs.
  You know who can't ignore this crisis? The sheriffs from all 100 
North Carolina counties. Many of them have come up to me saying the 
same thing: Every single county in North Carolina is now a border 
county because of Joe Biden's policies.
  The bottom line here is that, in order to be a strong nation, we have 
to have strong borders, and, right now, we don't have that. So I am 
going to call on President Biden to change course, to work with us so 
that we can solve this crisis together. We know what to do. All we need 
is a President who takes this seriously and fulfills his

[[Page S5783]]

oath to protect and defend this country.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.
  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I am of the view that one of the most 
consequential votes that any Senator will make in their time in the 
U.S. Senate is one that we are facing now: the national security 
supplemental. I am here to encourage its passage--a national security 
supplemental to address the crisis at our southern border, to support 
Israel's right to exist, and to counter Russian, Chinese, and Iranian 
aggression.
  Addressing these issues serves our national interests, and it is 
within the capacity of the Senate to mitigate these crises, to reduce 
the consequences of these crises with strong legislation, and to do it 
before the end of the year.
  National security starts with border security, and I applaud my 
Republican colleagues for working to find a consensus on an emergency 
supplemental for addressing the President's failed policies at our 
southern border.
  It is time for Senate Democrats and the White House and Republicans 
to continue their work, to get back to work, and to negotiate a bill 
that can pass the U.S. Senate. We must and we should show the American 
people that the Senate can be an institution that can come together in 
a responsible way to meet the most pressing challenges our Nation 
faces.
  I saw a headline in the Wall Street Journal here recently: Does 
Congress even work these days? It is a call, a responsibility, that 
reminds us that we have serious and significant work to do together. 
Those pressing needs, those challenges we face, are support for Israel 
to defend itself against terrorism, resources for Ukraine, and policy 
changes to secure our southern border.
  First, it is in our Nation's best interest to stand with our oldest 
ally in the Middle East, Israel. Hamas has stated its intent to wipe 
Israel off the map, even saying the terrorist attacks of October 7 were 
just the beginning. Now is not the time to waver in our support for 
Israel. We must provide Israel with the means to defend itself and 
destroy the terrorists.
  The United States must also work to prevent escalation from Iran and 
other adversaries who may use this opportunity to escalate the war 
against Israel. Hezbollah, entrenched in Lebanon, to the north of 
Israel's border, will find no safe harbor if it attempts to intervene. 
Iran's leaders must know that the fury of the United States awaits if 
they become directly involved. We will stand against terrorism and its 
enablers and supporters.
  Second, the success of Ukraine's defense against ongoing Russian 
invasion is vital to the national interests of the United States. The 
success of Ukraine is vital to the interests of our own country. Should 
Russia fully conquer Ukraine, which remains Putin's goal, more Russian 
forces would be spread across NATO's border, requiring more resources 
from the West--America and our allies in Europe--to be committed to 
defending those allies against further Russian aggression. I don't 
think we can make the mistake. Russia's failure in Ukraine will make 
America safer and will make our allies safer.
  Congress has a critical role in providing the resources necessary not 
just to end the war but ending the war on terms favorable to Ukraine 
and our European allies. To date, a majority of the funding provided to 
Ukraine has been directly injected back into the U.S. economy through 
the development, production, and purchase of U.S.-made weapons to 
replenish U.S. stockpiles.
  Following the leadership of the United States, European nations are 
helping shoulder the burden to support Ukraine's military and have made 
serious commitments to match those of the United States.
  Supporting our partners and allies abroad cannot come at the price of 
ignoring the security interests faced here at home. The 
administration's failure to control the border has created not just a 
humanitarian crisis but a national security crisis. The crushing influx 
of illegal border crossings has included an increase in the number of 
encounters between U.S. Border Patrol agents and individuals the FBI 
has on its Terrorist Watchlist.
  Our border is a humanitarian problem, but it is a problem for the 
well-being of the United States and its national security interests as 
well. As of September 15, border agents have encountered more than 150 
individuals on the Terrorist Screening Database at the southern border. 
These levels of encounters are astonishing, considering there were only 
11 such encounters with these dangerous individuals from 2017 to 2020.
  I have been on the border, I think, at least three times in the last 
year or so, and from conversations with, certainly, our Border Patrol 
agents but also our law enforcement agents as well, the number of 
illegal and foreigners coming into the United States who have the 
potential of providing terrorist threats and acting on terrorist 
behavior in the United States is only growing.
  Our lack of operational control over the border has exacerbated the 
drug crisis, as we know, in our communities as well. The border is the 
single most important line of defense in disrupting these drug 
trafficking and distribution networks, and it is no overstatement to 
say American lives depend on a regulated border.
  Madam President, I stand ready with my Republican colleagues, as they 
do, to find substantive proposals to mitigate this crisis. During an 
Appropriations hearing last month, I was dismayed that Secretary 
Mayorkas chose not to engage on the issues and, instead, fell back on 
the argument for comprehensive immigration reform.
  I agree that major changes to our immigration code are in order and 
have agreed to that belief since my earliest days in Congress. However, 
since I have been in Congress, we keep waiting for comprehensive 
reform, and, as a result, we do nothing--nothing to make our country 
safer, nothing to mitigate the humanitarian crisis unfolding on our 
soil, nothing to increase our national security.
  Support for Ukraine and defending our southern border are not 
mutually exclusive. We can and must do both. It is time to come 
together and resolve our differences on these urgent national security 
issues. The most sustainable and responsible route to a safer and more 
secure United States requires the Senate to take seriously our borders 
and ensure that our partners and allies are prepared and equipped to 
defend themselves against our enemies.
  To my constituents in Kansas and across the country, this is a 
dangerous world we live in, and the decisions that we make in the next 
few days and few weeks--certainly, in the next month--have a 
consequence on the safety and security of Americans today and Americans 
in the future.
  This ought not be a U.S. Senate that doesn't do its work. We ought to 
continue the efforts until we get a result, and I hope that occurs 
quickly.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Rosen). The Senator from Wyoming.
  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I rise today to talk about America's 
wide-open southern border. I want to add my voice to that of the senior 
Senator from Kansas who just made eloquent remarks right here on the 
floor of the Senate about the disaster--the Democratic disaster--at the 
southern border.
  As he pointed out--and as I will add my voice to his--it is a clear 
and present danger to our national security what is happening at the 
southern border. And national security starts with border security.
  The senior Senator from Kansas and I were just meeting with other 
Republican Members of the Senate to review yesterday's numbers at the 
southern border--the number of illegal immigrants coming into this 
country--an all-time record high of over 12,000 illegal immigrants 
coming into this country from all over the world.
  That is the crisis that people all across the country who tune in to 
their TV see is happening in our Nation and to our Nation.
  So here we are on the floor of the Senate, and Senator Schumer, the 
majority leader, wants to vote on $100 billion in national security 
assistance--and he wants to do it today, and we are going to do it 
today.
  That request lacks serious and significant changes that are needed to 
secure the southern border. Without serious and significant changes, 
this bill

[[Page S5784]]

will not pass. Mark my words, Republicans will vote against it.
  Republicans and Democrats have very opposing views of what is needed 
at the border. Republicans want to stop the flow--and it is actually a 
flood--of illegal immigrants coming across the border. Democrats want 
to just wave them on through.
  Republicans want border enforcement, border security, real policy 
changes to keep people out and to keep communities safe. We don't have 
that today in Democratic and Joe Biden's-run America from the 
standpoint of the White House and the Democrats in this body.
  What do Democrats want to do? Oh, they want lots of money for 
sanctuary cities, big slush funds. Give it to the mayor of Chicago. 
Give to it the mayor of New York. And, of course, they want guaranteed 
benefits for illegal immigrants. That is what they are asking for. They 
are not going to get a Republican vote for that at all, not a single 
one.
  Republicans know that border security must be a key element of any 
bill that we talk about on this floor that deals with national 
security.
  For my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who may ask why, let 
me clarify.
  Our southern border is now the most dangerous border crossing in the 
world--in the world. Under President Biden, our border has become a 
magnet for criminals, for drug dealers, for terror suspects.
  The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are warning all of 
us. Democrats may want to cover their ears and not want to hear any of 
these warnings, but we are being warned by the Department of Homeland 
Security and the FBI. And the FBI Director said it yesterday in the 
Senate: Cartels are smuggling fentanyl in from Mexico. It is killing 
hundreds of Americans every day.
  The number coming on the Terrorist Watchlist continues to increase. I 
think it was the head of the FBI yesterday who said: Since October 7, 
all lights are flashing red for a terrorist attack in America.
  Joe Biden's border policies are the deadliest, the most destructive, 
and the most disastrous in American history. The cost of this crisis is 
too large to bear for families, for communities, and even for law 
enforcement.
  That is why Republicans are so focused when there was a bill on the 
floor--and we had a secure briefing yesterday on national security. 
That is why Republicans are so focused on border security.
  Democrats have not put a single bill on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
this year that would stop the flood of illegal immigrants. Democrats 
seem to welcome this national security crisis at the southern border. 
It is wrong. It must change.
  The Biden administration hides behind terms, terms such as ``asylum'' 
and ``parole.'' And they use those to release millions and millions of 
people onto our streets, into our communities, into our neighborhoods. 
And they are bringing with them drugs and crime. And they are killing 
Americans. The Biden administration wants to turn the other way.
  Every single American feels the harmful impacts of these policies. 
Here is what is happening thousands of times each and every day on our 
southern border--and yesterday it was 12,000, the highest in the 
history of the country, coming in across the southern border. And they 
are coming from all over the world.
  The night I was there on border patrol about 3 or 4 weeks ago, who 
did we see? People from all around the world, including a group from 
Moldova. Do you know how many countries they had to go through before 
they could get to Mexico to come to the United States and pay the 
cartels to bring them in? That is what we are seeing every day at the 
southern border.
  Democrats don't go down there. Oh, no, they are not interested in 
actually seeing firsthand what is happening on the Rio Grande River at 
night and during the day. Not interested.
  Border Patrol agents say, Democrats never show up. Not one time.
  So individuals enter the U.S. illegally. And they immediately turn 
themselves into Border Patrol. These are the ones who aren't trying to 
get away. There is over a million of those too. And what they do when 
they give themselves up, they claim they are in danger at home.
  And then what happens? Well, they are released into the streets of 
the United States. OK. Oh, you may be in danger. Oh, you got the magic 
words. OK. Here you go. Come right on in. Ten thousand times a day. 
Twelve thousand times yesterday. And Joe Biden allows it to happen. And 
the Democrats encourage him.
  Some Democrats have finally started to admit Biden's policies are 
actually harming our country. So President Obama's Homeland Security 
Secretary Jeh Johnson told fellow Democrats that the manipulation of 
our asylum laws--because that is what Biden is doing, it is a 
manipulation of our asylum laws--is one of the root causes of illegal 
immigration.
  At one time, Jeh Johnson said a thousand a day would be overwhelming. 
Well, it was 12,000 yesterday. Why aren't the Democrats waking up?
  Senator Schumer, who sits at that desk right there, stands at that 
podium, and will later today--his hometown mayor--hometown mayor--New 
York City, Eric Adams said: The flood of illegal immigrants is 
destroying New York City. Destruction of New York City, and Democrats 
stand by.
  Now, they do want to give a lot of money there, but they sure don't 
want to enforce the law at the border.
  Chicago is another one of these cities that--Democrats are fearful of 
having next summer's Democratic National Convention in Chicago. I 
wonder how many Members of this body are actually going to go, because 
Democrats across the country are afraid of doing it because Chicago is 
being overrun right now with illegal immigrants--overrun and 
overwhelmed.
  We want to make our country safer, and Republicans do. I am not so 
sure about Democrats at this point from the way they are behaving with 
regard to the border. We want to make our country safer. We need to 
pass serious border security policy changes. Republicans know that we 
must end the incentives that are fueling the Biden border crisis.
  And more money to these sanctuary cities and more government benefits 
to illegal immigrants is not solving the problem. It is inviting more 
illegal immigrants to come.
  This is a deadly serious situation. I am not so sure the Democrats 
who were at the secure briefing yesterday all understood that. I am not 
sure the Senate majority leader understands that.
  Real border security is a top national security need. Republicans 
have solutions to make our communities and our countries safer. These 
measures must be included in any national security bill, anything that 
goes to the President's desk, because without them, there will not be a 
national security bill.
  The Republicans are ready to vote against what Chuck Schumer is 
bringing to the floor because it fails to defend our borders and to 
keep our Nation secure.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.
  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I will just pick up where my colleague 
left off.
  There are four parts to the supplemental appropriations sent over by 
President Biden. One deals with Ukraine. And count me in for Ukraine. 
Robust aid to Ukraine really helps us here at home. Helping Israel--no-
brainer--count me in. Beefing up Taiwan makes perfect sense. There was 
money in the supplemental for border security, but it really didn't 
address the problem we have.
  And here is what I want the body to understand. Here is what happened 
yesterday. The FBI Director testified before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee about the level of threats we face as a nation. And he said:

       [W]hile there may have been times over the years where 
     individual threats could have been higher here or there than 
     where they might be right now, I've never seen a time where 
     all the threats or so many of the threats are all elevated, 
     all at exactly the same time.

  This was yesterday.
  What did he say?

       Post October 7--

  The horrible attack on our friends in Israel--


[[Page S5785]]


  

       [Y]ou've seen a veritable rogues' gallery of terrorist 
     organizations calling for attacks against us.

  He said that yesterday.

       [T]he threat level has gone to a whole other level since 
     October 7.
  This was what the FBI Director said yesterday. Are any of us 
listening?

       I see blinking lights everywhere I turn.

  I asked him about blinking lights regarding 9/11. Apparently, they 
were blinking, and we missed them.
  Do you see any blinking lights?
  And he said:

       I see blinking lights everywhere I turn.

  He said that yesterday. Now, why are Republicans, apparently, more 
than anybody else, insisting that the supplemental package not only 
help Ukraine, not only help Israel and Taiwan but actually help us? We 
have got to change the policy because what we have got is not working.
  Yesterday--yesterday--12,000 encounters at the border. The highest 
ever, yesterday. Two days before, 10,000 were marching in the wrong 
direction.
  As these numbers go to new levels and historic levels, the FBI 
Director yesterday told us he has never seen more threats against our 
homeland than he does today.
  And since October 7, every terrorist group in the world is calling 
for an attack on America.
  I asked him about the border. He is very concerned about the status 
of the border.
  So we are on track, if this continues, to have 3.6 million illegal 
encounters that we know of at the border. That is like beyond 
unsustainable. All-time highs every day.
  From 2023 to 2020, the encounters at the border are up 368 percent. 
Why? Because the policies of the Biden administration make people 
believe that if they get to our border, they stay in America and never 
leave. And if you don't change that, you are never going to fix the 
problem.
  Six million people have already come to our border in the first 3 
years of the Biden administration. We are on track to do 3.6 million in 
fiscal year `24.
  The day that people think Trump is going to be the nominee and could 
win the White House, you are going to see a run on the border like you 
have never seen because people want to get the last good deal under the 
Biden administration. Because when Trump wins, if he does, all this is 
going to change.
  There are two problems that have to be fixed. You make an asylum 
claim in America at the border; you pass the initial credible fear 
standard, which needs to be elevated; you are released into the country 
to go to your hearing regarding your asylum claim 3 to 5 years later--
that makes people believe they are released, and they will never show 
up. Once you are here, you are never going to leave. We have to change 
that.
  While you are waiting for your hearing that may be 3 to 5 years away, 
you need to wait outside the country. That would stop a lot of the 
illegal immigrant flow because when people realize you can't wait in 
America, you are home free once you make your asylum claim, they will 
be less likely to pay $10,000 or more to wait in Mexico or some other 
country for 4 or 5 years.
  The second thing is that this administration is abusing the law. The 
Secretary of DHS has the ability on a case-by-case basis to allow 
urgent humanitarian parole for urgent humanitarian reasons or 
significant public benefit. This is meant to be an individual case-by-
case analysis. They are using this concept--the Biden administration--
to have blanket humanitarian parole for 240,000 people from four 
different countries. That is an abuse of the law. This law is being 
used to just flow people through, and that needs to change.
  So if you put a cap on how many people could come into the country 
through humanitarian parole, getting back to the original intent of the 
law, and you told people if you apply for asylum, you have to wait 
outside the country before your hearing is held, then you will have a 
dramatic reduction in illegal immigration. I know that works. That 
doesn't fix a broken immigration system, but it does give us control 
over an out-of-control border at a time of elevated threats.
  To my Democratic colleagues, I have been negotiating with you for 20 
years on how to fix an immigration system that is broken. You need more 
legal immigration. You need border security. You have to have a pathway 
to citizenship for those who are deserving. I get all that. This is not 
all about an immigration reform negotiation; this is about securing the 
border at a time of heightened threat to our country.
  One hundred seventy-two people on the Terrorist Watchlist we know of 
have been caught. Only God knows how many we missed. This run on the 
border is locking the Border Patrol down just processing people, 
fentanyl poisoning of Americans is at an alltime high, 100,000 people 
have died because fentanyl is coming through a broken border. So to my 
Democratic colleagues, this is not about immigration; it is about 
national security. There are ways to fix this problem if you choose to 
do it. I want to help Ukraine. I want to help Taiwan. I want to help 
Israel. But we have got to help ourselves.
  There will never be a bill I will vote for to help other countries 
that are very deserving until we control our own border that is 
completely broken. You need to understand that, and the public is with 
us. Most Americans would like to have their border more controlled, not 
less, and what you are doing is not working.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The Senator from Oklahoma.
  Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 12,080, it is not just a random 
number; it is the highest number of crossings ever in a single day 
across our southwest border. That is the record, 12,080. We have never 
had a day more than 12,080 crossing our southwest border.
  You might ask: What day did we set the record for the most number of 
crossings across our southern border? And my answer would be yesterday. 
Yesterday was the highest number of illegal crossings in the history of 
the country. September was the highest September ever in the history of 
the country for illegal crossings.
  October was the highest October ever in the United States in the 
history of illegal crossings. November was the highest November ever in 
the country in the history of our Nation for illegal crossings. And 
there is the highest number ever in the history of the country--
yesterday.
  What is really happening? The numbers continue to be able to 
skyrocket. If we look at what is actually occurring with the number of 
illegal crossings, they continue to accelerate day after day, month 
after month, unchecked.
  We face very real threats in our Nation, and it is not just me saying 
that. People may recognize the FBI Director, Christopher Wray, who just 
this week in a hearing was asked about the threats that we are facing 
in the United States after October 7. He was asking what he saw with 
that, and his answer was, ``I see blinking red lights everywhere.''
  ``The threat level has gone to a whole other level since October 7,'' 
in the United States.
  Yesterday, of those 12,080 people who illegally crossed the border, 
the vast majority of them were released into the country today. They 
had no criminal background check. They didn't have to prove their ID of 
what country they were from because right now the soft-sided facilities 
that are housing migrants all along our southern border are currently 
running at 400 percent occupancy.
  So the goal is, get them through and into the country, hand them a 
piece of paper, and--literally--ask them to promise to turn themselves 
in, in the future at some point, just go because we need your space 
because there are more people coming.
  At the same time the FBI Director is saying, ``I see blinking red 
lights everywhere,'' we are literally releasing thousands of people, 
day after day, no criminal background check, no evaluation of their 
history--many of them we don't even know what country they are from--
and releasing them into the country.
  In the last 2 years, this White House has designated on our southwest 
border

[[Page S5786]]

70,000 people they designated as what they call ``special interest 
aliens.'' These are individuals who are coming from areas known for 
terrorism, but we had no background information on these individuals.
  What happened to those 70,000 individuals? They were released into 
our country with a piece of paper saying: Please turn yourself in, in 
the days ahead, because we have no room to be able to house you here. 
That is what is happening.
  Am I the only one who noticed this? Well, let's see, the mayor of El 
Paso has said that ``the city of El Paso only has so many resources and 
we have come to . . . a breaking point right now.''
  The mayor of New York City is talking about this, and he said that 
``this issue will destroy New York City,'' as they are over capacity in 
every spot that they have got.
  The mayor of Chicago has called this an ``international crisis'' that 
he is actually experiencing in Chicago to try to be able to manage 
this.
  As the stories come out on this over and over again, this is a New 
York Times story that came out:

       Migrant-smuggling is now a $13 billion business. Mangled 
     limbs. Raped women. Congressional inaction is a boon to bad 
     actors.

  From the New York Times.
  So my question is, What are we going to do about this? Currently, it 
has been nothing.
  So what are we going to do about this? About 6 weeks ago, the White 
House sent over a request for supplemental funding. They labeled it a 
national security supplemental. They asked for funding for Israel, for 
Ukraine, for the Indo-Pacific, and for border security. In fact, what 
is interesting is the second highest request they put in the entire 
piece was actually for border security. And then literally within days, 
the administration put out an op-ed that said the funding request for 
border security is a tourniquet. What we really need is a change in 
policy.
  That same day, Ali Mayorkas from Homeland Security, President Biden's 
Homeland Security Director, was in front of a hearing that I was in. I 
asked him some very specific questions during that:

       What are the things that need to be able to change [in our 
     system]?

  He said:

       Senator, we need . . . the ability to remove individuals 
     who do not qualify [for asylum] with efficiency and [with] 
     speed.

  Secretary Mayorkas went on to say:

       The asylum system needs to be reformed from top to bottom.

  I asked him again:
  [Are] policy changes needed?
  Secretary Mayorkas said:

       Yes, policy changes are needed.

  The issue is not is the need there. The issue is not is there a 
problem in our immigration system. The issue is not is this a crisis at 
our border. Everyone knows that it is a crisis that literally the 
people working on our border have no tools in their hands to be able to 
stop this issue.
  This needs a solution from Congress, and it requires all of us having 
the determination to say: 12,080 people that crossed our border 
yesterday is not sustainable.
  So what is the request? It is pretty straightforward. It is what 
anyone would look at and, quite frankly, what DHS has talked about for 
years--not just this DHS; the Trump DHS, the Obama DHS have all asked 
for these issues.
  They are looking for some very basic things. They want to know how to 
be able to manage the asylum requests. That accelerated and took off 
during the late half of the Obama administration.
  If I can take us back in history to ancient history, in 2010, there 
were 21,000 people who asked for asylum a year on our southern border--
21,000 people a year in 2010. That is now every 2 days of what we are 
facing now.
  What the request was, at the end of the second term of the Obama 
administration, was that we have got to reform our asylum system. We 
have got to be able to process people at the border. We have got to be 
able to not change the rules of what asylum means but change when we 
actually do the screening--do it right there, to be able to manage 
those issues, so that people who qualify for asylum under our law are 
able to come into our country lawfully and people who do not qualify 
for asylum cannot come into our country unlawfully.
  We all know it is happening. Every administration has identified it. 
So far, this body has been unwilling to be able to act on it.
  We also know that, every day, the cartels actually run our southern 
border. They are a ruthless criminal organization that we have 
experienced firsthand in my State. There is drug smuggling. There is 
human trafficking and what they have done to literally millions of 
people whom they have trafficked from around the world. We need to take 
control of our border, not give control to the cartels.
  I would challenge anyone in this body to be able to go to our 
southwest border and ask any Border Patrol agent: Do we have control of 
our border?
  Most every one of them will respond the same way, because I have 
heard it over and over. There is situational control of our border. It 
is just on the south side, not on the north side, because the cartels 
are managing who is actually coming in, in what order, and how it is 
actually done. And they are paid, as the New York Times article 
detailed, billions of dollars to be able to traffic people into our 
country. They are the ones who are managing it.
  So the simple, straightforward issue is, As the United States of 
America, are we going to manage our border or are the cartels going to 
manage our border? Are we going to be able to have a system where we 
allow people who qualify for asylum to actually get a hearing on a 
timely basis or are we going to take people and push them into the 
country? And then real, legitimate asylum seekers don't get a hearing 
for years, and people who don't qualify for asylum--and we all know 
it--disappear into the country and live underground.
  This is the decision that we have got to come to. President Biden 
asked for a national security supplemental and included into that 
border funding and then a request for policy changes. It is time to be 
able to address this issue.
  And I will tell you what I will vote later on today. Republicans are 
going to speak clearly to say: We will not move to a national security 
bill that does security for other nations and ignores our own. We will 
not do it.
  And we believe the American people, regardless of party--I don't find 
many people who want chaos on our southern border. They want an orderly 
process. I also don't find people who are opposed to immigration. They 
are just opposed to illegal activity on our border, unchecked activity 
on our border.
  So let's get back to an orderly process. Let's have a system that 
actually works for everybody in the process, and let's not put the 
national security for other nations ahead of the national security of 
Americans. Let's do it together.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.
  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I first want to say that, as we 
proceed on the initial vote today--and I support the President's 
package, including the work on border security--I do appreciate the 
Senator from Oklahoma's work in trying to reach an agreement. So many 
of us want to see an agreement on border security.
  I rise today to highlight another part of that agreement that is very 
important, and that is the importance of the critical humanitarian aid 
in the supplemental funding request, and to urge my colleagues to 
include it in a final bill.
  Throughout history, the United States has been a leader. When Hitler 
sought to conquer Europe, American's Lend-Lease Program ensured 
democracy triumphed over fascism, and it was our Marshall Plan that 
gave our European partners the resources they needed to rebuild after 
the war. When the Iron Curtain fell, American aid kept communism at 
bay. And, to this day, Agencies like USAID give nations across the 
globe the support they need to alleviate poverty, become stronger 
trading partners with our country, and recover from disasters.
  We know that humanitarian aid, yes, saves lives in such a big way, 
but it is also important for our own country. It is our own security 
that we make friends. It actually helps us to spend

[[Page S5787]]

less on military when we spend more on humanitarian aid.
  Today, armed conflict is tearing apart families and neighborhoods in 
the Middle East, and the largest land war in Europe since World War II 
rages on. Ripples from these conflicts are felt around the world. We 
are at a pivotal moment in not just American history but the history of 
humanity.
  Israelis, innocent Palestinians, and Ukrainians are looking to us for 
support, and the whole world is watching. It is during moments like 
these that leaders are called to step up. So the question before us 
today that so many of those who came before us in this Chamber--
Democrats and Republicans--have grappled with is, Will we step up? Will 
America step up? My answer: We must, just as we have time and time 
again throughout history.
  That, of course, includes providing swift humanitarian aid to people 
across the world, including innocent civilians in Gaza.
  Like so many in this Chamber, including the Presiding Officer, I 
strongly condemned Hamas's terrorist attack immediately, in the 
strongest terms. It was a massacre of innocent Israelis, and I am 
heartbroken by the devastation and the loss of life. But we must 
remember that the violence of this terrorist group Hamas does not 
represent the will of all of the people of Gaza, not by any means.
  That is why I joined my colleagues in calling for a short-term 
cessation of hostilities in order to allow for the Hamas-held hostages 
to be released and to ensure that humanitarian assistance could reach 
innocent civilians in Gaza. I welcomed, as so many did, the 
announcement almost 2 weeks ago that Israel and Hamas had agreed to 
release more than 100 hostages during the cessation that would also 
allow, of course, for increased aid for food and the like into Gaza. 
Tragically, late last week, a continued agreement could not be reached, 
and the hostages, including, as we now know, so many young women--with 
very troubling and concerning reports coming out on their conditions--
are still being held hostage by the terrorists. The fighting has begun 
again.
  The United States has provided significant aid to both Israel and the 
Palestinian people, now and in years past, but we know we cannot shirk 
from our duties. We cannot turn our backs on what is happening.
  In discussing the need for foreign aid, we must not forget the 
continued importance, as we will discuss later today, of standing with 
Ukraine as Ukrainians fight back against Vladimir Putin's inhuman 
barbarism. For almost 2 years, in bright blue and yellow, the 
Ukrainians have shown the world what it truly means to fight for 
freedom, and America has been with them, as have so many of our allies. 
Beyond critical military aid, the United States has continued to 
support Ukraine through humanitarian assistance for both internally 
displaced Ukrainians and those who have been forced to flee their home 
country.

  And we know that while we have taken in some of these refugees, 
including in my home State of Minnesota, which has a major Ukrainian 
population, many of whom are now working--I was just with a number of 
them who work in our Ukrainian restaurant that we are so proud of, 
Kramarczuk's in Minneapolis. We also have European countries taking in 
these refugees in unprecedented numbers--millions and millions of 
people.
  When I visited Poland with a group of our colleagues on a bipartisan 
basis, just weeks after Vladimir Putin launched his brutal invasion, 
there were more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees. Today, that number 
is more than 6 million. I will never forget talking to those refugees--
women, children, seniors, kids with nothing but a backpack on their 
back with a stuffed animal in it. We heard their horror stories about 
homes lost, families ripped apart, and lives destroyed.
  We know that Polish people don't have to imagine what it is like to 
live through a full-scale invasion. Their history is marked by 
invasions by Prussia, the Hapsburgs, the Nazi, and, yes, Russia. As our 
Ambassador to Poland, Mark Brzezinski told us, the Poles are achieving 
the dreams their grandparents never could realize.
  Poland is able to say to their Ukrainian neighbors: We value freedom 
and respect your democracy. We value you so much that we will take you 
into our homes and into our hearts. We will open our doors and not shut 
you out.
  Just as our Polish allies and those small countries that I met with 
yesterday--the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania--they 
are there for Ukraine on the ground and taking in their people and 
being on the frontline and putting in an extraordinary percentage of 
their own resources, of their spending, into defense, into NATO. 
America must be there for Ukraine by providing, yes, topnotch military 
assistance, as we have to enable Ukraine to retake half of the 
territory that Vladimir Putin took in his initial invasion, but we also 
must be there for them with critical humanitarian aid. Our Ukrainian 
friends continue to persevere against all odds, against one of the 
largest armies in the world, and this aid is critical to that effort.
  As we all know, the consequences of Putin's unprovoked, unlawful, 
unjustifiable war extend beyond Ukraine's border. Ukraine is one of the 
world's top suppliers of grain, and Russia's illegal blockade of 
Ukrainian ports has put millions of people across the globe, in places 
like Africa, at risk of starvation. By providing critical support for 
the State Department's refugee aid program, including food assistance, 
the administration funding request will support displaced people around 
the world.
  Our Nation has earned its reputation as the leader of the free world 
due to its unwavering commitment to democracy and helping nations when 
they need it--knowing they come out of it; knowing they become major 
trading partners and friends of ours on the security front, on the 
democracy front, and on the economic front. So now it is on us to 
decide if we want to keep that reputation, if we want to keep that 
leadership.
  As we negotiate this bill, the supplemental, I am reminded of what 
President Zelenskyy said just hours after Vladimir Putin launched his 
barbaric invasion. Everyone counted him out. Everyone thought he was 
going to run. Instead, he stood on the streets of Kyiv, with just a few 
people, and looked straight into the camera and delivered a simple 
message that was, all at once, a rallying cry to his people, but a 
statement of defiance in the face of evil and a call to action for 
democracies across the globe. Three words: We are here.
  So that is our decision over the next 2 weeks. Are we going to be 
here for democracy? Are we going to be here for our ally in the Mideast 
and our allies around the world? Are we going to continue to feed the 
world? Are we going to continue to stand up against terrorism and 
barbarism and help innocent people, like those in Gaza, those in 
Ukraine, and those around the world who depend on us?
  Moms, dads, grandmas, grandpas, kids, and grandkids are depending on 
us. We must be there. We must say: We are here.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.
  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, nearly 2 months after Hamas launched 
brutal terrorist attacks on Israel, we continue to grieve for those who 
were killed, and we also pray for the return of loved ones taken 
hostage. And for those who have been injured, for rape victims, and for 
those who survived by hiding themselves among dead and dying friends, 
we offer love and support.
  October 7 was the deadliest day for Jewish people since the 
Holocaust. I have seen video of Hamas's attack and their terrorists' 
contempt for Israeli' lives. As I have said before, Israel has both a 
right to defend its citizens from Hamas's terrorist attacks and an 
obligation under the laws of war to protect innocent Palestinian 
civilians in Gaza. Palestinians are not Hamas, and they should not be 
punished for Hamas's terrorism.
  I want to be clear about how I see the war that Israel is currently 
waging in Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu and his rightwing war cabinet 
have created a humanitarian catastrophe, killing thousands of 
Palestinian civilians and risking a wider conflict in the Middle East.
  The Gaza Health Ministry estimates that more than 15,000 people in 
Gaza

[[Page S5788]]

have been killed and more than 40,000 injured. The vast majority of 
those killed and injured have been Palestinian civilians, many of them 
women and children. This level of civilian harm is a moral failure. It 
is why for weeks I have called on Israel to stop bombing Gaza.
  A 7-day cease-fire between Israel and Hamas gave hope that more 
hostages would return to their loved ones, gave hope that a massive 
amount of humanitarian aid would reach innocent Palestinians in need of 
food and water, and gave hope that negotiations would continue as the 
parties worked toward an enduring end to this fighting.
  I applauded this cease-fire and urged its extension so that the 
parties could secure a lasting peace.
  When the cease-fire lapsed, I urged the parties to get back to the 
negotiating table and build on the prior agreement so that the cease-
fire could resume, but, instead, the fighting ramped up.
  So I will say it again. Hamas must release the hostages and stop 
firing rockets at civilians in Israel. The Israeli Government must stop 
the bombing in Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid. All of us must do 
everything possible to resume the cease-fire and extend it for as long 
as possible.
  The long-term goal must be peace--two states for two peoples.
  Today, the Senate will vote on legislation to provide military 
funding to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. I will support this legislation 
because Ukraine is on the frontlines, fighting back a brutal Russian 
invasion that would destroy its existence as an independent nation.
  A few months ago, I visited Ukraine and saw firsthand the courage of 
the Ukrainian people, who are literally putting their lives on the line 
to keep democracy alive.
  This legislation also contains $10 billion in humanitarian aid for 
families around the globe, including in Gaza. It also provides 
emergency shelter funds for migrants who are newly arrived in the 
United States. It includes money for mosques and synagogues that are 
dealing with threats here at home.
  I strongly support those provisions. In fact, I fought hard for those 
provisions. But I want to be clear that when it comes to U.S. military 
aid to Israel, American support cannot be a blank check to a rightwing 
government that has demonstrated a gross disregard for the lives of 
Palestinian civilians. U.S. military aid always includes conditions, 
and there is no exception even for our allies.
  The United States regularly conditions military aid on compliance 
with U.S. law and international humanitarian law. In the case of 
Israel, I have long argued that the United States should use all of the 
tools at its disposal, including placing conditions on U.S. military 
assistance, to move the parties closer to permanent peace and a two-
state solution.
  Prime Minister Netanyahu's actions are not moving closer to a two-
state solution. Instead, his actions set conditions for endless 
violence.
  Since October 7, extremist settlers in the West Bank have 
deliberately hunted down and killed Palestinians and, according to the 
United Nations, displaced more than 1,000 people.
  In Gaza, Israeli forces have struck hospitals and refugee camps, 
killing scores of civilians in pursuit of its military targets.
  Israel has ordered Palestinians to evacuate for safety and then 
bombed the safe zones.
  The videos from Gaza of dead children and wailing parents are 
shattering. They document the current Israeli Government's continued 
moral and humanitarian failures.
  It now appears that Israel is prepared to impose in southern Gaza the 
same staggering level of civilian death that it carried out in the 
north. That is wrong.
  I lay these actions at the feet of Prime Minister Netanyahu. If the 
Prime Minister insists on conducting military operations with little 
regard for civilian life and in a manner that moves the region deeper 
into perpetual war, then he does not deserve America's blanket 
financial support.
  I understand the desire to help Israel and the people of Israel, but 
given the actions of the Prime Minister, Congress should condition any 
military funding on an agreement that civilian lives will be protected, 
that Palestinians will receive the humanitarian aid they need, and that 
international law will be fully respected.
  Over the past 2 months, I have had many conversations with people 
across Massachusetts about the path forward. This conflict is horrific, 
and it is deeply personal. I have talked to Israelis who have lost 
beloved friends and family. I have held parents who have had children 
violently taken as hostages. I have talked to Palestinians who have had 
family members killed. I have held hands with people conducting a 
desperate, long-distance search for missing loved ones. I have joined 
the sometimes-frantic efforts to help Palestinians who are desperately 
trying to get out of Gaza but can't. The pain runs deep for all of 
them.
  This conflict has also sparked a wave of hate here in the United 
States. The Council on American-Islamic Relations in Massachusetts has 
received a record number of calls reporting vandalism, violence, and 
retaliation against Palestinians. A man in Boston was arrested for 
attacking the Holocaust Memorial, and synagogues in Attleboro are 
receiving bomb threats.
  I have had Muslim and Palestinian constituents talk to me about being 
pulled over for extra screening at the airport while their White travel 
companions sailed right on through. I have heard stories of how hard it 
can be to land a small business loan or get a credit card application 
approved even when they meet all the criteria.
  Anti-Palestinian hate is endangering our neighbors. Three college 
students in Burlington were shot on their way to dinner. I have had 
moms tell me they are now afraid to say that they are Palestinian, and 
they are now afraid for their children to leave the house.
  Anti-Semitism is endangering our neighbors. Hillel leaders tell me 
they are afraid to walk alone on campus or speak up in classes. Mothers 
say they worry about bringing their toddlers to activities at their 
synagogue because it could be the target of an attack.
  In these moments, each of us has an obligation to speak out clearly 
and loudly against hate. Each of us has an obligation to actively 
oppose hate in all of its forms. Anti-Semitism must be rejected. 
Islamophobia and anti-Palestinianism must be cast off. We should make 
our intentions clear. We should work toward those goals until they are 
finally true. No one should be afraid. No one should feel unsafe. And 
it is on our shoulders to build an America where there is no place for 
hate.
  But there is more for us to do. We cannot give up on peace. Hamas 
leaders make their goals clear: perpetual war and death. But, as I said 
earlier, Hamas is not the Palestinian people, and the Palestinian 
people are not Hamas.

  In the midst of the chaos and pain of this terrible war, I hold fast 
to the possibility that people of good will, both Palestinians and 
Israelis, can build a lasting peace.
  I have long believed that a two-state solution is the best path, is 
the only path for Israel's long-term security and the only way to 
ensure that Palestinians have the rights, the freedom, and the self-
determination they need to build a secure future for themselves and 
their children.
  In the short term, the needed work is obvious: Resume the cease-fire, 
accelerate humanitarian aid, protect innocent civilians, and release 
the hostages. In the long term, the hard labor--the labor that ensures 
that we won't be here again and again and again to mourn the deaths of 
the people we love and have lost to an endless cycle of war--the hard 
labor is to drive toward a just and lasting peace for both Israelis and 
Palestinians.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.
  Mr. RICKETTS. Madam President, I am going to say something that I 
don't think ought to be controversial--that Hamas should receive no 
U.S. taxpayer dollars. But apparently some people think that is 
controversial.
  On October 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization dedicated to the 
destruction of Israel and to killing Jews, broke the cease-fire and 
attacked Israel.
  Now, this was not a military attack; these were terrorists who came 
across the border to kill civilians. They killed 1,200 Israelis and 33 
Americans.
  Last week, along with my Senate colleagues, I watched an uncensored 
video

[[Page S5789]]

taken from Hamas body cameras, cell phones, on surveillance television, 
intercepts of radio and telephone conversations. It was horrific. This 
atrocity was perpetrated by barbaric savages. We witnessed them shoot 
unarmed civilians. We saw the evidence of young girls raped. We saw the 
dead bodies of children, some burned beyond recognition. We watched as 
a Hamas terrorist decapitated an Israeli soldier. It was truly 
horrifying.
  Hamas started the war. They are responsible for every person who died 
on that day and every person who has died in Gaza since. They are a 
terrorist organization dedicated to destroying Israel. In fact, we 
heard some of the phone conversations from Hamas terrorists who called 
back their parents, bragging about how many Jews they had killed. It is 
absolutely horrific.
  We must stand with Israel until Hamas is destroyed utterly. Humanity 
will have been done a favor by the State of Israel when Hamas is 
destroyed. We also must examine the Biden policies that are supporting 
Hamas. I know--yes, I said that. It is crazy, but it is true. The Biden 
administration has already given $730 million and wants to add another 
$260 million to it.
  You see, there is this organization called the United Nations Relief 
and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, and it has 
long been documented that they have been infiltrated by Hamas.
  This organization, also known as UNRWA, has hired Hamas agents. Their 
teachers have been preaching about killing Jews. Their textbooks 
glorify martyrdom. They demonize Israelis and sow anti-Semitism. UNRWA 
schools have stored weapons facilities for Hamas. There is a U.N. 
report that shows UNRWA schools have launched attacks against Israel. 
On October 7, UNRWA employees applauded the attack, including 14 UNRWA 
teachers. Now we have a report that an UNRWA teacher held one of the 
hostages in that teacher's attic, barely feeding the hostage.
  This is an organization that has been described as essentially a 
branch of Hamas. The Trump administration knew this, and so they cut 
off funds, with President Trump saying the organization UNRWA was 
irredeemable. Inexplicably, the Biden administration resumed funding 
and wants to continue resumed funding.
  We must not let our tax dollars go to support Hamas, and that is why 
I have introduced the Stop Support for Hamas Act.
  This act would make sure no economic development dollars go to Gaza 
or to the West Bank until Israel verifies that Hamas has been 
dismantled. It would ensure that the Palestinian Authority is not 
hiring Hamas or their affiliates. It would strengthen the Taylor Force 
Act to make sure the Palestinian Authority does away with this horrific 
pay-to-slay policy, and it would ensure that any other NGO that is 
working would not hire Hamas or Hamas affiliates.
  What we saw on October 7 was inhumane; it was barbaric; it was 
horrifying; it was an atrocity--an atrocity committed by Hamas. We must 
stand with Israel until Hamas is utterly destroyed.
  We must ensure that no more funding from American taxpayers goes to 
Hamas through UNRWA as 118 of the terrorists who attacked Israel on 
October 7 were educated in UNRWA schools. These schools are part of the 
problem, and the Trump administration knew it. I ask all of my 
colleagues to support my bill that will end this terrible policy.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The senior Senator from 
Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that, following 
Senator Menendez, I be recognized for up to 20 minutes prior to the 
scheduled rollcall vote.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The senior Senator from New Jersey.
  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, as our allies and democracies around 
the world face compounding life-and-death geopolitical challenges, the 
world is watching what we do or fail to do here in the U.S. Senate, and 
the stakes could not be any higher.
  Ukraine is rapidly running out of arms to defend itself against 
Russia's illegal invasion and the many war crimes it has been 
perpetrating against the Ukrainian people. Israel is in the midst of an 
existential war against Hamas--a barbaric terrorist organization funded 
and propped up by Iran's brutal regime with one singular mission: to 
wipe out Israel and every Jew on the face of the Earth.
  Moreover, our allies in the Indo-Pacific, like Taiwan, remain on high 
alert as China aggressively flexes its military and economic might 
there and around the globe while, at the same time, taking careful 
notes on how democracies around the world respond when one nation 
violates the sovereignty of another by attempting to take its territory 
by force.
  Now is the time for the U.S. Senate to come together in defense of 
America's allies in their hour of need. We have a strategic security, 
economic, and moral imperative to meet the moment, and that is exactly 
what Democrats in the Senate are ready to do.
  Right now, Democrats are prepared to take up and pass the National 
Security and Border Act of 2024, a comprehensive package that provides 
aid to Israel, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, and Taiwan as well as 
addresses ongoing challenges at our southern border, including the flow 
of migration and fentanyl into the United States.
  Democrats are willing to put politics aside and defend our allies and 
our values with real dollars, real military aid, and real solutions. We 
are ready to secure our southern border against the most dire threats 
we face, especially the relentless flow of deadly fentanyl fueling our 
Nation's opioid epidemic.
  Now, to be crystal clear, some aspects of this supplemental package, 
which closely mirrors the supplemental request President Biden sent to 
Congress, raise serious concerns for me and for others.
  For example, I am worried about funding to add another 1,300 Border 
Patrol agents to work at the border. The U.S. Border Patrol is already 
the largest Federal law enforcement Agency, and its alarming track 
record of the abuse and mistreatment of migrants gives me pause about 
expanding its force further.
  I also have serious hesitations about funding to expand our detention 
capacity by over 45,000 beds. Detaining migrants en masse, including 
entire families, is never the most humane or effective solution to 
managing our border.
  Supporting a supplemental package that includes these items would not 
be an easy vote for me and several of my colleagues. It would be quite 
difficult because these funds come with concerning policy consequences. 
However, in the name of getting a reasonable, thoughtful package across 
the finish line for our allies in need, without gutting our asylum and 
humanitarian parole laws, I certainly am willing to consider it.
  But where are Republicans? Americans might ask. Where are our 
colleagues across the aisle who, for so many years, have posited 
themselves as the champions of defending democracy and freedom around 
the world? Where is the party of Reagan--the party of self-proclaimed 
defense hawks who supposedly never bat an eye when it comes to 
supporting our allies?
  In an incomprehensible turn of events, Republicans have decided they 
are going to hold hostage vital aid to our closest allies in a life-
and-death struggle over completely unrelated, hyperpartisan demands on 
immigration and border policy, and they are insisting on these changes 
without any actual, deliberative process or willingness to compromise.
  No, you didn't hear that incorrectly.
  Senate Republicans have declared they are ready to tank this national 
security package--one that would help our allies defend themselves so 
that we don't have to send America's sons and daughters into harm's way 
and take the battle themselves when the next set of NATO countries is 
invaded by countries like Russia. I would rather have the Ukrainians 
fight for their freedom and provide them the resources to do so instead 
of sending America's sons and daughters abroad.
  Now, why are they doing this? Because they are using the immigration 
issue, in my view, to hide behind the embarrassing fact that a 
significant number of Republicans in both Chambers doesn't want to vote 
for aid to Ukraine and because Democrats refuse

[[Page S5790]]

to accede to far-right and far-reaching immigration policy demands that 
have absolutely nothing to do with the existential crises threatening 
our allies.

  It is the height of irresponsibility and partisan politics for 
Republicans to claim that the price for assisting our international 
allies is to gut our asylum and humanitarian parole laws, which, I 
would add, as someone who has been on this issue for almost a quarter 
of a century, will do nothing to mitigate the flow of migration and 
deadly drugs into our country.
  Think about the dangerous signal that sends: The United States cannot 
temporarily put aside its domestic political disputes to confront the 
collective challenges facing democracies and freedom around the world. 
Such a signal would be crippling to those who look to the United States 
for our leadership when confronted with the evils of tyranny and 
terrorism. Such a signal would amount to a shameful retreat from 
America's singular place on the world stage and would leave us with 
fewer allies willing to stand with us. Who is going to stand with you 
if you are going to cut and run?
  What makes this all so much worse is that Republicans are willing to 
gamble our national security interests--indeed, our ability to conduct 
foreign policy--over half-baked, failed ideas that do nothing to solve 
the problems they claim to solve.
  Let's just take a look at a few of the demands the Republicans are 
making on immigration and asylum policies.
  I heard one of our colleagues speak before that we only just want to 
have the asylum crisis be dealt with quicker. Well, that is not the 
case. Republicans say, for example, that they want to heighten the 
initial ``credible fear'' standard asylum seekers must pass and have 
been passing for decades in order to make it to the next stage of the 
asylum process.
  Well, news flash: No matter how much the ``credible fear'' standard 
is heightened, it will do nothing to address the root problems causing 
asylum seekers to flee their home countries in the first place. If I am 
in one of these countries and my choice is to stay or die or see my 
daughter raped by a gang or be forcibly put into a gang, I am going to 
flee. That is why we have 20 million people in the Southern Hemisphere 
who are refugees and asylees displaced presently in other countries in 
the Western Hemisphere.
  Unless we deal with that root cause challenge and help those 
countries assimilate those people, those are 20 million feet that are 
going to come knocking. Worse yet, constricting access to asylum would 
only encourage more illegal attempts to make it into the United States 
through other avenues that will, ultimately, enrich human smuggling 
networks.
  Our asylum system encourages order. In fiscal year 2023, 99.5 percent 
of asylum seekers appeared--appeared--99.5 percent of asylum seekers 
appeared for their hearings before an immigration judge. So only about 
five-tenths of a percent were in absentia. The vast majority of those 
asylum claims was, ultimately, denied. Then, at that point, they no 
longer have a right to be present.
  Pushing migrants outside of the asylum system is not in the interest 
of anyone who wants an orderly immigration system or who professes to 
care about reducing the numbers of migrants that are encountered 
throughout the border.
  Republicans say, for example, they want to dramatically limit the 
President's statutory authority to grant individuals humanitarian 
parole into the United States in response to major crises such as wars 
and invasions.
  Well, here is another news flash: Dramatically shrinking humanitarian 
parole risks dramatically increasing irregular flows of migration to 
our borders.
  Think about what would have happened in the wake of America's 
withdrawal from Afghanistan or in the wake of Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine if the United States did not have a robust humanitarian parole 
system screening tens of thousands of Afghans and Ukrainians for refuge 
through an orderly process. It would have been utter chaos with unknown 
numbers of unscreened, unvetted individuals from these countries 
potentially seeking entry at our borders.
  Humanitarian parole allows the United States to be in the driver's 
view to determine which individuals can obtain protection in the United 
States and which cannot.
  It also serves our national security interests by sending a clear 
message: If you stand with us, if you fight for freedom and there comes 
a life-and-death moment, we will provide you with refuge.
  So this shouldn't be about sticking it to President Biden and the 
Democrats. The reality is that there will one day be another Democratic 
or Republican administration that will need to rely on our humanitarian 
parole laws to respond to moments of crisis like in Afghanistan and 
Ukraine. By fundamentally eroding these laws, Republicans would only 
hamper the ability of any future administration to respond to such 
crises. Gutting humanitarian parole only invites the very chaos at our 
borders that Republicans claim they want to mitigate.
  What these and other demands reflect is the now-dominant and 
dangerous strain of Republican thinking that believes that our asylum, 
humanitarian parole, and refugee systems are largely fraudulent, 
allowing undeserving individuals to enter into our country.
  Years of anti-immigrant fearmongering by former President Trump 
appear to have clouded the Republicans' ability to talk about our 
immigration system based on the facts--the type of conversations we had 
when we passed comprehensive immigration reform in this Chamber with a 
gang of Senators--Republicans and Democrats--of which I was a part, 
with an overwhelming vote. That was a level-headed discussion. As a 
result, their policy ideas now are driven more by Stephen Miller's 
demagoguery than by any deliberative assessment of reality.
  Here are some facts worth reminding my Republican friends about: 
Immigrants wield nearly $1.3 trillion--trillion--in spending power in 
the United States, and they contribute tens of billions of dollars in 
taxes every year. A recent study found that a 25-percent reduction in 
the number of asylum seekers in the United States would cause an 
economic loss of over $20 billion over 5 years.
  Immigrants disproportionately make up our essential workforce by 
taking care of our sick, putting food on our tables, and taking care of 
our workplaces. They were the ones, when we were all home, sheltering, 
who were out taking the risks of their lives in order that the rest of 
us could be sheltered.
  Immigrants are 80 percent more likely to become entrepreneurs than 
native-born Americans. Indeed, nearly 45 percent of Fortune 500 
companies--45 percent of Fortune 500 companies--which employ tens of 
millions of Americans, were founded by immigrants or their children.
  These migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees have not just enriched 
our economy, they have changed and shaped our Nation and the world more 
broadly.
  Ever hear of Albert Einstein, a refugee who changed our understanding 
of science forever; Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google, a refugee who 
changed technology forever; Gloria Estefan, a refugee who fled the 
Cuban revolution with her family and helped shaped our musical 
landscape; or how about former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright--does that name ring a bell?--a refugee from Czechoslovakia 
who helped shaped the modern world as the first woman to ever serve as 
U.S. Secretary of State. The list goes on and on and on.
  The hard, undeniable reality is this: Our Nation's prosperity, power, 
and greatness are inextricably intertwined with our identity as a 
nation of striving, hard-working immigrants. So it is no wonder that 
our asylum, refugee, and humanitarian parole systems have received 
overwhelming bipartisan support over the decades. They are an essential 
source of our strength.
  And let's be perfectly clear about something else. Welcoming asylum 
seekers, parolees, and refugees into the country is far from just an 
act of compassion. These systems directly support our national security 
and strategic economic interest at home and abroad.
  Imagine a world where the United States and other countries did not 
have systems to provide refuge to dissidents,

[[Page S5791]]

journalists, lawyers, and others taking on tyrants and defending 
liberties in their countries. Would they have the same level of courage 
to enact change in their countries if they did not think they could 
protect themselves and their families if they faced life-and-death 
persecution?
  So to my Republican friends, I say this: It is time to free 
yourselves from the Trumpian demagoguery that informs your current 
worldview on immigration. Join us in good faith to deliver inclusive, 
humane, and orderly immigration reform that will secure our borders, 
provide relief to the undocumented community, and strengthen our 
strategic posture in the world.
  However, attempting to force this conversation here and now, when our 
allies have their backs against the wall, when they are fighting on the 
frontlines to protect U.S. interests, and when innocent people's lives 
hang in the balance is the height of recklessness and irresponsibility.
  We can continue serving as the world's last, best defender of freedom 
and democracy without sacrificing one of our greatest strengths: our 
identity as a nation of immigrants.
  We are the United States of America. Let's start acting like it.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we have a lot of work to get done 
before January 19, the next deadline to pass our funding and avoid a 
shutdown.
  The American people are looking for serious leadership and results, 
and I come to the floor today to be clear about what the standard for 
success is here.
  We need to pass regular, full-year funding, based on the bipartisan 
spending agreement from earlier this year, that actually responds to 
the challenges before us. Anything less means missing critical 
opportunities and worse.
  A ``date-change, full-year CR,'' as proposed by House Speaker 
Johnson, would be unprecedented and reckless.
  Why is that? Well, because the Speaker's proposal would lock in 
outdated spending plans and devastating across-the-board cuts while 
locking all of us out of any kind of thoughtful decision-making process 
for our Nation's future, all of which should be absolutely unacceptable 
to everyone here.
  It is one thing to have a short-term CR so we have additional time to 
negotiate in good faith and finish passing bills, full-year bills that 
strengthen our Nation, but it is another thing entirely to do a 
yearlong CR because we have no intention of doing our job.
  We cannot just throw up our hands, act like nothing in the world has 
changed in the past 12 months, abdicate our responsibility to our 
constituents, and box in our Nation's future by putting the government 
on autopilot.
  When you put the government on autopilot, without direction or any 
consideration of changing needs, you are functionally causing year-
over-year funding cuts without any rhyme, reason, or recalibration for 
new and changing priorities, causing huge uncertainties and 
inefficiencies across our Federal Government and seriously impairing 
every single one of our Agencies' ability to fulfill their mission and 
move our country forward. And that, by the way, is all before taking 
into account the incredibly steep across-the-board cuts that would come 
into play under this scenario under our Fiscal Responsibility Act.
  This runs way deeper than numbers, at best, stagnating on a page and 
Agencies cutting hard-working staff and crucial services. We are 
talking about missing opportunities on issues where the clock is 
ticking, pulling the rug out from our families who are struggling, and 
undermining our national defense and security in front of the whole 
world.
  I think we all understand now is a dangerous time to signal America's 
global leadership is faltering, but that is exactly the message a 
yearlong CR would send: a year of America's military falling behind and 
a year of our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts falling behind.
  When we put our government on autopilot, we are telling the world 
Congress is asleep at the wheel and incapable of responding to the 
growing threats of an ever more dangerous world.

  In practical terms for defense, as my colleague--the senior Senator 
from Maine and vice chair of the committee--said here on this floor 
recently, it means the Pentagon freezing 330 new programs or production 
increases. It means falling behind in building our ships and our subs 
and much more and doing so, by the way, at a time when China already 
has a larger navy.
  It means essentially no new progress in our efforts to strengthen our 
military and diplomatic footprint in the Indo-Pacific so we can forge 
strong partnerships and deter aggression from the Chinese Government. 
This is something we devoted significant thought and resources to 
across our bipartisan spending bills, with new funding for our Indo-
Pacific strategy and the Countering PRC Influence Fund, not to mention 
other global leadership investments like the new Economic Resilience 
Initiative that will help strengthen our supply chains for critical 
resources and weaken the financial pressure our competitors can exert 
on key U.S. partners.
  But all that goes out the window with a full-year CR, particularly 
under the construct that has been proposed by the Speaker of the House, 
where he would simply change a date and quit--change a date and quit.
  Can you imagine a leader, one of the highest ranking officials in 
this country, if not the world, seriously proposing that as an answer 
right now?
  Under the yearlong CR, we would not have critical funding increases 
to support our servicemembers, to support their families, from troop 
readiness essentials like recruitment and training to family support 
like childcare and barracks, to other projects like the Shipyard 
Infrastructure Optimization Plan.
  I also want to remind our colleagues, a full-year CR would not just 
hurt our national security, it would be devastating for our families 
and our communities across the country and our country's future.
  When it comes to keeping our economy strong, there are simply too 
many missed opportunities to even list.
  We would lose out increases in bolstering trade and U.S. business 
competitiveness. We would lose out on strengthening our supply chain 
and building innovation hubs. We would lose out on research funding for 
manufacturing; AI; agriculture; clean energy; cures and treatments for 
cancer, Alzheimer's, and other terrible diseases and a lot more.
  We would lose ground in our plans to send Americans back to the Moon, 
while the Chinese Government is going full speed ahead.
  And when it comes to fighting the opioid epidemic, resigning our 
Nation to a yearlong CR means the increased investments that we did 
include in our Senate bills to keep fentanyl out of our country by 
stopping drug cartels and getting help to patients and families won't 
happen.
  Instead, stagnant funding means furloughs at our border and thousands 
of pounds of illicit drugs reaching our communities.
  A CR also will not include any funding to reform cosmetics safety or 
retirement security or the organ donation and transplant system.
  And let's talk about WIC. WIC is the lifeline for moms who need 
formula, nutritious food, and other essentials to feed their babies. It 
is at risk of being severely underfunded by a CR.
  I grew up in a family who knew what it meant to fall on hard times 
and have a government that had our backs. I will not let our country 
pull out the rug from folks in their time of need. But if we put 
spending on autopilot for the next year, we will be kicking struggling 
families off benefits and onto wait-lists.
  It is not just WIC that is going to see these painful shortfalls that 
will ultimately hurt families, it is programs that keep families warm 
in the winter or cool in the summer and safe from extreme temperatures 
like LIHEAP. It is programs that give people healthcare, like community 
health centers and the new suicide prevention lifeline. It is programs 
that make sure families have a roof over their head, rental assistance, 
affordable housing, homelessness prevention--programs that already 
can't meet the needs in their communities.
  It is the Social Security Administration, for crying out loud. A CR 
would

[[Page S5792]]

force them to reduce hours and lay off staff. You want to call up and 
sign up for new benefits or see how you can fix a problem? There will 
be no one to answer you--long wait times.
  And let's not forget, it is programs for folks who are trying to 
improve their situation, get a better job, and further their own 
career. A CR means no increases for apprenticeship funding, workforce 
training, or the maximum Pell amount.
  What else do parents need if they are going to go to work? I have 
said it many times, childcare. We are in a childcare crisis, and with a 
full-year CR, this is only going to go from bad to worse because we 
will be resigned to across-the-board cuts to our Nation's childcare 
programs.
  And our public schools also will face tight budgets. Kids are still 
recovering from this pandemic, and we can't afford to provide our 
schools less funding when our students deserve and need more support. 
It is that simple.
  Look, I have been going on for a while. But the truth is, I have 
barely scratched the surface on what we will lose with a full-year CR: 
Increases throughout our bills to support Tribal communities, gone; 
over a billion dollars for FAA modernization efforts, gone; housing for 
wildland firefighters, improvements in our rail system, next-generation 
weather satellites, gone, gone, and gone.
  And here is the kicker: I have only been talking so far about half 
the equation because the Fiscal Responsibility Act would force 
absolutely devastating across-the-board cuts on virtually all domestic 
programs that could be as much as nearly 10 percent.
  Let's be clear about the damage here. Immediate hiring freezes and 
furloughs at just about every Agency. Millions of women and kids would 
lose WIC benefits; wait times at ports of entry would quadruple; wait 
times for new business permits from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and 
Trade Bureau would increase fivefold; nearly 1,000 fewer full-time food 
safety inspectors; 2,500 fewer national park employees and less staff 
and equipment for our Federal firefighters; 5,000 scientists, students, 
and technical staff no longer receiving research support at our 
national labs and universities; 130,000 fewer small businesses getting 
training and counseling from the Small Business Association; nearly 
700,000 households losing Federal housing assistance and being pushed 
toward homelessness; 2\1/2\ million patients across Indian Country hurt 
by a $235 million cut to the Indian Health Service hospitals and 
clinics.
  And that is the tip of the iceberg. We are talking tens of billions 
of dollars slashed to programs that keep our country competitive and 
our economy strong and our families safe and sound. So this is really 
no run-of-the-mill CR outcome, which would be bad enough as it is.
  The bottom line here is this: We have a job to do. We have a job to 
do. Our constituents expect us to come to work, to listen to them, 
respond to the challenges in their life, write the bills, solve our 
problems, and deliver results. At a minimum, they expect us to try--not 
threaten, as the Speaker is doing, to change a few words and give up.
  A long-term CR wouldn't just shut out their voices, it would cede 
ground to our adversaries, let America fall behind, and cut off vital 
resources families count on each and every day.
  If we want to make sure that America continues to lead; if we want a 
strong, competitive economy; if we want a safer world; and if we want a 
real future for our families, we cannot just throw our hands up and 
hope for the best. We have to come together, do the hard work of 
governing, hammer out bipartisan spending bills that actually reflect 
what we think our Nation needs, get back to the bipartisan spending 
agreement that the House Republicans wanted--actually, getting back to 
that, they demanded it--and agree that extreme partisan riders have no 
place in our spending bills.
  In the full Senate here, as the Presiding Officer knows, we wrote 12 
bipartisan spending bills that follow the full terms of the bipartisan 
spending agreement, but now we need House Republicans to hold up their 
end of the bargain. That means sticking to the entire agreement and 
using the full resources it provides for defense and domestic programs.
  We cannot move forward if House Republicans are busy trying to go 
back on their word, especially for a deal that they pushed for and 
negotiated in the first place. Let's all remember that House 
Republicans were the ones who chose to hold the debt limit hostage 
until they secured this agreement. Let's also remember it was their 
leader who negotiated this deal directly with the President. They cut 
this deal. When you negotiate a deal, you don't then bargain over how 
much of your word you are going to keep. Deals are built on common 
ground and mutual trust, not shifting sand.
  So, Madam President, I will be clear. I am not calling on Republicans 
to do anything extreme here or anything I wouldn't do myself. I get 
that no one ever gets everything they want, especially in a divided 
government. In fact, as I have said many times, I believe the cuts that 
were enacted by the Fiscal Responsibility Act set us back. But that was 
the deal. That was the deal we voted on. So, here in the Senate, we did 
write 12 bipartisan bills to those terms. That is the job. That is what 
legislating looks like in a divided government.
  If we are going to avoid an unnecessary shutdown or an absolutely 
unacceptable, inflexible, yearlong CR--for the first time ever--we need 
everyone to get real about just what is at stake if we give up on 
writing serious, full-year funding bills. And that is just what it is 
going to take to get that done. So I call on everybody: Let's do our 
job.

Madam President, twice before, Republicans have come to 
this floor to attempt to pass by unanimous consent the House-passed 
stand-alone aid package to Israel that would provide our ally with $14 
billion in military assistance for their fight to destroy the Hamas 
terrorists and send a loud message to Iran and its proxies.
  I would like to yield the floor to the Senator from Florida.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.
  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator 
from Kansas for his continued effort to make sure we get Israel aid.
  The United States must always stand with our great ally Israel and 
with the Jewish people. Israel is fighting against Iran-backed 
terrorists for its very existence.
  Iran-backed Hamas terrorists have murdered thousands with the 
intention of destroying Israel and the Jewish people. Hamas terrorists 
have beheaded babies, burned them alive, raped and murdered young 
women.
  We have seen the news reports of the sexual assaults committed by 
Hamas terrorists--all too graphic to speak of here, but here are some 
of the headlines.
  ABC News: ``New signs emerge of `widespread' sexual crimes by Hamas, 
as Netanyahu alleges global indifference.''
  The Washington Post: ``Israel investigates an elusive, horrific 
enemy: Rape as a weapon of war.''
  The Jewish Chronicle: ``Hamas terror attack: Girls `raped next to 
their dead friends' at rave massacre.''
  We cannot turn a blind eye to these barbaric acts. The world must 
know what these animals did to innocent Jewish women and girls.
  Just yesterday in the U.S. House of Representatives, the presidents 
of Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania were asked, under 
oath, if calling for the genocide of Jews violates their university's 
code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment.
  A simple yes-or-no question. Their response? They could not even 
answer yes.
  We have to really let that sink in. They couldn't say yes. The 
president of three Ivy League schools could not answer yes to that 
simple question.
  It is clear that we need to use this moment to stand with Israel and 
the Jewish people.
  The House took decisive action by passing this bill. They moved 
quickly, and the measure is fully paid for. This bill was blocked by 
the Democrats

[[Page S5795]]

once, but today the Senate can change that error and pass this bill 
right now. And I am proud to colead the companion bill in the Senate 
with the Senator from Kansas.
  I yield the floor.
  Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I would like to yield the floor to the 
senior Senator from Tennessee.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.
  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to be 
on the floor this afternoon with my colleague from Kansas.
  It is 2 months ago tomorrow that Hamas carried out these horrific 
attacks in Israel. Now, bear in mind that the Jewish State--and this is 
the world's only Jewish State--is in a fight for their very survival 
because Hamas has decided that they are going to continue this. They 
said October 7 was basically the beginning. And they continued to do 
this over and over and over.
  Now, this is why we have said let's deal with the aid to Israel and 
do it separately from Ukraine and from Taiwan. And let's also talk 
about our border. So there is a reason for what we are doing.
  Now, I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not 
want to have a pay-for. House Republicans have chosen to have the pay-
for. And yes, indeed, this Chamber needs to be working with the House 
to fund a resolution to this issue. And I appreciate that my colleague 
from Washington brought up the fact that we need to work through this 
issue. Indeed, we do. So let's work through these issues separately.

  When it comes to Israel aid, there are some urgent needs that are 
there. There is $4 billion to replenish the Iron Dome. This is a 
wonderful technology that we have worked with Israel in creating. It is 
incredibly effective. They need $4 billion for replenishment.
  Bear in mind--I said Hamas has told us--they did it once; they are 
going to do this again.
  They need $1 billion for munitions. They need $50 million for help to 
evacuate Americans, $150 million to help secure our Embassy in 
Jerusalem.
  And using the money that was set aside for additional IRS agents but 
has not been used--that makes sense to Tennesseans, that we would do 
that.
  I tell you where Tennesseans do have a problem. They look at our 
national debt, $34 trillion. That is about $100,000 for every man, 
woman, and child.
  I have a grandbaby who will be 4 months old tomorrow--his debt share, 
$100,000.
  Think about what we are doing. Think about what effect this will have 
18, 19, 20 years from now, when that child draws their first paycheck, 
and how it is going to limit their opportunity.
  Another thing that doesn't seem to make sense, while we all agree 
that Israel needs to receive their funding, Tennesseans don't want this 
to come attached with billions of dollars for other programs, like $10 
billion for global humanitarian assistance and more than $2 billion for 
assistance to resettle refugees.
  This is something that separately needs our attention. If we want to 
talk about securing borders, let's secure our border first. When we 
talk about aid to Israel, let's do it, and let's pay for it.
  I appreciate my colleague from Kansas.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.
  Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I would like to yield some time to the 
senior Senator from Alabama.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.
  Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam President, I join my colleagues to support our 
ally Israel.
  On October 7, Israel was suddenly and deliberately attacked by Hamas 
terrorists. The terrorists targeted innocent people, not military 
targets. That is very important. They killed thousands of civilians, 
including dozens of Americans. They filmed their own atrocities and put 
videos on the internet. They were very proud of what they were doing. 
It is absolutely disgraceful.
  The United States has supported Israel from the very beginning. The 
first leader in the world to recognize Israel was Harry Truman. 
Administrations from both parties have strongly supported Israel, but 
now the Biden administration is trying to ride the fence.
  Joe Biden knows that his voting base does not like it. The left 
dislikes Israel. In their woke ideology, they say Palestinians are 
oppressed by Israel. It is just not true.
  Since the war broke out in October, liberals in Congress and around 
the country have expressed sympathy for Hamas. It has been especially 
bad on college campuses. I am not even going to repeat some of the 
things that have been said by Democrat Members of Congress.
  Joe Biden has also continued to practice appeasement of Iran. When 
Joe Biden took office, Iran was dead broke. They had access to just a 
few billion dollars in foreign currencies. Today, they have 10 times 
that much money. This is because of loosened sanctions and because of 
oil sales by Iran.
  Iran is the No. 1 sponsor of terrorism in the world. Iran provides 
funding for Hamas and for Hezbollah. Joe Biden is helping Iran to get 
rich. There is no question that sanctions relief for Iran will end up 
in the hands of terrorists. Joe Biden wants to ride the fence, but we 
can't ride the fence on this one, not for our ally.
  This is a battle between good and evil. This is about an ally of the 
United States of America fighting terrorists who killed innocent women 
and children. And let's remember, the terrorists killed Americans too. 
Hamas would love to kill more Americans, and they will kill more 
Americans if they get the chance. So Israel needs to wage a war of 
extermination against Hamas.
  I am supporting this legislation to provide $14 billion in aid to 
Israel. Unlike the Democrats' request for foreign aid, this is paid 
for. We pay for it by cancelling out the Democrats' plan to supersize 
the IRS.
  Are they more important than Israel?
  Last year, the Democrats cut the IRS a check for $80 billion. Their 
plan is to hire 80,000 new IRS agents. They want to double the size of 
the IRS. They want to shake down the American people for every last 
dime.
  The wealthy will be just fine. The wealthy have tax lawyers and 
accountants. It is families and small businesses that will pay this 
price. A report from the Joint Tax Committee said that the Democrats' 
bill last year raised taxes on almost every tax bracket.
  So, last month, every Senator went on record on this bill to support 
Israel. Every Republican voted for it. Every Democrat voted against it.
  Now, it is clear for all the American people to see who supports 
Israel. It is pretty simple. Who has other priorities? If the Democrats 
block this bill today, they are just doubling down.
  Democrats care a lot more about the IRS--bureaucrats shaking down 
small businesses--than they do about supporting our ally Israel in 
their fight against terrorism. It is time for Democrats to stop riding 
the fence. Stop trying to play both sides, and let's support our ally, 
Israel and ensure that the terrorists are defeated.
  I yield back to my colleague.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.
  Mr. MARSHALL. Next, I would like to yield the floor to my good 
friend, a staunch supporter of the people of Israel, the senior Senator 
from Texas.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.
  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am here on the floor to join my 
colleagues in support of Israel, and we are willing to do more than 
just speak those words. We are willing to do something about it--
something that, miraculously, the majority leader has been unwilling to 
do since November 2, when the House passed a $14.3 billion bill to 
provide aid to Israel.
  And, for some reason, the only person who has the authority to bring 
a bill like that to the floor to vote has refused to do so. It makes me 
wonder why. Why in the world would the majority leader, who I know 
supports Israel, refuse to bring a bill to the floor to provide that 
aid? So far, it is almost 5 weeks since the House passed an 
appropriations bill to do exactly that.
  Well, it could be that he doesn't like the pay-for, that he doesn't 
want us to quit adding to our national debt. But if that is the case, 
he could suggest another offset or pay-for. He could have tried to 
bring the bill to the floor and eliminate the pay-for that the House 
provided.

[[Page S5796]]

  Frankly, I think it makes plenty of sense to keep the House pay-for 
in the bill so we don't add to our national debt, which is now about 
100 percent of our economy. This last year alone, the United States 
Government paid over $600 billion in interest to our bondholders who 
own our national debt. And, apparently, the majority leader and our 
Democratic colleagues want to add to that and not stop this march 
toward bankruptcy or insolvency.
  So here we had a vote. The majority leader brings a bill to the floor 
to deal with Israel, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, and to provide more 
money to pay for the current broken border policies by the Biden 
administration.
  You might wonder: Why would he bring that bill to the floor with 
those four pieces, those four components, but yet refuse to bring a 
bill to the floor to fund Israel?
  You would think, well, at least it is a step in the direction he 
apparently wants to go. But the truth is that he is holding this Israel 
aid hostage to his desire to pass this other $106 billion 
appropriations bill, this supplemental.
  Now, don't get me wrong. Many of us support aid to Ukraine, but we 
also are going to insist on policy solutions to help prevent and stop 
and reverse what we see happening at our border, which is historically 
catastrophic.
  So this is really a very strange way of doing business. Here we are, 
almost 5 weeks after the House passed an Israel aid bill. You would 
think, well, the majority leader would say: Let's pass that and send it 
to the President, and then we can focus on the rest of the bill that 
was on the floor this afternoon--Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, and the 
border. But, apparently, he wants to use the support for the Israel aid 
to build the vote for the larger bill, understanding that, while 
support for Israel is virtually universal among both parties and in 
both Houses, there are some divisions on the Ukraine aid or the terms 
under which that aid is provided.
  So it is clear to me that he is holding up aid for Israel in order to 
achieve other objectives. That is his prerogative as majority leader, 
but I have to ask to our pro-Israel supporters around the country 
whether they think this is a legitimate leverage that could be used in 
order to achieve a larger objective, or whether it would make more 
sense, if you truly are a supporter of Israel, to go ahead and get this 
to the President and to get that aid to Israel and then come back and 
do the rest of what I know the majority leader wants to do.
  So the other part of this--which is amazing to me--is we know the 
Speaker passed the Israel aid because he knows he has concerns, and he 
doesn't know if he has the votes in the House to pass the larger 
package. So why would you not take up and pass the Israel aid as 
opposed to send the House this larger $106 billion package when it is 
unlikely that the Speaker is going to be able to pass that, at least 
based on his experience. Doesn't that also delay aid to Israel even 
more by packaging it with other items?
  Frankly, it is mysterious to me why all this time--2 months after 
Israel was attacked by Hamas, 5 weeks after the House has passed an 
Israel aid bill--that, finally, here we are coming to the floor, 
offering to take up and pass the Israel aid, and we are going to get an 
objection from the Democratic side.
  It is really mysterious to me. It is very puzzling. Why in the world 
would our Democratic colleagues, if they truly support Israel, if they 
truly want to fight--give Israel the tools they need to fight Hamas, a 
terrorist organization, bought and paid for by Tehran--why in the world 
would they object to it?
  Well, Washington, DC, in many ways, is a parallel universe that is 
very much unlike any of the rest of the country. What makes sense here, 
inside the beltway, makes no sense to our constituents back home, and 
this is just another example of that.
  So I applaud my colleague from Kansas for taking the initiative here 
and calling us together, and not just saying we support Israel but 
actually being willing to do something about it.
  That is another phenomenon here in Washington, DC. There are a lot of 
people who say the right words, but, when it comes to actions, they are 
missing in action.
  So I thank my colleague from Kansas.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.
  Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I sure appreciate the Senator from 
Texas speaking up and the wise words he shared. It reminds me of an old 
saying, that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, that funding 
Israel today is worth two of these other issues that seemingly just 
never can come together as we try to solve this four-headed riddle.
  As I said earlier, this is now my third time to the floor to try to 
pass with unanimous consent the House-passed, stand-alone aid package 
to Israel that would provide our ally with $14 billion in military 
assistance.
  Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stood on the Senate 
floor and debated with us and lectured us on why this bipartisan, 
House-passed legislation that maintains the exact spending levels 
requested by President Biden is somehow unreasonable. But I would like 
to share with you what I think is unreasonable. I think it is the 
Democrats' unwillingness to help our ally and separate this package to 
get it to the President's desk today. Unreasonable is my colleagues 
across the aisle using the crisis in Israel to secure more money for 
Ukraine. But what is unfathomable is what this body just admitted--that 
we are nowhere closer to getting this aid package passed than we were 
on October 7 when the war broke out.
  In case nobody is paying attention, tomorrow will be 2 months to the 
day that Hamas brutally and savagely attacked the people of Israel.
  I think we need to be honest with the American people. Negotiations 
aren't just stalled; they never started. Meaningful negotiations never 
started. We have a better chance of finding an ocean in Kansas than 
this $106 billion package seeing the light of day.
  Today, every single Republican sent a unanimous message to the 
Democrat leadership and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: We will not be 
bullied into voting on massive spending packages that use Israel as 
leverage to fund Democrat priorities, and we will not vote for any 
legislation that secures foreign nations' borders but not our own.
  So here we are once again offering an olive branch to separate this 
package out and address each of these issues one at a time. The House 
made this easy for us. They passed a bipartisan bill that would grant 
aid to Israel and allow us to break this logjam and focus on the more 
pressing matter to our national security: the border. The border. The 
border. The border.
  Now, the Democrats showed their hands 2 weeks ago when they voted 
unanimously against our bipartisan, stand-alone Israel aid bill that 
would have fast-tracked this package straight to the President's desk 
before Thanksgiving. But, sadly, this city loves to make the perfect 
the enemy of the good.
  The sensible thing for this body to do now is pass this bipartisan, 
stand-alone aid bill for Israel. This legislation passed the House over 
a month ago and could be delivered to President Biden's desk tonight. 
We should pass aid to Israel and then continue debating a potential 
broader package.
  Now, I have never heard of an American asking for more IRS agents. 
And if you are concerned about the pay-fors we presented, as I said 
time and time again, show us another pay-for.
  It is time to end the political talking points that we have heard on 
this floor.
  And please don't insult our intelligence. Don't insult the 
intelligence of Americans with the fake border security that is in this 
bigger, broader package that will only accelerate asylum, leading to 
more people crossing our border illegally.
  If you plan to object to this stand-alone bill's passage on the 
ground that military aid to Israel should include conditions, I want to 
note for the record that senior officials from the White House have 
said they are not pursuing such conditions.
  So, indeed, let's come together. Let's all come to the table. We 
tried it your way, and it failed. This is a huge opportunity to secure 
a bipartisan win and get to work on the most immediate threat to our 
national security--our wide-open southern border.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of H.R. 6126, which was received from the 
House. I further ask that the bill be considered

[[Page S5797]]

read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the table.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ossoff). Is there objection?
  The Senator from Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have 
been clear about why we must deliver support for Ukraine, Israel, and 
humanitarian assistance together, as have many of my colleagues. That 
is actually why we just attempted to move forward on one package that 
meets all of these needs--a package that Republicans blocked.
  I spoke about this before the vote, but let me just reiterate how 
dire the situation is right now.
  Our support for Ukraine has been essential, but it has also now been 
exhausted. Our allies are waiting for aid, and Putin is just waiting 
for us to send a sign that it is not coming. But Putin is not the only 
one watching right now. The world is watching this debate. Our allies 
want to know, when they are facing a crisis, can they count on America 
to stand with them or will we give up on them when it gets tough or 
when we get distracted with other crises? They are all watching and 
wondering, can America still lead or are we overwhelmed? Will America 
pick and choose which promises it keeps?
  Let's not forget, it is not just big-name allies and adversaries we 
are talking about here; there are many smaller but no less important 
countries that are watching. Some are in critical regions, facing 
historic decisions about the paths and partnerships they will pursue in 
the years ahead, and they are wondering, is the United States a 
reliable partner? We have to put those concerns to rest with a strong 
package that shows that our commitment to our allies and to standing up 
to dictators is ironclad.
  That is what is at stake here--not just our allies in Ukraine, who 
are at a key moment in their battle to protect their sovereignty, not 
just our deterrence to adversaries like Putin and other dictators who 
would trample democracy if given the chance, but our very credibility 
on the world stage.
  We have to respond to all these crises or we are telling the world: 
Don't count on America. We are at capacity.
  That is an incredibly dangerous message to send, especially at such a 
critical moment. It should be unthinkable.
  I appreciate my colleague's urgency to get aid to Israel, but this is 
a deeply flawed way to deliver it. This bill would not provide a single 
dollar in desperately needed humanitarian assistance to civilians in 
Gaza and elsewhere, and it would not address the urgent need to extend 
funding for Ukraine.
  There are civilians in Ukraine right now who are suffering and have 
been for months. There is also an enemy in Ukraine who is on the march 
and is just waiting for an opening to gain the upper hand.
  We have been discussing the aid for our allies in Ukraine for much 
longer than aid for Israel, which is also urgently needed, and we have 
already been delayed here for too long. To force Ukraine to wait or to 
withhold future aid is to abandon an ally, surrender to a dictator, and 
invite more chaos around the world.
  We cannot leave Ukraine behind, nor can we fail to deliver 
humanitarian assistance before the humanitarian crisis in Gaza devolves 
further into hopelessness that can worsen the threats we are already 
facing.
  At this critical moment, it is not just the right thing to do, it is 
essential to our national security interests to help promote stability 
and security. That same logic applies to other investments as well, 
like supporting our allies in the Indo-Pacific. Invest in stability so 
we avoid paying for chaos.

  We have to move quickly to respond to these challenges, yes, but we 
also have to move completely to respond to them because, as I have said 
before, they are all connected.
  If we let the Israel-Hamas war weaken our resolve elsewhere, we are 
telling dictators across the world: The best way to get America off 
your back is for it to be distracted by a crisis somewhere else.
  We are essentially giving Hamas and other extremists a new sales 
pitch to make when seeking support from bad actors: Give us support, 
and we will keep America busy. They can't deal with you if they are 
focused on us.
  That is a profoundly dangerous message to send.
  Putin is watching closely to see if this is his opportunity to make 
our resolve waiver in Ukraine. As it plots its next move, the Chinese 
Government is watching closely to see if we will stand up to 
aggressors. If we falter, other adversaries will take note as well. 
That is why doing half the job here is just not going to cut it. We 
have to do the whole job. Anything less is telling our allies that 
America cannot be trusted and telling dictators that they have free 
rein because America is too busy to lead right now.
  We must not invite chaos. We must not abandon any of our allies. We 
have to show that U.S. leadership is strong and capable of meeting all 
the challenges before us.
  So I urge Republicans to get serious about the situation before us so 
we can pass a package like the one we just voted on that shows the 
world that America takes its commitments seriously and doesn't just 
stand by some of its allies some of the time.
  With that, I yield to Senator Reed.
  Mr. REED. Thank you, Senator Murray.
  Mr. President?
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator reserve the right to object?
  Mr. REED. I would like to be recognized and reserve the right to 
object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.
  Mr. REED. Mr. President, just a few minutes ago, my Republican 
colleagues voted down the National Security and Border Act. In doing 
so, they essentially said no to supporting Israel, no to supporting 
Ukraine, no to supporting Taiwan, no to humanitarian assistance, which 
is absolutely critical, no to rebuilding our defense industrial base, 
no to border security funding, and no to combating fentanyl.
  These items are not the partisan demands of any one party; they are 
bipartisan priorities and necessities. They are the fulfillment of our 
commitments to our allies and to our national security.
  I believe the majority of our Republican colleagues do believe this, 
but some may see this as leverage--as one of my colleagues put it in a 
discussion, leverage for extreme immigration legislation that they 
don't at the moment have the votes to pass.
  In delaying the much needed assistance that I indicated, my 
Republican colleagues are indirectly, directly, or however you want to 
put it, giving too many opportunities or at least ideas to people like 
Putin and Chinese communists and others who are engaged in trying to 
undermine democracy throughout the world.
  Speaking for myself, I hope that what we can do is begin a serious 
debate now--not on the one issue that I listed but on all those 
issues--and come to a serious, principled compromise so that we can 
move forward together.
  It seems that my colleagues on the other side simply want us to 
accept their version of immigration reform, and then everything else 
will be OK. It is not that at all. In fact, one of the aspects of the 
legislation that was just voted down was a significant infusion of 
resources into the border area--1,300 additional Border Patrol agents, 
1,000 law enforcement personnel and investigative capabilities to 
prevent cartels from moving fentanyl into the country, 1,600 additional 
asylum officers, funding to conduct robust child labor investigations 
and enforcement to protect vulnerable migrant children entering the 
United States through the southern border, and the bipartisan FEND Off 
Fentanyl Act, led by our colleague, Senator Tim Scott of South 
Carolina.
  My colleagues just voted against a series of important ways to fix 
our problems at the border. We need them desperately, and we could have 
gotten them if we had moved forward procedurally.
  I have been here for a couple of years, and I have seen several 
occasions where we have been together on a bipartisan basis. I know in 
2013, led by Senator McCain and others, we passed comprehensive 
immigration reform, only to see it set aside by the Republican House of 
Representatives at the time.
  So we, I think, have to do much more, and we can, but it will be on a 
bipartisan, cooperative basis. We have to do much more to help not just 
Israel--

[[Page S5798]]

it is critical--but also Ukraine. It has been a long time since we have 
had their funding request--August of this year. They made a serious 
request for additional resources, anticipating the attrition they would 
suffer over the intervening months, long before the October 7 tragedy.
  It has been more than 2 months since President Zelenskyy was here in 
person asking us all personally for the help he needed to lead his 
country forward. It was at that time that Senator McConnell correctly 
and sincerely indicated, in his words, ``American support for Ukraine 
is not charity. It is in our own direct interests, not least because 
degrading Russia helps to deter China.'' But the foot-dragging has 
continued since then.
  Ukraine cannot wait. The OMB Director wrote earlier this week:

       [W]ithout congressional action, by the end of the year we 
     will run out of resources to produce more weapons and 
     equipment for Ukraine and to provide equipment from U.S. 
     military stocks.
       There is no magical pot of funding available to meet this 
     moment. We are out of money--and nearly out of time.

  So without our help, the Ukrainian people will be in a very desperate 
situation. We need to help them. We need to help our allies in Israel. 
We need to help those in Taiwan, and we need to help the innocent 
victims of conflict throughout the world.
  So this one-shot deal doesn't cut it. We have to come together, work 
together, and deliver assistance to Ukraine, to Israel, to Taiwan, 
humanitarian aid, and aid for our borders.
  With that, I will yield to Senator Klobuchar.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.
  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I rise 
today alongside my colleagues, Senators Murray, Reed, Shaheen, Schatz, 
and Heinrich to discuss the need to pass this supplemental funding 
package.
  I spoke earlier today about the importance of humanitarian aid--
humanitarian aid for the innocent civilians, Palestinian civilians in 
Gaza; humanitarian aid for people throughout the world. It is one major 
way that America has led through World War II and after, through the 
Cold War. Yes, we have led with our military strength, but we have also 
led by making friends and making sure people have what they need so 
they don't starve. And so many of those countries have gone on to do 
great things, to be great countries, to be democracies, to work with us 
to be trading partners.
  But, today, I am here to focus on Ukraine. We are at a pivotal point 
not just in American history but in the history of humanity. It is 
during moments like these that nations across the globe look to America 
for leadership. They expect our leadership.
  Yes, our friends in Ukraine are counting on us, but so are so many 
other allies as they look to see what we will do. This has never been 
America alone helping Ukraine. It has been all-in for many countries.
  Early in the conflict, I traveled to Poland with a number of 
Senators--Democrats and Republicans--and it was right when one of the 
first major loss of life had occurred in Ukraine at a military training 
facility. And we happened to be at the entry point where families were 
fleeing--people in wheelchairs, little kids with backpacks with nothing 
but their stuffed animal in it. That is what I remember.
  I remember the Polish people who had been invaded over the years by 
the Hapsburgs, by the Nazis, by the Russians, opening their arms to 
these Ukrainians, which they are still doing today--millions of 
refugees.
  We have played a very important role in this conflict. We have 
surprised the world, and I am certain we surprised Russia. And the 
Ukrainians have surprised them with their incredible courage when 
everyone had counted them out. This scrappy force who had been at the 
frontline for years already in Donbas and other regions in Ukraine who, 
once again, went to the frontline.
  We trained them. It is our equipment that has been so superior, as 
well as those from our allies in this fight. And what has happened? 
Well, since Vladimir Putin's unprovoked and unlawful, unjustifiable 
invasion last February, our Ukrainian friends have reclaimed half of 
the territory that is rightfully theirs. Vladimir Putin tried to 
capture Kyiv, but he failed.
  Senator Portman and I, in the middle of the war, went and saw that 
airfield where the Russians had come down in parachutes thinking that 
the Ukrainians would just fold. They didn't fold. They held their 
ground and they kept Kyiv.
  Vladimir Putin tried to wipe Ukraine off the map, but he failed.
  He tried to break the Ukrainian spirit, but he has made it stronger.
  He tried to take them down in the middle of winter last winter by 
cutting off their electricity. He threatened the biggest nuclear plant, 
not only in Ukraine but in all of Europe. There is no limit to what 
they will do. He has shown his true colors: capturing cities, 
slaughtering innocents, abducting Ukrainian children. But the Ukrainian 
people have shown theirs: defending their democracy against all odds in 
brilliant blue and yellow; cellists playing their song and their 
national anthem on burned-out steps; ballerinas going to the frontline 
in camo; a videographer delivering medical supplies to Ukrainian 
troops; the DJ at the national call center using her platform to find 
missing loved ones. It is not just the troops on the frontline; it is 
the entire country. And they are watching to see what they are doing.
  I met with the Ukrainian Ambassador today along with the Speaker of 
their House, along with their Defense Minister; and they are watching. 
The Russians are using everything that is said in this Chamber, 
everything that is done, because they are trying to use it against the 
Ukrainians. They are trying to break their spirit, break their 
backbone, break the morale of their troops. Well, it is not working. 
But they are watching.
  This is our moment. I think Leader McConnell put it best when he 
said--and I say this to our Republican colleagues when you think about 
the Iranian drones that were used by the Russians, when you think about 
the massacre in Israel and the fact that Hamas then went to Russia--a 
representative of this terrorist group went to Russia and met with 
leaders there:
  Think of it as an axis of evil: China, Russia and Iran. So this is 
not just a test for Ukraine. It is a test for the United States and for 
the free world. And the path toward greater security for all of us is 
simple: Help Ukraine win the war.
  Let us not forget what President Zelenskyy did in the hours 
immediately after the initial invasion, when everyone in the world--all 
those pundits that were at the Munich Security Conference that Senator 
Shaheen and I attended--people were counting him out. He did one 
incredibly brave thing followed by thousands of brave acts. He went to 
the street corner with just a few of his top advisors, and he stood 
there and looked at the camera and in the face of evil, in a statement 
of defiance, in a call to action to democracies everywhere, he said 
three simple words: ``We are here.''
  America heeded that call. Ukrainians heeded that call. And 
democracies all over the world united in every corner of the world, and 
we said: ``We are here, too.''
  The Ukrainian people have defended its nation against a tyrant, 
against one of the largest armies in the world. It is our moral 
obligation to stand by them. And talking to those leaders in the Baltic 
countries yesterday--Lithuania and Latvia and Estonia--they have been 
through this before. They have stood tall, but they know what the 
stakes are.
  If we let this happen and we let Putin just march right in next month 
because we refused to help, he is not going to stop marching in their 
eyes because they have seen it before. We must ensure that democracy 
triumphs over autocracy; that humanity prevails over brutality; and 
that the spirit of Ukraine carries the day.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.
  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I just 
want to make a point that we need a complete security package. All of 
these things are related, and all of them reinforce not only our allies 
and innocent civilians but also our own security and the future of the 
direction of the free world.
  We are not going to turn our back on Ukraine. How many meetings did 
we

[[Page S5799]]

have via Zoom or actually in person with Zelenskyy where so many of our 
colleagues said we would always stand with Ukraine after all that 
Ukraine has been through. And I remember being in briefings where 
people were predicting that Ukraine would crumble in a matter of days. 
And they stood up to the Russian aggression and they continue to stand 
up to Russian aggression and they have actually pushed Russia back. 
That isn't just in Ukraine's interest. That is in the interest of the 
free world.
  We need a security package that supports our allies in Israel, that 
supports the innocent civilians in Gaza that are also the victims of 
what Hamas has done. And we need a security package that stands with 
our allies in Ukraine.
  Mr. President, I would offer the rest of my time to my colleague from 
Hawaii.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.
  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. We are in a 
global fight against fascism and authoritarianism. We are seeing it in 
Putin's war in Ukraine, and we are seeing it with Hamas and the 
unspeakable horrors it committed on and since October 7. And we are 
seeing it with Xi Jinping's explicit desire to take Taiwan by force.
  These people do not hide their true intentions. They telegraph them 
to the whole world; and, worse, they are willing to do whatever it 
takes. Nothing is off limits to them. And that is the seriousness of 
the global threat of an increasingly coordinated fascist movement. And 
so to address one of these problems but not the other, to somehow judge 
one threat to be greater than the other, to say we are going to fund 
Israel but not Ukraine, is wrong. It is wrong morally because evil is 
evil, no matter where it occurs. And it is wrong strategically because 
we have a direct national security interest wherever fascism rears its 
ugly head.
  Take off your Ukraine lapel pins. Take back everything you said to 
President Zelenskyy.
  We were in the House when he addressed us. Everyone was anxious to 
shake his hand and express support. We put it into our Twitter bios. We 
put on the little lapel pin. We had him in the Old Senate Chamber on a 
bipartisan basis.
  Everybody is for Ukraine--unless it is hard. Everybody is for 
Ukraine--unless I can't get something unrelated on domestic policy.
  Everybody is for Ukraine when it is popular, when it is the thing 
that just happened. But the moment Donald J. Trump wants to defund this 
war, a lot of people go: Oh, my God, maybe I am not so enthusiastic 
about this.
  If you are for something, vote for the thing. There are a million 
other jobs out there where you can be for something and never be put to 
the test. I have an opinion. I am a guy at a bar. I am a person at a 
bus stop. It is Sunday night dinner. I have an opinion. But in this 
job, the way to determine whether or not you are for something is not 
what you said before the vote, but it is how you voted. And if you are 
for Ukraine, you have to vote to help Ukraine to defend itself in a 
land war in Europe.
  There is a land war in Europe. Vladimir Putin is trying to take 
Ukraine by force, and he might just do it if we abandon them. So, if 
you are for Ukraine, vote for Ukraine.
  I would now like to yield to the senior Senator from New Hampshire, 
Senator Shaheen.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.
  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I am 
pleased to be able to join my colleagues again on the floor of the 
Senate to support a supplemental funding request that recognizes the 
breadth of our national security interests in this country. That is a 
supplemental funding request that must include Ukraine, Israel, 
humanitarian needs, and the emerging challenges in the Indo-Pacific.
  The horrific events of October 7--2 months ago tomorrow--was the 
worst terrorist attack that Israel has faced. We know that over 1,000 
innocent Israelis were killed. It was barbaric. Now, both Ukraine and 
Israel face a similar threat against adversaries that seek to destroy 
them. A holistic national security supplemental bill is critical to 
protecting our interests--America's interests. We must pass an 
appropriations bill that supports our allies in Israel and Ukraine and 
that fully funds the other critical efforts that provide for our 
national security.
  My colleagues have been very eloquent tonight, but I want to add to 
their explanations about why continued support for Ukraine is critical.
  We should be proud that with strong bipartisan support, our country 
has stood with Ukraine since before the beginning of Russia's 
unprovoked invasion almost 2 years ago. We have done so with our NATO 
allies and our international partners, including South Korea and Japan, 
that recognize what is at stake even though they are a half a world 
away. Our allies and partners have contributed a total of $94.1 billion 
to support Ukraine's war and recovery effort. That is more than the 
United States has contributed.
  We had a chance earlier this afternoon in the Foreign Relations 
Committee to meet with the new Foreign Secretary, the former Prime 
Minister of Great Britain, David Cameron.
  I asked him: How will Europe--how will our allies in Europe--view a 
decision by the U.S. Senate not to provide funding to help Ukraine wage 
this courageous war?
  He said that it would have a dramatic impact in Europe, where we are 
seeing NATO stronger than he said he could remember in his lifetime 
because of coming together to support Ukraine and to oppose Putin. He 
said it would send a message about future support for Ukraine that 
would have a huge impact as we think about the international order and 
our ability to keep dictators like Vladimir Putin and President Xi of 
China, like the Ayatollah in Iran, like North Korea--those 
dictatorships--from thinking they can invade any country they want to 
if they happen to be stronger.
  Alongside our international partners, we recognize that the Ukrainian 
people are not only defending their land and freedom, they are fighting 
for the preservation of liberal democracies around the world.
  What Senator Marshall is proposing strips out the essential funding 
that we need to address the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party 
in the Indo-Pacific. It neglects the urgent and growing humanitarian 
needs for both Ukraine and the people in Gaza who are affected by this 
war. Failing to pass a national security package would embolden Putin, 
Iran, and the Chinese Communist Party. It would show our adversaries 
around the world that America is not up to the task of defending 
democracy and that we are not capable of standing by our friends for 
the long run.
  I remember the outcry in this body when the United States pulled out 
of Afghanistan, and I have to say I opposed that effort. But what do we 
think the pulling of our support for Ukraine is going to say to the 
rest of the world?
  We must be clear in sending an unequivocal message: America stands 
with our allies in the face of this kind of devastating attack that 
Vladimir Putin and Russia has made on Ukraine. To do that, we must pass 
a holistic funding package to underscore that America is not going to 
pick and choose when the United States stands on the side of freedom 
and democracy.
  Our adversaries want the United States to fall short in standing up 
for its allies; they want us to be divided. We need to show them that 
we are not divided but that we are united.
  When I am back in New Hampshire, my constituents continue to tell me 
that they support continuing to provide funding and help for Ukraine. 
We have a great humanitarian effort in New Hampshire called the Common 
Man for Ukraine that is headed up by a number of businesspeople. They 
provide supplies and support for the Ukrainian people and for kids. It 
is important that we fund a holistic response to address all of the 
issues that we are facing--Israel, Ukraine, the Indo-Pacific, 
humanitarian, and our southern border. And, yes, we should be able to 
come to a compromise on addressing border security.
  The Democrats stand ready to work with our colleagues in the Senate. 
We can come up with a compromise. We can do this in a way that is in 
the United States' national security interests.
  With that, I would like to turn the time over to Senator Durbin.

[[Page S5800]]

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Shaheen.
  In reserving the right to object, in 1978, before I was elected to 
Congress, I had the opportunity to take a trip to the Soviet Union and 
spend 3 weeks there. I saw a lot. In addition to the visits to Russia 
and Moscow, we visited countries like Lithuania, where my mother was 
born, and I witnessed firsthand the vision of Vladimir Putin and the 
Soviet Union.
  Make no mistake, his goal is to restore the Soviet Union, to take 
vulnerable countries and to subsume them with his own ego and his own 
view of the world. To visit Lithuania and see what they had done to the 
freedoms that we just take for granted in America was an eye opener to 
me: to see the cathedral in Vilnius, with its beautiful frescos 
whitewashed by the Soviets because they didn't want people to practice 
religion; to realize that they controlled everything--radio stations, 
newspapers--and to realize that they dictated who would win an 
election. There was no freedom in that country.
  That is the communist view. That is the Soviet view. That is the 
Vladimir Putin view. Are we in favor of that, Senator? I don't think 
so. I know you aren't personally, and you don't want to see that 
lifestyle imposed on people around the world any more than I do.
  In Ukraine, they had the courage to stand up and say to Putin: We 
will fight you to the death to stop this from happening.
  They have surprised a lot of people. I remember the briefing--the 
Senator from Kansas might have attended it--where we asked the 
intelligence experts: How long can Ukraine hold out when the Russian 
military machine comes marching in?
  They said: A matter of days--days--maybe weeks, but not much more.
  They were wrong. And do you know why they were wrong? Because they 
underestimated the Ukrainian people and what they were willing to do to 
protect their country.
  I have a special, as they say, selfish interest in this because I 
know that if Putin is successful in Ukraine, if this war criminal has 
his way and takes over the Ukrainian country for his Soviet Union--his 
new Soviet Union--the next country on the list is probably Lithuania 
and the Baltics: Poland, Latvia, Estonia. They are obvious targets 
because they are small and vulnerable, but they do have the NATO 
alliance standing behind them.
  So not only do I support the Ukrainian effort because of the courage 
of the people and their success and how much I abhor Vladimir Putin and 
his agenda, I also realize it is in America's best interest that 
Ukrainians prevail. It is in our best interest to stop Putin in Ukraine 
so that we don't have to use the NATO alliance to stop him in a country 
where we would be sending American troops to fight the battle. We 
should stand foursquare behind Ukraine because it is the right thing to 
do, and it is the right thing for America.

  Today, the Speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament came to my office, Mr. 
Stefanchuk, and he had a very simple message for me and the Senators 
who had gathered there: Without U.S. assistance, Ukraine will struggle 
and probably lose this war.
  Oh, he reminded us that they would fight to the death, and I am sure 
they will if it comes down to that dire situation. It also reminded me 
that this is not just another political debate. What we are talking 
about is assistance to a country where people today are fighting and 
dying for their freedom, a country for which we promised support for 
over 2 years, a country we need to stand by.
  Now you have asked us to support Israel. I will tell you this as 
well. Last week, many of us, on a bipartisan basis, watched videos from 
the October 7 invasion of the Hamas terrorists into Israel. It was 
horrifying. It was a terrible 40 minutes. I had to avert my eyes 
several times because I couldn't stand to look at the scenes of 
systemic rape, of attacks, murder. I will never forget those two little 
boys whose parents had just been killed outside the living room, 
sitting in their living room, saying: Are we going to die? It was these 
two little boys, and it was on tape. That was the reality of the 
atrocity of October 7.
  Israel has the right to exist. Israel has the right to defend itself, 
and I stand behind Israel as most Americans do. I want to see their 
support. But please don't give us this ``Sophie's Choice'' of picking 
our favorite child to die. I don't want either Israel or Ukraine to 
die. I want them to have bright futures, and to have that, they need 
the United States now more than ever. Don't separate our loyalty. Our 
loyalty should be common and unified for both countries, Ukraine and 
Israel.
  There are things we can say about humanitarian issues in the Gaza 
territories and what is happening there, but I am going to spare that 
for another day.
  I will just say this: I stand behind Ukraine. I stand behind Israel. 
Don't separate them. Let's stand behind both of them because they are 
both consistent with the values of the United States.
  I yield to the Senator from Washington.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on behalf of all the Senators who spoke 
so eloquently and forcefully tonight, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The Senator from Kansas.
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, what we have brought forward tonight is 
a House-passed, stand-alone package of aid for Israel. We didn't bring 
forward the entire security package, which already failed. We have 
tried that. It didn't work.
  So many of my colleagues across the aisle, indeed, spoke eloquently 
in support of Ukraine as well as Israel. I think back to what my 
college track coach said.
  He said:

       Don't tell me. Show me.

  So I am going to quote some words from the Democratic Party, and I 
want you to think about the words lining up with the actions. When 
people vote against the stand-alone aid for Israel, is that consistent 
with their own words?
  This is Secretary Blinken on October 13:

       No country can tolerate having a terrorist group come in, 
     slaughter its people in the most unconscionable ways and live 
     like that. What Israel is doing is not retaliation, it is 
     defending the lives of its people.

  Next is Secretary Austin on October 20:

       So, make no mistake: The United States will make sure that 
     Israel has what it needs to defend itself.

  Next, President Biden on October 10:

       So, in this moment, we must be crystal clear: We stand with 
     Israel.

  He says it again.

       We stand with Israel, and we will make sure Israel has what 
     it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, and 
     respond to this attack.

  Again, President Biden on 20 October:

       In Israel, we must make sure that they have what they need 
     to protect their people today and always.

  Finally, the majority leader, the senior Senator from New York, on 15 
November:

       We will not rest until you get the assistance you need.

  Folks, this is the opportunity. This is the time. This is the time to 
stand up for Israel, to make good on those pledges. I meticulously 
listened to my friends across the aisle and their arguments. What we 
are talking about today--what the bill is about today--is aid to 
Israel.
  As I listened carefully to their objections, their objection with 
this particular bill was with the pay-fors, and I respect that. The 
second objection was that they wanted more humanitarian assistance to 
Hamas and the people of Gaza as well, and I respect that as well.
  So bring us that bill--that stand-alone bill--that includes what you 
think is appropriate for a pay-for and what type of humanitarian 
assistance you want to make sure Hamas gets as well.
  But the real argument--the real argument made tonight--was to use 
Israel as a tool, to use it as a lever to fund Ukraine. And, again, I 
listened carefully. I tried to count how many times my friends across 
the aisle said ``Ukraine'' or ``Putin,'' and I stopped when I got to 
over 50. Israel was mentioned less than 10 times. They talked

[[Page S5801]]

about their national security package--their supplemental package--and 
they really should call it the ``lovefest for Ukraine'' package.

  I respect where they are coming from. I think it is how and how much 
and when do we give the people of Ukraine right now in a situation that 
has been a stalemate for a year--really, no progress made for a year.
  Two hundred thousand people have died in that war and 500,000 
casualties. There is no end in sight. This looks to me like a 7- or 10-
year war. It looks like it is Vietnam all over again.
  I remember the early days of Vietnam, when there were a few people 
saying: Slow down. Let's stop. There are too many people who are dying 
in this situation right now.
  Let's have that debate. Let's pull Ukraine out, and let's have that 
debate.
  I honestly believe, if we would have passed this Israel package a 
month ago and then worked on a Ukraine package starting then, we would 
have a Ukraine package done.
  What I wish is that my friends across the aisle were as passionate, 
though, about the security of our own southern border as about the 
lines of another country--the property lines of another country, their 
boundaries.
  I think I heard my friends across the aisle talk about the border 
maybe four or five times. The No. 1 national security threat--the most 
immediate national security threat to Americans--is our open southern 
border. Do we have to repeat the numbers? Ten million people have 
crossed the border illegally in the past 3 years, 1.7 million ``got-
aways,'' 70,000 aliens of interest, hundreds of known terrorists.
  All the lights are blinking red right now. All the lights are 
blinking red. That is what Director Wray said, yesterday, up here on 
the Hill, that on terrorist threats, all the lights are blinking red. 
And why wouldn't they, with these 1.7 million ``got-aways'' throughout 
the country doing who knows what?
  If my friends across the aisle are serious about a national security 
supplemental package, it starts with meaningful security at the 
southern border--meaningful security, not a process that actually 
promotes more people crossing the border.
  It has to include something that impacts asylum and parole. It has to 
literally secure the border, I think, even to begin this next debate. 
America needs to get its own house in order before we can help fix 
other people's houses.
  I understand the needs across this world are many. And my compassion, 
my heart, whether it is for the people of Ukraine, the people of 
Israel--I share those same compassions, but we just can't keep throwing 
good money after bad money. We have to have people with accountability. 
We have to make sure that there is a goal--that there is a goal that we 
can win.
  So, at the end of the day, the most prudent thing for this body to do 
would be to pass this standalone aid for Israel. Take it off the chess 
board. Let's get that one done. But, instead, my friends across the 
aisle want to use it as a political tool, a tool to leverage their 
funding for Ukraine. Let's have that discussion separately.
  I think it is time that this body do what we say we want to do. Let's 
not rest until we get this assistance to Israel.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.
  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, a couple of hours ago, Republicans voted 
down the motion to even begin debating the national security 
supplemental appropriations bill. They claim to support Israel and 
Ukraine, but, when it came time to act, they voted no.
  But let's be clear about one thing: Every part of this bill is 
essential for America's national security.
  We have two wars raging and a number of other threats brewing around 
the world, and this funding for our allies and our partners could not 
be more urgent. It is the difference between having the weapons to 
fight terrorists and authoritarians or not, having food and water for 
civilians caught in conflicts or not, having the defense systems to 
deter China from meddling in Taiwan or not.
  Our friends are counting on us to help them, and our adversaries are 
counting on us being too divided to do even the most basic task.
  America remains the indispensable Nation. It is the leader of the 
free world. It is the Nation that other countries, big and small, look 
to in good times and in bad, and it is a responsibility that we have 
never shirked away from. And now is not the time to start. Now is not 
the time to turn our backs on Israel, on innocent Palestinians in Gaza, 
on Ukraine, on Taiwan, or on any of our other allies and partners 
around the world.
  We are fighting an increasingly linked global fascist movement, and 
it is directly tied to our security interests. So we ought to act like 
it and pass this supplemental to keep our adversaries and competitors 
from redrawing the world as they wish, at the point of a gun.
  So let's start with Israel. There has been a lot of talk on both 
sides of the aisle about the merits of conditioning aid, as if it is a 
novel or unusual concept, except that it is not. The idea that having 
requirements under Federal law for any Federal appropriations, that 
that is somehow amounting to abandoning our ally or a break from the 
norms is belied by history.

  Whenever we approve Federal spending, whether it is for HUD for 
public housing or the Federal Highway Administration for repairs or the 
Department of the Interior for parks, we require detailed plans on 
exactly how the money will be used, and we expect to receive some sort 
of reporting on it afterward. It is also standard practice for our own 
Defense Department and aid to other allies, which we routinely 
scrutinize.
  So it should be no different for Israel and the IDF or Ukraine--and 
in a hot war, no less. There are millions of innocent lives caught in 
the crossfire, and we have every reason to make sure that Israel is 
using the weapons that we provide, funded by our own taxpayer dollars, 
in a manner that is consistent with international humanitarian laws and 
American values. That is taking every step possible to minimize 
civilian casualties.
  In many ways, the debate around conditioning aid is emblematic of the 
wider one around Israel and Palestine, which has become so hostile and 
so binary that people aren't even open to hearing the other side. It is 
near impossible to have a dialogue when all people are interested in is 
throwing rhetorical barbs and attacking the other side.
  If you condemn Hamas's unspeakable brutality on October 7 and hold it 
accountable for the death and bloodshed on that day and in the days 
since, then you are supposedly excusing the conditions under the 
blockade or you are accused of turning a blind eye to settler violence 
before and since October 7.
  If you question the manner in which Israel is waging war and the 
carnage and suffering the war has wrought on innocent lives, including 
children and babies, you are suddenly not sufficiently pro-Israel.
  If you call out the fact that anti-Semitism is on the rise here in 
the United States and around the world, that it is one of the oldest 
sicknesses and a scourge that must be addressed, then somehow you are 
indifferent to Islamophobia or the suffering of Palestinians.
  No, I know anti-Muslim and anti-Arab hatred are alive and well, too, 
and believe that they must be rooted out with equal force. And my heart 
breaks for the countless innocent lives being lost in Gaza daily.
  All of these things are true at the same time. They are in tension 
with each other, yes, but not in contradiction. There is an awfully 
messy and deeply, deeply contested history underpinning this conflict. 
So to strip away all that context and flatten all these complexities 
into a 15-second TikTok is a disservice to the Palestinian and Israeli 
causes alike.
  There are no simple and straightforward paths to peace here, but if 
we can't engage without first holding purity tests, if we can't 
acknowledge two things to be true at the same time, if we can't 
recognize each other's humanity, then we are not going to be able to 
build a just and lasting peace in the region.
  Almost everybody believes Hamas is terrible and should be eliminated. 
They want the hostages who were cruelly abducted and have spent 2 
agonizing

[[Page S5802]]

months in captivity to be immediately released. They are appalled by 
reports of Hamas's sexual violence against women and the drugging of 
hostages. And they believe Israel has a legitimate right and 
responsibility to go after the bad guys. The question is how.
  People are increasingly and understandably alarmed at the scale of 
human suffering and the high rate of civilian casualties in Gaza. It is 
our job, as Israel's closest ally, to convey that truth and to make 
clear that mass suffering actively undermines the possibility of a 
future peace. A whole new generation will be radicalized watching 
scores of loved ones die and entire neighborhoods leveled. That is in 
no one's interest.
  So our responsibility in the current moment is twofold: to provide 
Israel with military aid, which I have consistently supported and I 
will continue to support, but it is equally important to provide moral 
clarity and strategic counsel when actions cross a line.
  We do both of these things because we care. We also have an 
obligation to look at the future because, whether it is 10 months from 
now or 10 years from now, these two peoples need a way to live in 
relative peace and stability side by side--if not as friends, then as 
neighbors.
  Palestinians, like Israelis, deserve a legitimate, representative, 
and democratically elected government, and the only viable path to 
achieving that is through a two-state solution. It is the only way to 
guarantee a safe home for the Jewish people in Israel, and it is the 
only way to ensure Palestinians have a secure state of their own. A 
solution that does not recognize the humanity of both Israelis and 
Palestinians is not just, and a solution that does not give both 
peoples the condition to prosper without fear of violence will not 
last.
  Let's talk about the other part of this supplemental--Ukraine, which 
is, unfortunately, also all too familiar with battles over sovereignty 
and coexistence.
  Ukrainians have spent almost 2 years fighting against Putin for their 
very survival. And, make no mistake, Russia's failure to capture 
Ukraine so far is in no small part due to America's support and our 
leading role in rallying the world to stand up to Putin's aggression. 
We know that President Zelenskyy knows that and, crucially, Putin knows 
that. In fact, not long ago, he crowed that Ukraine wouldn't last a 
week--wouldn't last a week--without help from the West.
  So the consequences of failure to support Ukraine are not 
theoretical. They are dire, and they are dangerous. Ukraine, as we 
speak, is running out of bullets and other munitions. Already, our 
shipments have been diminishing in scope and frequency, as existing aid 
runs low, and it will be completely exhausted in a matter of weeks or 
months. Heading into the winter, the lack of additional assistance is 
likely to prove catastrophic.
  But some of my Republican colleagues here are willing to undermine 
the free world. I don't say this lightly. I like a lot of them. But 
they are willing to undermine the free world and let Putin win because 
they want hard-line immigration and border policy.
  Democrats have demonstrated a willingness to stretch here. 
Democrats--and I was texting some of the Republican colleagues with 
whom I work very closely, and I said: Look, we are already two-thirds 
of the way. We can't go all the way to your position. We cannot enact a 
bipartisan bill if it is a partisan bill. But the idea that, if we 
don't concede on a wholly unrelated matter, then Putin wins in a land 
war in Europe? Are we really doing this?
  And I want to just say one thing to my friends in the media--and God 
bless them. God bless the fourth estate for all they do, but I am also 
entitled to offer a constructive criticism: Stop pretending this is 
normal.
  (Ms. HASSAN assumed the Chair.)
  Stop pretending it is acceptable to take a major foreign policy 
issue--this is a land war in Europe. Vladimir Putin just decided to try 
to take a country by force. And what they say is: Well, we don't 
support that. We support Ukraine, but we see that we have leverage.
  By the way, this is not a rhetorical flourish of mine. Senator Cornyn 
said this 2 days ago. This is not a negotiation, is what he said. This 
is the price you have to pay. This is the price you Democrats have to 
pay.
  What are we doing here? This is a foreign policy supplemental. We are 
supposed to be for these things.
  I could have woken up one morning and said: You know what, if we 
don't enact my climate policies--which I feel urgently passionate 
about--then I am a ``no'' on Ukraine because I know I have leverage and 
they need every vote.
  The reason I won't do that is I am not bananas. I am a responsible 
legislator, and I know that is not the way you do things.
  The idea--I have never seen this before. I have only been here 11 
years. I am sure there is some historical precedent for it, but not 
recently have we tied a foreign policy objective to an unrelated 
domestic policy objective.
  What they will say is: Look, it is all security.
  Oh, come on. I understand the passion there is on the border. I 
understand the problem there is on the border. But it is not a foreign 
policy question, and the idea that we are going to let Ukraine get 
taken--Kyiv will be in Russian control because we couldn't make a 
border deal? We haven't been able to make a border deal for--well, 
since I have been here for sure and then 5 years prior to that. That 
stuff is hard. You don't take literally the most difficult issue that I 
can think of in the Congress to forge a bipartisan consensus and say: 
If we don't get it, then, I am sorry, Kyiv is just going to fall.
  That is no way to run a railroad. That is no way to be the 
indispensable Nation.
  You walk into any global convening--and I remember--I am looking at 
the Presiding Officer. I am sure the Presiding Officer has had this 
experience. You are a Governor, and everybody wants to know what you 
think, but when you are a Senator, you are not sure if people are going 
to be as interested in what you think.
  When you travel abroad, even when I was an appointed freshman 
Senator, people are hanging on your every word--not as a head of state 
but just as a representative of the U.S. Government. We remain the 
indispensable Nation. Everyone wants to know what we are going to do. 
Everyone wants to know what we think. They want to know what we are 
funding. They want to know what our priorities are. So we cannot 
forfeit that global leadership because we are fighting about something 
else.
  Now, again, Democrats have demonstrated by their negotiations, by all 
of our public pronouncement, that we are willing to stretch a little 
bit on this because it is that important. But it would be a hell of a 
thing for us to allow Vladimir Putin to win because we are too busy in 
a partisan battle about something totally unrelated.
  I yield the floor.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) for 5 minutes.
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, I want peace. I 
want a decisive victory over Hamas and an end to its hateful and 
destructive reign. I want Israel and Palestine to coexist safely, 
securely, and with prosperity for generations to come.
  It is difficult to talk about peace during wartime, but that is 
exactly what we must do. We cannot be distracted by disingenuous 
messaging bills that do nothing but grab headlines with no plan 
forward.
  As a person of faith, I have been taught not to hate, but I must 
admit that I have hated what I have seen in this Chamber recently. For 
as I hate anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and racism, as I despise 
homophobia and transphobia, as I reject and revile hatred and bigotry 
of any kind, I am also disgusted by the way those prejudices have been 
weaponized in our Chamber.
  We voted yesterday on yet another nonbinding messaging resolution 
denouncing anti-Semitism, H. Res. 894.
  To be clear, I have supported efforts to push back against anti-
Semitism. That is why I am supporting Mr. Nadler's plan to combat anti-
Semitism. It is why I am supporting Mr. Green's two-state solution 
resolution. It is why I signed on to Ms. Wasserman Schultz' letter 
regarding the safety of students on college campuses.

  Let's face facts. That was not what this resolution was about. This 
resolution offers no solutions. It does not seek to bring people 
together. This resolution was a cynical attempt to weaponize the very 
real fears of some of our Jewish friends and our neighbors to push a 
specific political agenda, one that is strikingly disrespectful to the 
Palestinian state, the State of Israel, and others who support the 
cause of free and sovereign Palestinian and Israeli states.
  On Monday, my colleague, Mr. Nadler, laid out how reckless and 
uninformed clause 4 of this resolution is. By making it the official 
position of this Congress that ``anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism,'' we 
are labeling the thousands of Jews in this country who don't believe 
their deeply held faith is intrinsically tied to the modern State of 
Israel as anti-Semitic.
  There are very real steps that we as the United States Congress can 
and should take to combat anti-Semitism in a productive and bipartisan 
manner. Condemning anti-Semitism wherever it rears its ugly head is 
critical, but continuing to vote on nonbinding resolutions week after 
week after week to score political, partisan points does not get us 
closer to a solution. It is disrespectful to the seriousness of this 
situation.
  Until Republicans are willing to address rising hate and fascism, we 
will be sitting here waiting without being able to accomplish anything. 
It is no better than moments of silence or thoughts and prayers with no 
substantive action to back it up, which were offered during the mass 
shootings in our schools, malls, and places of worship.
  We have work to do for the American people. The rise of anti-
Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, homophobia, and xenophobia are a threat 
to the American experiment in multicultural democracy, and there are 
Members of this body who are putting in the work to defend the more 
perfect Union that we built over the last 250 years.
  When Republicans who have been obsessed with these messaging bills 
are ready to join us, we will welcome them with open arms."

have underscored that something is rotten in the state of America's 
most elite universities, and there aren't many more glaring examples 
than Harvard.
  Last week, of course, Harvard's president refused to say whether 
calls for Jewish genocide would constitute harassment on her campus. 
Two months ago, in the immediate aftermath of the October 7 terrorist 
attack, she declined to condemn the Harvard student groups who openly 
declared that the murder of innocent Jews that day was Israel's own 
fault.
  Under her leadership, radical ``Students for Justice in Palestine'' 
have organized to spin terrorist propaganda and mostly succeeded in 
getting Harvard graduates blackballed by major corporations and Federal 
judges.
  One Jewish student at Harvard Business School was even assaulted on 
his way to study.
  And yet despite her abysmal record on combating anti-Semitism and 
mounting allegations of plagiarism in her own scholarship, the cadre of 
leftwing financiers and university administrators who make up the 
governing Harvard Corporation has affirmed their ``confidence that 
President Gay is the right leader to help our community heal.''
  Well, when you look at Harvard's history, this embarrassing lack of 
moral clarity is hardly a surprise. A century

[[Page S5971]]

ago, Harvard President Abbott Lowell proposed a numerical quota on 
Jewish students. His reasoning?

       The anti-Semitic feeling among the students is increasing, 
     and it grows in proportion to the increase in the number of 
     Jews.

  So one Harvard president says that the presence of Jews causes anti-
Semitism. A hundred years later, another says that calls for Jewish 
genocide really depend on the context in which they are made. Frankly, 
you would be forgiven for wondering whether anti-Semitism isn't just 
business as usual at Harvard."

respect for. Elected from Maryland's Fifth Congressional District, he 
is one of Maryland's finest and a Georgetown University lawyer. He 
served as majority leader twice, from 2007 to 2011 and then again from 
2019 to 2023. He is a person who has made a difference in my life and, 
in so doing, has made a difference in the lives of the people of the 
Ninth Congressional District, which I represent.
  I am so honored to have this opportunity to yield to the honorable 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), a lawyer, a former State senator, 
and still a Member of Congress. I respect and love my dear brother.
  God bless you. Merry Christmas and happy holidays.
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. He is one of 
the great gentlemen of this institution, a man of faith, a man of great 
intellect, a man whose heart and conscience form his stances on issues. 
I am so blessed to be his friend.
  Mr. Speaker, save for the gentleman from Texas, these seats are 
empty. The House of Representatives has adjourned for the year. We have 
adjourned to go home.
  Mr. Speaker, I say we have adjourned. We won't adjourn technically 
until we finish special orders and perhaps 1 minutes. We have no more 
business, but we have an unfinished agenda, an unfinished agenda to 
confront the enemies of freedom and democracy.
  Mr. Speaker, when President Zelenskyy came to our Nation's Capital 
back in September, he visited the Declaration of Independence and the 
United States Constitution in the National Archives. Standing before 
our Nation's founding documents, he said, and I quote President 
Zelenskyy: ``It is not the evil empire but the lack of unity that can 
bring freedom to its knees.''
  He reiterated that message this week as our Members prepare and are 
currently returning home for the holidays. We get to return home and 
celebrate with our families in comfort and warmth. Mr. Speaker, the 
Ukrainians huddled amid snow and mud on the front lines of freedom will 
not have that luxury. The tens of thousands of Ukrainian children 
abducted by Putin's regime do not get that privilege. Neither do their 
families.
  Zelenskyy is right, Mr. Speaker. We do face another evil empire 
today, a new axis of evil: Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un, and 
the autocrats in Iran and in other parts of the world and its many 
proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels, and others who 
all stand as threats to democracy and freedom.
  As these dictators and despots continue their assault on democracy, 
freedom, and international law, they watch whether the free world, of 
which we should be and for all intents and purposes are the leader of, 
waiting for that free world to stand together to oppose them. We will 
not have that opportunity until 25 days from now.
  These past few months, Congress had an opportunity to send them that 
message of unity and strength. We have not done that.
  Over 300 Members of the House, Mr. Speaker, voted to provide Ukraine 
additional aid all seven times it came to this floor. We are not not 
united on this issue. We simply have not brought it to the floor to 
express that unity and message to all the world.
  An overwhelming majority of Members also wanted to provide aid to 
Israel, including myself. Mr. Speaker, Speaker Johnson acknowledged the 
need to aid our allies, saying in Florida the other day: ``Ukraine is 
another priority. Of course, we can't allow Vladimir Putin to march 
through Europe, and we understand the necessity of assisting there.''
  Mr. Speaker, we have all gone home without undertaking that 
responsibility. Sadly, we apparently don't understand the urgency of 
that assistance.
  Instead of giving us a clean vote to act on that consensus, Speaker 
Johnson needlessly complicated the issue by tying it to his 
Conference's partisan proposal to overhaul our border policy.
  That decision, Mr. Speaker, was inconsistent with his cosponsorship 
of H.R. 395 back in 2017, which said the purpose of that bill was ``to 
end the practice of including more than one subject in a single bill . 
. . enacted by Congress.''
  Mr. Speaker, the reason we have not acted on Israel, the reason we 
have not acted on Ukraine, the reason we have not come to the defense 
of democracy and freedom in Ukraine and to oppose terrorism in Israel, 
the reason is contrary to that one-purpose bill that Speaker Johnson 
was the sponsor of. He wants to put multiple issues in that, including 
border security, which we have been working on for 15 years but haven't 
been able to come to consensus.
  We should be and we are in consensus on Ukraine, but we did not act. 
Evidently, they think that ethical principles only apply when it is 
politically convenient.
  I agree that we need to fix the broken immigration system and address 
the situation at the border, but this is not the way to do it, not at 
the expense of the defense of freedom and democracy.
  House Republican leadership spent the last week advancing a sham 
impeachment inquiry, a bill about whole milk, and legislation about 
duck stamps while Ukraine twisted in the wind. Our House should have 
had only one priority this week--ensuring democracy's survival.
  By failing to provide this aid, our Congress signaled to our friends 
and

[[Page H6974]]

foes alike that America chooses reluctance over resolve, doubt over 
determination, and division over decisiveness. That posture of 
uncertainty puts our national security at risk.
  The America First contingent of the Republican Party sends an even 
more damaging message. Time and time again, leaders of the American far 
right praise Putin, demonize Ukraine, and spread misinformation about 
the war.
  Tucker Carlson, once one of the most-watched people on American TV, 
has become one of the most-watched people on Russian state television, 
where propagandists often play clips of his segments.
  President Trump continues to play into Putin's hands, as well. Trump 
recently said that if reelected in 2024, he would end the war in 
Ukraine within 24 hours. There is only one way to do that--give up, 
retreat, turn tail on the defense of democracy and Putin.
  In response--and this is instructive--Putin said, ``We cannot help 
but feel happy about it,'' meaning Trump's claim that he would end the 
war in 24 hours. Giving up is the only way to do that.
  Mr. Speaker, we have seen this kowtowing just recently on Capitol 
Hill. This week, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted: 
``Zelenskyy is here in D.C. today begging for your money, and 
warmongering Washington wants to give him limitless American dollars.''
  That, of course, is not true, but it warms the heart of Vladimir 
Putin. She went on to say: ``How much money will Washington spend to 
slaughter an entire generation of young Ukrainian men as Washington 
fights its proxy war with Russia?''
  I can remember, because I have been here a long time, when Republican 
friends accused the Democratic side of the aisle of too often blaming 
America first. Of course, that is what Marjorie Taylor Greene said.
  It is disgusting to say that we are slaughtering Ukrainians when 
Putin's forces are doing just that every day.
  We are doing everything possible to keep Ukrainians alive. Ukrainians 
courageously give their lives, as so many of our American forebearers 
have done, in defense of their country, in defense of their 
sovereignty, and in defense of their people's lives. Ukrainians 
courageously give their lives to defend their democracy, their country, 
and their families.
  They will continue to do so with or without our support. Our aid, 
however, may well determine whether their sacrifice leads to victory or 
defeat. Yet, Mr. Speaker, the chairs are empty.
  In another tweet, Congresswoman Greene asked: ``Why doesn't anyone in 
Washington talk about a peace treaty with Russia, a deal with Putin 
promising he will not continue any further invasions?'' Putin's 
promises have no credibility.
  ``Washington wants war,'' she said, ``not peace.''
  That is a lie. Washington wants peace, but it is not prepared to pay 
for peace with being dominated by a dictator.
  Believe me, we want peace, but we want a peace that lasts. A promise 
of peace from Putin is worthless. He is a former KGB officer turned 
dictator who has built his career one lie, one deception, and one 
betrayal at a time.
  He already broke one peace agreement, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, 
in which Putin, on behalf of Russia, agreed to respect Ukraine's 
sovereignty and borders in exchange for Ukraine's nuclear arsenal.

                              {time}  1245

  He has the nuclear arsenal. Ukraine was either the third or fourth 
largest holder of nuclear weapons in the world, and they gave them up 
in return for Putin's promise that their borders would be secured and 
unviolated.
  Then it went into Crimea, and the West's response was weak. He is in 
Crimea today, notwithstanding the fact that that is under Ukrainian 
sovereignty.
  Putin went back on that pledge when he took Crimea. He didn't stop 
with Crimea, however. He went into eastern Ukraine, and there is no 
reason to expect that he will stop with Ukraine.
  Winston Churchill once said, an appeaser is one who hopes that if he 
feeds the crocodile enough, the crocodile will eat him last, but surely 
the crocodile will eat him.
  John F. Kennedy shared the same wisdom in his book, ``Why England 
Slept.'' He wrote, ``Any person will awaken when the house is burning 
down. What we need is an armed guard that will wake up when the fire 
first starts or, better yet, one that will not permit a fire to start 
at all.''
  The seats in this House are empty today while the fire threatens 
democracy and freedom in Ukraine, which is the front line of democracy 
and freedom today.
  Mr. Speaker, the fire rages. Our inaction only stokes the flames. If 
you don't believe me, listen to what Russian State TV is saying. Allow 
me to quote from the transcript of a broadcast earlier this week: What 
is happening in the U.S. is beneficial for us. That is a quote from 
Russian TV, controlled by Putin.
  The seats are empty, and Putin is happy.
  They went on to say: ``Ukraine is losing. Russia is winning. This is 
it. Their funding and weapons came to an end.''
  They were relying on the United States of America, that shining city 
on the hill that stands for freedom, individual rights, democracy, 
religious freedom. That beacon on the hill is less bright today because 
these seats are empty.
  Putin said: As of now, well done, Republicans--his words, not mine--
well done, Republicans, for standing firm. That is good for us.
  ``Us'' is Russia. ``Us'' is the dictator. ``Us'' is the aggressor. 
``Us'' is the international lawbreaker, criminal, and murderer.
  Just a few hours ago, at an end-of-the-year press conference, Vladmir 
Putin said of Ukraine: ``Everything is coming from the West, but the 
free things will run out some day, and it seems it is already 
happening.''
  In other words, Putin is saying the West is retreating from the 
defense of freedom, and the seats in this body are empty.
  There is nothing that Putin and the rest of the axis of evil likes to 
see more than our Congress divided, our country divided, and our 
coalition divided. We must not give them that satisfaction.
  If we neglect to send these resources without condition and without 
delay, we fail not only the people of Ukraine, but the people of Israel 
and the people in Palestine, to whom we want to give relief and 
humanitarian aid.
  We fail the America envisioned by our Founding Fathers, a Nation with 
the courage to stand up to forces of empire and despotism. We fall 
short of the principles they enshrined in our founding documents, the 
very same documents that President Zelenskyy made his pilgrimage to a 
few months ago.
  Mr. Speaker, when we return to the Capitol on January 9, each Member 
of this Congress will face a choice. Will we, as Zelenskyy said, allow 
freedom to be brought to its knees or, Mr. Speaker, will we be standing 
strong, standing united against the evil empire.
  Regrettably, the seats are empty today.
  Every week, every day, every hour we fail to act, we risk allowing 
the enemies of freedom to make that decision for us. We must not let 
that happen.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the former majority leader 
for the outstanding presentation. I think it is an appropriate way to 
bring this to closure today. May God continue to bless him and keep 
him.
  Mr. Speaker, as I shake Mr. Hoyer's hand as he passes me by, I am 
blessed to know that sometimes fortuitous circumstances can benefit 
you.
  Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss not to mention the newest staff member 
on my team, Eric Goodwine.
  Eric does an outstanding job for us in Houston. He not only assists 
me in the office, but he also is the principal person that gets me from 
point A to point B. Eric does an outstanding job of ensuring that 
things are arranged when I arrive at various venues, and I am proud to 
have him on the team.
  Eric, thank you again. Please forgive me for not mentioning you 
initially. All of this was from memory so charge it to being 25 three 
times and now working on my fourth 25th birthday, but there is a God 
that rules above and a fortuitous circumstance has made a difference.
  Mr. Speaker, may God bless this House, and may God bless the United 
States of America."

As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent the 
veto message on S.J. Res. 32, it be considered as having been read, 
printed in the Record, and spread in full upon the Journal.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The veto message is ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:

To the Senate of the United States: 
  I am returning herewith without my approval S.J. Res. 32, a 
resolution that would disapprove of the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau's (CFPB) final rule titled ``Small Business Lending Under the 
Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B).''
  The CFPB's final rule would provide small business owners, lenders, 
and the public with critical information about the $1.7 trillion small 
business financing market. It would bring much needed transparency to 
small business lending and improve the ability of lenders and community 
organizations to meet the most critical needs of America's sma11 
businesses. This rule implements a long-overdue piece of the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. It is also central to 
the effective implementation of the Community Reinvestment Act, which 
helps ensure that the needs of all borrowers--including low- and 
moderate-income borrowers--are met. But this Republican-led resolution 
would hinder the Government's ability to conduct oversight of abusive 
and predatory lenders, make it harder for 33 million small businesses 
across the country to assess lending opportunities and access capital, 
and make it more difficult for lenders and community groups to address 
the most acute gaps in capital access for minority- and women-owned 
businesses.
  If enacted, this resolution would harm all those that stand to 
benefit from expanded transparency and accountability. By hampering 
efforts to promote transparency and accountability in small business 
lending, Republicans are siding with big banks and corporations over 
the needs of small business owners. Small businesses are the engines of 
our economy, and my Administration will not support policies that hurt 
their ability to thrive and grow.
  Therefore, I am vetoing this resolution.
                                                 Joseph R. Biden, Jr.  
                                    The White House, December 19, 2023.


         Unanimous Consent Agreement--Veto Message S.J. Res. 32

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that, 
notwithstanding rule XXII, the veto message with respect to S.J. Res. 
32 be considered at a time to be determined by the majority leader in 
concurrence with the Republican leader prior to January 31, 2024; that 
there be up to 2 hours for debate equally divided between the two 
leaders or their designees; that the Senate then vote on passage of the 
joint resolution, the objections of the President to the contrary 
notwithstanding.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, there 
will be no further votes tonight. It is our expectation that we will 
finish all remaining business tomorrow.
  I yield the floor.

                                 Israel

  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by wishing all Americans and 
my colleagues here in the Congress a very happy and peaceful holiday 
season.
  Unfortunately, for the people in Israel and Palestine, that will not 
be the case. This is not a peaceful season for them. In Gaza, millions 
of people will end the year under constant bombardment, exposed to the 
winter or living in tents, wondering where they will find their next 
meal or clean drinking water or the medical supplies they need. What is 
going on in Gaza right now is an unmitigated humanitarian disaster, and 
we must not look away from it.
  We all know that the current war was begun by Hamas in their brutal 
terrorist attack against Israel, which killed some 1,200 innocent men, 
women, and children and took more than 240 hostages. Hamas is a corrupt 
terrorist organization which, before and after their attack on October 
7, has made it clear that their goal is to destroy the State of Israel.
  There is no question in my mind that Israel has the right to defend 
itself and respond against the perpetrators of the October 7 attack. 
But while it is clear that Israel has the right to respond militarily 
against that terrorist attack, it is also clear that the Netanyahu 
rightwing extremist government is waging that war--that response--in a 
deeply reckless and immoral way.
  A just cause for war does not excuse atrocities in the conduct of 
that war, and that is precisely what we are seeing. Israel has the 
right to go to war against Hamas. It does not have the right to go to 
war against innocent men, women, and children in Gaza.
  Israel's reliance on widespread and indiscriminate bombardment, 
including the use of massive explosive ordnance in densely populated 
areas, is unconscionable. Israel's military campaign will be remembered 
among some of the darkest chapters of our modern history.
  Consider the toll thus far--and I hope that every Member of Congress 
is prepared to consider the toll of what Israel is doing right now. As 
of today, nearly 20,000 people have been killed, 70 percent of whom are 
women and children.
  Let me repeat that. Nearly 20,000 people have been killed, 70 percent 
of whom are women and children. And more than 52,000 have been wounded 
since October 7. More victims are likely trapped under the rubble. 
Further, 135 United Nations workers have been killed as well as dozens 
of other aid workers.
  Unbelievably--and it really is quite unbelievable--nearly 1.9 million 
people--that is more than 85 percent of the population in Gaza--have 
been driven from their homes. Can you imagine

[[Page S6049]]

that? Eighty-five percent of the people have been thrown out of their 
homes, and, as we speak, they don't where they are going. They don't 
know what their future is. They don't have enough food, water, medical 
supplies, or fuel.
  Despite sharing their locations with Israeli military forces, more 
than 100 United Nations facilities have been bombed. More than 100 U.N. 
facilities have been bombed, and the U.N. reports--and, again, an 
incredible fact--that over 60 percent of the housing units in Gaza have 
been damaged or destroyed. Can you imagine that?
  My State of Vermont has 600,000 people. That is one-third of the 
people who live in Gaza, and I am just trying to think in my mind what 
it would look like if 60 percent of the housing units in Vermont were 
damaged or destroyed. But that is the case in Gaza right now.
  Let me put this in historical perspective and what that historical 
perspective means: that the destruction in Gaza is now equivalent to 
that of Dresden, Germany, where 2 years of bombing by the U.S. Air 
Force and British Air Force during World War II destroyed half of the 
homes in that city and killed about 25,000 people. Gaza has matched 
that in just 2 months--not 2 years, 2 months.
  This massive bombardment has made it impossible for the United 
Nations and other aid groups to provide basic necessities to the people 
in Gaza. As we speak, some 1.4 million people are sheltering in 155 
overcrowded U.N. facilities.
  Can you imagine that 1.4 million people are sheltering tonight in 155 
grossly overcrowded U.N. facilities? There is little electricity, food, 
water, medicine, or fuel; and hundreds of thousands of children are 
going hungry tonight in Gaza. The shortage of clean water and adequate 
sanitation facilities is leading to disease.
  And we can't even begin to contemplate the lasting psychological 
damage being done to the children of Gaza. Can you imagine a 5-year-
old, a 10-year-old, looking around for whether a bomb is going to be 
hitting him or her, wondering what kind of house, if any, they are ever 
going to return to or where are they going? Massive psychological 
damage is being done to the people of Gaza and especially to the 
children. The United Nations' senior humanitarian official said that he 
fears a ``breakdown in society'' amid this desperation.
  Let's be frank. What we are talking about in Gaza now is not just a 
humanitarian cataclysm but a mass atrocity.
  And what is important for every Member of this body to understand--
for every American to understand--is that all of this is being done 
with bombs and equipment provided by the United States of America and 
heavily subsidized by American taxpayers. We are paying for the carnage 
in Gaza right now--our bombs, our ordnance. There is no denying that we 
are, as a nation, complicit in this carnage.
  The Israeli military has made extensive use of massive explosive 
munitions in its campaign, including 2,000-pound and 1,000-pound bombs, 
and 155-millimeter artillery. These bombs and shells are manufactured 
here in America and supplied to Israel by the United States of America.
  The Wall Street Journal reports that the United States has provided 
at least 15,000 bombs and 57,000 artillery shells to Israel since 
October 7, including more than 5,400 of the huge 2,000-pound bombs that 
can flatten entire neighborhoods.
  The Washington Post reports that, in just 6 weeks after October 7, 
Israel dropped more than 22,000 American-supplied bombs on Gaza. And 
CNN reports that U.S. intelligence believes 40 to 45 percent of the 
bombs Israel has used in Gaza have been unguided ``dumb bombs.''
  These munitions were provided with the full knowledge they would 
likely be used in Gaza, a densely populated urban area with a large 
civilian presence. Parts of Gaza are more densely populated than New 
York City.
  The press, human rights monitors, and U.S. officials have confirmed 
that U.S.-provided bombs have been used in attacks that have killed 
thousands of civilians.
  This campaign, I am sorry to say, very likely violates U.S. law and 
U.S. policy. That is why I have introduced a privileged resolution 
under section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act. The resolution 
requests that the State Department provide information on any credible 
allegations of human rights violations in Gaza caused by indiscriminate 
or disproportionate military operations and the blanket denial of 
humanitarian access. It also requests a list of the arms provided to 
Israel since October 7 and a description of the steps taken to limit 
civilian risk caused by Israeli military actions.

  We will be voting on this resolution in January, and the best basic 
question that we will be answering in that resolution is, Do we support 
asking the State Department whether human rights violations may have 
been committed in the Israeli campaign in Gaza?
  That is not a tough question, and I hope that what we will see is a 
``yes'' vote from most of my colleagues.
  This should not be controversial. If you believe, as I do, that this 
campaign has been indiscriminate, then, it is our responsibility to get 
that question answered. If you believe Israel has done nothing wrong in 
Gaza, then you should want that information to support your belief.
  When we receive this information, we will then have a privileged 
vehicle to debate any necessary changes in U.S. security assistance to 
Israel.
  While I look forward to this debate, let me also mention that there 
are other things that we should be doing as well. The United States--
President Biden--has urged Israel to change its tactics with regard to 
their indiscriminate bombing. The President and people in the State 
Department have asked Netanyahu over and over and over again. 
Unfortunately, the Netanyahu government has not listened and has not 
been terribly interested in our perspective, despite the fact that we 
are supplying the bombs that they are using, despite the fact that we 
have provided them with $3.5 billion every year for a long time in 
military aid. Instead, the Netanyahu government is continuing its 
military approach, which is both immoral and in violation of 
international law.
  In my view, the United States must end our complicity in those 
actions, and, to do so, we must make two critical changes in our 
policy. First, while it is appropriate to support defensive systems 
like Iron Dome to protect Israeli civilians against incoming rockets, 
it would be irresponsible to provide an additional $10.1 billion in 
military aid beyond those defensive systems, as contained in the 
proposed supplemental foreign aid package.
  The bottom line is that we should not be giving more money to a 
rightwing extremist government in Israel to conduct a horrific and 
immoral military campaign that includes indiscriminate bombardment.
  Second, in my view, the United States should support efforts at the 
United Nations Security Council to end the bloodshed, such as the 
resolution expected tomorrow that would demand an ``urgent suspension 
of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and 
for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities,'' as 
well as the unconditional release of all hostages. This should be 
something we strongly support.
  As you may recall, last week, the United States vetoed a resolution, 
and I think that was disappointing not just to me but to many 
Americans.
  As we soon head home to our families, let us not forget the millions 
of people in desperate need both here in the United States and around 
the world. In Gaza, there is a horrific situation we can and must do 
more to address. We cannot forget about it. We cannot shove it under 
the rug. The time is now for the United States to stand up and do 
everything that we can to end this humanitarian disaster.
  I yield the floor.

                          Military Promotions

  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, as this day comes to an end, a very sad 
chapter in the history of this body comes to an end, mercifully.
  I stand here before you and my colleagues as the last Vietnam veteran 
serving in the U.S. Senate, a retired Navy captain, a grandson of a 
Gold Star Mother, and from a family who believes in the Navy blue.
  I want to say to the hundreds of military families who have endured 
the uncertainty of whether or not their loved ones--their husbands, 
their fathers,

[[Page S6050]]

their brothers, their sisters--were going to be able to assume the 
promotions that they have earned for their years of service in 
protecting our country and in helping to defend our Constitution that 
this sad chapter has come to an end.
  I want to apologize to those families. I spoke last week and urged 
that we turn this page and move on, and I am grateful that that has 
happened.
  I want to especially commend the work behind the scenes of our 
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed, an Army 
veteran, for the work that he has done in enabling us to end this sad 
chapter.
  I remember serving in a number of tours in Southeast Asia in the 
Vietnam war. In some of those years, we were not home for Christmas, 
for the holidays. We were on the other side of the world, and our 
families were back here in the States. Those were not happy days for 
us, and I know the last months have not been happy days for a lot of 
people in the armed services who deserve better.
  My hope is and my prayer is that at this Christmas season--at this 
holiday season, as we move toward Christmas--and as we move toward the 
end of the year and into a new year that the memories of what they have 
had to endure will fade and that what they will remember is that there 
are a number of our colleagues who stood up and said that this has got 
to end, and let's treat our military folks--all of them--with the 
respect that they deserve.
  We have a big Air Force base in Delaware, Dover Air Force Base. We 
have C-5s and C-17s. Through their large cargo aircraft, they provide 
an air bridge to Ukraine by literally carrying in those large aircraft 
the munitions, the supplies, and the materiels that are needed to help 
Ukraine fight back against the Russian invasion.
  I have kept very close tabs with the Air Force base, gosh, for 30-
some years. One of the challenges we have at the Dover Air Force Base, 
with the Delaware National Guard, and at military installations across 
the country is the workforce. We find, for civilians, there are all 
kinds of businesses and all kinds of employers. When I go visit them in 
Delaware and across the country and I ask them how are they doing, how 
are we doing, what can we do to help--we in the Federal Government and 
the State government--they say: We just need people to come to work, 
people who are employable and trainable who will come to work.
  We have similar challenges in our armed services these days. We need 
people who are willing to step up, be trained, and serve in the Army, 
the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard. We want 
to make sure, when they do that, that we will respect them and their 
families as we traditionally have done since the beginning of this 
country.
  So, as we wrap this up and prepare to go home for the day--at least 
in Delaware--I will be back tomorrow to, hopefully, do more of our 
Nation's business. I am hopeful we will, and I am encouraged by what 
has happened today.
  Again, to those who serve us throughout the world in the Army, Navy, 
Air Force, and Marines, the Navy salutes you, and God bless. To each 
and every one of you out there who is serving us, whether you happen to 
be in the States or someplace around the world, God bless you. Be safe, 
and thank you so much.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

  Mr. President, on the supplemental, as we continue to work to fund 
the government, Senate negotiators remain hard at work finalizing an 
agreement for a national security supplemental. As I have said 
repeatedly, it is a matter of the highest national urgency that we pass 
the supplemental. At stake is the security of our country, the security 
of our friends abroad--including Ukraine and Israel--and nothing less 
than the future of Western democracy. We cannot afford to let these 
issues go unaddressed.
  Passing the supplemental is one of the hardest things the Senate has 
done in a very long time. But for the sake of our national security, of 
our friends abroad, of our fundamental values, and of the strength that 
this country is regarded in in the rest of the world, we must stay the 
course.;  Iran

  Mr. President, now, on another matter, 3 years ago, I warned the 
Biden administration that it needed to take a tougher approach to 
growing threats from Iran and its terrorist proxies. I warned against 
removing the Houthis from the Terrorist Watchlist, and I called 
attention to how, even then, Iran was increasing its shipments of ever 
deadlier and longer range weapons to the terrorists in Yemen.
  But from the beginning, the administration chose to meet Iranian 
aggression with accommodation. The President's team operated on a 
profoundly naive assessment of the threat that we face. They abandoned 
pressure and squandered leverage in an attempt to revive a failed 
nuclear deal.
  They hectored regional partners under attack, as if their defensive 
actions against Houthi terrorists had provoked these Iranian proxies in 
the first place. And then they trumpeted the utterly fictional 
successes of their approach.
  Remember how the President's National Security Advisor described the 
state of the world last September--just last September--in an 
incredibly timed essay in Foreign Affairs. Just weeks before Iran-
backed terrorists would slaughter 1,200 Israelis on October 7, he 
claimed the United States had an ``enhanced deterrence'' to deter 
``further [Iranian] aggression'' and that the Middle East was ``quieter 
than it has been for decades.''
  And 3 years in, the price of these delusions has become inescapably 
obvious. To the extent that President Biden sought detente with the 
world's most active state sponsor of terrorism, he was woefully ill-
advised about the nature of the Iranian regime. To the extent that this 
administration ever seriously sought to deter Iran and its proxies, 
their efforts have demonstrably failed.
  So let's be absolutely clear. The United States is capable of 
destroying those who threaten our allies, our interests, and American 
lives. A global superpower is equipped to bring enormous force to bear 
against its enemies. But deterrence isn't just about capabilities. It 
is not enough for Iran to know that America has the means to demolish 
its military and its network of terrorists. No. Deterrence requires 
that our adversaries actually believe we are willing to use these 
capabilities. It requires credibility. And when credibility is eroded, 
it is not easily restored.
  It will be difficult for the Biden administration to convince Tehran 
and its agents that after 3 years spent scolding our partners for 
wanting to defend themselves from Houthi terrorist attacks, America now 
intends to do the same thing.
  It will be difficult for the administration to convince our 
adversaries that, after years of bending over backwards to accommodate 
Iran and wringing our hands over the use of military force against its 
proxies, we are now prepared to respond directly against Iranian 
targets.
  Restoring credible deterrence means identifying what our adversaries 
hold dear and proving we are willing to hold it at risk.
  Now, I am certain, Mr. President, that there are things Tehran 
considers more precious than empty terrorist warehouses in Syria or 
Houthi radar systems in Yemen. Iran uses proxies precisely because they 
consider them expendable. Taking pains to avoid killing these proxies 
or targeting Iranian forces and interests themselves tells Tehran that 
its strategy is actually working.
  President Biden owes it to the American people to explain how, 
exactly, he intends to compel Iran and its proxies to actually change 
their behavior.
  He owes it to the Nation to start explaining how the stakes of 
conflict in the Middle East ripple across the world; how the challenges 
we face in the Red Sea, Ukraine, and the Indo-Pacific are all 
connected; and how the cost of failing to meet them compounds.
  Unfortunately, the Biden administration is not alone in its failure 
to take its responsibility seriously. This afternoon, the Senate must 
take it upon ourselves to reject an attempt to degrade our Nation's 
credibility even further.
  The resolution brought forward by Senator Sanders is little more than 
performative leftwing politics. It is not, as our colleague would 
suggest, about authorizing a report on aid to Israel. It is not even 
about human rights. It is about tying the hands of a close ally locked 
in a necessary battle against savage terrorists.
  It is a gift to the leftwing anti-Israel activists.
  So colleagues who share a concern about the plight of innocent people 
in Gaza should set their attention on the Hamas terrorists who 
orchestrate their suffering--the terrorists who take hostages, steal 
humanitarian aid, and use their own citizens as human shields; the 
terrorists who go to loathsome extremes to imperil innocent human life.
  America's ally Israel takes extraordinary risks to minimize civilian 
casualties. Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Iran's other 
proxies across the region go to extraordinary lengths to maximize 
senseless death. We must not confuse one for the other. The distinction 
here is clear and boldfaced.
  Any colleague considering a vote for the Sanders resolution ought to 
consider what message they would like to send to America's allies and 
partners facing shared threats around the world and what message they 
would like to send our adversaries who doubt our resolve.
  Israel deserves America's firm support as it roots out terrorist 
killers and restores its security.
  Soon, the Senate will have an opportunity to make necessary 
investments in our capacity to support Israel and other threatened 
partners from Ukraine to Taiwan or the Philippines. As the threats to 
our interests grow, so do the costs of defending them.
  In just the time the Senate has been working on the national security 
supplemental, operational costs for U.S. forces in the Middle East have 
risen. As I have warned for weeks, using million-dollar missiles to 
defend against thousand-dollar drones strains an already insufficient 
inventory of long-range capabilities.
  The supplemental is our chance to expand our capacity to meet the 
national security challenges we face. The American people deserve 
leaders who are willing to take these challenges seriously.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered;  Israel

  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are all returning to a snowy 
Washington, DC, but it never ceases to amaze me, when I come back to 
the Nation's Capital from home, back in Texas, the disconnect between 
what people are focused on back home--namely, their jobs, their family, 
and, well, football. That didn't turn out so well for us this weekend. 
But the mainstream media and, of course, social media, which amplifies 
what people are talking about or the message that they want to convey--
the so-called influencers, which are, really, in some instances, no 
more than propagandists--and even our foreign adversaries are engaging 
in a nonstop battle to control the narrative here in Washington, DC, on 
a variety of issues, including the terrorist attack that occurred in 
Israel on October 7 of last year.
  Yesterday marked 100 days since Hamas terrorists murdered more than 
1,200 Israelis and took about 240 hostages. I traveled to Israel with 
several of my Senate colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee 
last week, and we witnessed the grief and the fear that has gripped the 
Israeli people over the last few months. It was a familiar feeling 
because it seemed very much like where the American people were 3 
months after the attacks of 9/11/2001, when al-Qaida killed 3,000 
Americans.
  In Tel Aviv, photos of the hostages who were still being held captive 
by Hamas lined the walkway. The photo of a 9-month-old baby held 
hostage literally stopped me in my tracks, wondering who would it be, 
what kind of person would take a 9-month-old baby and hold it hostage.
  In the face of every person I spoke with, from families of hostages 
to senior government officials, there was, understandably, a deep sense 
of shock, mourning, and anger. Again, it reminded me of how we felt 
after 9/11. We were grieving, we were shocked, we were angry, and we 
were absolutely committed to holding those responsible accountable.
  Our shared sense of purpose extended far beyond the borders of the 
United States. Our friends and allies around the world said: We have 
America's back. And they have supported our mission to destroy the al-
Qaida threat.
  That is exactly the kind of response you would expect when a 
terrorist group viciously attacks a friend--solidarity. Sadly, Israel 
has not received the overwhelming support that our country did in the 
wake of 9/11. In the more than 100 days since this war began, Israel 
has been criticized for defending itself. It has been villainized for 
going after the terrorist group that murdered, raped, and kidnapped its 
people.
  This is not a view just held by a few people. Anti-Israeli rhetoric 
has spread like wildfire across social media. It has taken root at 
elite college campuses and even here in the Halls of Congress.
  This past weekend, we saw the latest chapter in blaming the victim, 
as thousands of protesters gathered in downtown Washington, DC, to 
demand a ceasefire in Gaza. I would say a ceasefire would be great, but 
there is no guarantee Hamas won't continue to kill innocent men, women, 
and children. So it is just not feasible.
  Protesters chanted: ``Ceasefire now.'' ``End the war in Gaza.'' They 
carried

[[Page S109]]

signs that said ``Free Palestine'' and ``Let Gaza live.'' They accused 
Israel of being an apartheid government and outrageously said the 
United States was supporting genocide.
  Again, this was not a small protest. Thousands of people lined the 
streets of our Nation's Capital, and countless others protested around 
the world as part of a ``Global Day of Resistance,'' as it was called.
  I find it deeply disturbing to see this view shared by so many 
because it is completely divorced from reality. These protesters have 
the entire problem completely backward. Hamas is not a victim; Hamas is 
the aggressor in every possible sense, along with its state sponsor, 
Iran.
  While we were in Israel, my colleagues and I were shown footage of 
the October 7 attack, which was captured by Hamas terrorists. In other 
words, they were taking video of themselves killing innocent men, 
women, and children. They intentionally filmed all of these atrocities 
they committed so the entire world could see. But what we saw affirms 
that these are not victims in any sense--Hamas, that is. They are 
murderers. They are rapists. They are kidnappers, and they are 
terrorists.
  Hamas carried out the most gruesome atrocities I have ever seen, and 
I hope to never see those again. But we cannot, under any set of 
circumstances, allow them to be viewed as the victim in this war.
  This is not only Israeli blood on the hands of Hamas. Hamas is also 
responsible for immense suffering by civilians living in Gaza. Hamas 
raises vast amounts of money from the Palestinian people and outside 
donors, but that money does next to nothing to support a better quality 
of life for Palestinians. It isn't invested in schools, hospitals, or 
housing. Instead, it is used to arm Hamas's wartime operations.
  This terrorist group spends vast amounts of money building tunnels 
beneath the streets of Gaza--some 500 kilometers. It is a virtual city 
under a city. It allows it to hoard weapons. We literally saw 
manufacturing facilities for weapons and ammunitions in the tunnels. 
And, of course, it is used to keep food and fuel and to shield 
themselves from the violence above ground. Unfortunately, these tunnels 
are also used to hide the hostages, more than 100 of whom are still in 
Hamas captivity.
  Hamas builds these tunnels beneath hospitals and schools and other 
vulnerable locations in order to give credence to Hamas's lie that it 
is the victim, not the aggressor.
  Here in the United States, we are thousands of miles away from this 
war. Hamas didn't invade our neighborhoods. They didn't murder and 
kidnap our family or friends. And they aren't launching rockets that 
threaten us each night. But just because we aren't living with the 
daily realities of this war doesn't mean that we can be divorced from 
it. War is not just a battle of brute force; it is also a contest for 
public opinion.

  Hamas goes to great lengths to shift the narrative and build 
sympathy. It is not a new strategy, but it is deeply disappointing to 
see how many Hamas sympathizers are found on American soil. It is 
disheartening that scores of Americans are lapping up Hamas's lies. By 
claiming that Israel is the aggressor, they are playing directly into 
these terrorists' hands.
  We know war is ugly. It is tragic. It hurts innocent people and 
punishes the most vulnerable. William Tecumseh Sherman, a Civil War 
general said:

       War is hell. You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I 
     will. War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it.

  The realities of this war are nothing short of devastating. I 
understand the desire for the violence to end, and I hope and pray that 
it will soon. But we must remember this can only happen when the Hamas 
threat is defeated.
  The ultimate goal of Hamas, along with its state sponsor Iran, is to 
end the Jewish State, to wipe Israel off the map. That is the only risk 
of genocide in this war.
  We have a responsibility to call out and correct the falsehoods and 
mischaracterizations that are spreading in our own country. We have a 
responsibility to do our best to inform the American people about the 
facts and to make sure they understand who is the aggressor and who is 
the victim. And, in the end, I believe we have a duty to stand with our 
ally Israel as it does what is needed to root out the terrorist threats 
in its own country;      Israel

  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to speak a few minutes on the 
business before the Senate here. Apparently, S. Res. 504 will be taken 
up in about an hour or so. And this resolution basically requires the 
Secretary of State to submit a report to the Foreign Relations 
Committees of the House and Senate regarding human rights practices and 
violations against the State of Israel regarding their operations in 
Gaza.
  I can only imagine how this is playing in the Middle East. I can only 
imagine the joy that terrorist groups throughout the world have that we 
are even talking about such a proposal.
  The question, I think, for this body--certainly, for me--is, what was 
October 7? Was it just a continuation of a tit for tat between Israel 
and Hamas, or was it an effort by Hamas--a terrorist organization under 
United States law--an effort to kill innocent civilians in Israel at a 
rate we haven't seen since the Holocaust?
  I just got back. I would urge everybody in the body to go over there 
and take some time to visit the kibbutz--the kibbutzes in question, 
where Hamas came en masse, took over kibbutzes, cut the heads of 
children off, slaughtered people in front of their parents and their 
children, committed atrocities on par with the Nazis, if not beyond, 
and recorded them for posterity. So the response is, the U.S. Senate is 
going to ask for a report about how Israel is conducting military 
operations. Wow.
  Again, to the terrorists who are emboldened, maybe, by this 
discussion--this is going to go down in flames. The Senate is going to 
reject this big time. And here's why: I think most people--at least on 
my side--see October 7 as Pearl Harbor on steroids.
  What would happen after Pearl Harbor if some Senator or Congressman 
did something like this to America?
  Did anybody in America believe that the response after Pearl Harbor 
was anything but total war?
  The Japanese Empire and Nazi Germany were in league with Mussolini in 
Italy to destroy the world as we know it. A surprise attack against our 
forces on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, awakened this country, and 
we embarked on ``a noble crusade,'' I think as General Eisenhower--
eventually President Eisenhower--described, in destroying the Nazi 
regime and Imperial Japan. Nobody during those times would have 
suggested anything like this, because the only way you could

[[Page S112]]

destroy those regimes was to destroy the infrastructure around the 
regimes.
  The problem I have with this--not only does it empower the 
terrorists, it is the most tone-deaf thing maybe in the history of the 
Senate--is that it ignores the fact that Hamas has tunnels under 
hospitals, under schools. They use civilians as human shields. They 
routinely violate the law of war--and there is nothing in here about 
that. So all I can say is that the Senate will reject this idea.
  And to the left, what are you thinking? To the people who go in and 
try to interrupt cancer treatments in New York at a cancer hospital, 
what are you thinking?
  A ceasefire with Hamas only allows Hamas to regroup. Do you not see 
Hamas for who it is? It is a terrorist organization. They are religious 
Nazis.
  They are not taking up the cause of the Palestinian people. They are 
abusing the Palestinian people probably greater than anybody. A Hamas 
spokesperson said a few weeks ago that there will be another October 7, 
another October 7, and another October 7.
  Probably the biggest mistake Israel made was withdrawing from Gaza, 
because when they did, the Palestinians took over.
  To the Palestinians who want to live in peace with Israel, Hamas 
throws them off the roofs of buildings in Gaza.
  So we are dealing with the most barbaric organizations in the history 
of the world who are bent on destroying the Jewish people, are calling 
for attacks on the United States, and we have a resolution in front of 
us asking the Secretary of State to investigate the Government of 
Israel for war crimes.
  You talk about upside down and backwards.
  Just having been back from Israel, I can assure you the IDF is 
spending more time trying to protect innocent Palestinians than Hamas. 
What is odd about this whole thing is that Hamas is doing everything 
they can to expose civilians to military action, and Israel is trying--
I think in a reasonable way--to lessen the exposure.
  What do you call a group of people that build tunnels under hospitals 
and have command infrastructure under a hospital? You call them 
bloodthirsty terrorists who are trying to prey on the rules that exist 
in the law of war. By being under the hospital and the schoolhouse and 
firing rockets from apartment buildings, they have militarized these 
locations.
  So here's what I would tell our friends in Israel: This effort to 
have you investigated will fail in the U.S. Senate. Keep doing what you 
need to do to make sure there is no more October 7s. Make sure that 
Hamas, as we know it, is destroyed. Do the best you can to protect 
civilians who are in harm's way.
  A little bit about Gaza: From the time you are born, you are taught 
to kill the Jews. The most radicalized nation on the planet, I would 
say, is Gaza, and a close second would be the West Bank.
  When Germany and Japan were destroyed by military force, it took a 
generation to change the culture. So the Prime Minister of Israel says 
his goal is to demilitarize and deradicalize. Well, the way you 
demilitarize is you destroy Hamas as a military power. They have, I 
think, about 24 brigades.
  If we end this conflict with their military capability still 
standing, we will have made a huge mistake.
  The idea of anything but unconditional surrender in World War II was 
laughable. We used two nuclear bombs, and that is what was required to 
get Japan to surrender. So when you look back in history, the invasion 
of Japan that was being planned could have resulted in up to 1 million 
casualties of American forces. We brought that war to conclusion by 
using two atomic bombs that eventually allowed unconditional surrender. 
Anything less than unconditional surrender in World War II would have 
been a mistake.
  Anything short of destroying Hamas militarily would be a mistake for 
the ages. If Hamas is still standing militarily after this attack of 
October 7, we will all pay a heavy price.
  The world is watching.
  To the world: If you see Israel as the bad guy here, you are missing 
a lot. There is no moral equivalency in play. Hamas goes out of its way 
to make sure civilians are killed in large numbers. That is part of 
their strategy, to require Israel to use military force in a way to 
heighten the likelihood of death by integrating their military 
infrastructure with civilian infrastructure.
  So we will have a vote here soon. This resolution will fail. But the 
idea behind this resolution is scary to me.
  You need to go to Israel and get briefed about what happened on 
October 7--what happened to the women, what happened to the children, 
and what is happening to the hostages. If you go and have that briefing 
and you believe that the only response--and if you believe anything 
less than total war to destroy Hamas is required, I would be surprised.
  What would we do if this happened to us? What would we do to any 
terrorist group or government that brought about such atrocities 
against the American people?
  We would hunt them down. We would make sure they could never do this 
to us again. That is exactly what Israel has to do.
  It will be a long time before the populations of Gaza and the West 
Bank are going to be capable, I believe, of living in true peace with 
Israel, because if you have been taught from the time you were born and 
all through your life to hate somebody and to learn math by the 
following: ``If you had 10 Jews and you killed 6, how many would you 
have left?'' it is going to be a tall order to change that population.
  But here is the good news: We have seen from Germany and Japan that 
it can change, but it is going to take a lot of effort. I am willing to 
help the people in the West Bank and Gaza once Hamas has been 
destroyed. I am hopeful we can do a deal between Saudi Arabia and 
Israel in normalizing and effectively putting an end to the Arab-
Israeli conflict.
  I believe Iran is the root of all evil here and that this attack was 
partly due to stopping the normalization efforts between Saudi Arabia 
and Israel. I have been supporting the efforts of the Biden 
administration, and I want to publicly thank them for continuing to 
push. I will do all I can as a Republican to help President Biden bring 
about the normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. That would 
isolate Iran, and it would effectively end the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
One of the benefits of that deal would be to give the Palestinian 
people a better future.
  This resolution is not only off base; it is dangerous. It is doing 
harm. It sends absolutely the wrong signal at the wrong time.
  So, to the people who believe this is a good idea for the United 
States to launch an investigation of Israel as a potential war criminal 
after October 7, you have learned very little from history. The proper 
response by Israel is to destroy Hamas. The problem Israel has in that 
task is that Hamas is trying to make sure Israel kills as many innocent 
people as possible. Therein lies their dilemma. So this is a horribly 
bad idea.
  To the American people, put yourselves in the shoes of Israel: an 
attack, barbaric in nature, that is designed to destroy you. Hamas's 
goal is not to liberate the Palestinian people; it is to kill the Jews. 
Hamas's goal is not to bring about a better life for the Palestinian 
people but to destroy the lives of the Jewish people.
  They are religious Nazis. If you don't believe me, listen to them. 
They will not hide their agenda. They celebrate it. The SS tried to 
hide their war crimes. They tried to rebury bodies and destroy the 
concentration camps, but they were unable to hide their crimes. Hamas 
filmed their crimes. They want you to see what they were willing to do 
to babies and to women.
  The question for the world is, What is the right response?
  The right response, ladies and gentlemen, is, when you see evil, 
confront it. When you deal with people who are willing to destroy 
children or to rape daughters in front of the mother and father, you 
need to destroy them.
  So, not only will this resolution fail, I believe the U.S. Senate 
will ensure that Israel has the latitude it needs to destroy not only 
an enemy of the Israeli people--Hamas--but the enemy of mankind itself.
  I look forward to voting this resolution down, and I will be coming 
up with one of my own to try to correct the record.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, first of all, let me step back and wish the chair of 
the Appropriations Committee, Ms. Granger, a happy birthday.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this continuing resolution, which 
I hope is the last of the fiscal year 2024 appropriations process.
  This continuing resolution keeps the government open while the 
Appropriations Committees in the House and the Senate continue 
bipartisan negotiations on final 2024 funding bills that are in line 
with the agreement we have had since last June.
  I am encouraged by the conversations that have taken place since the 
top-line numbers were reaffirmed in the Schumer-Johnson agreement, and 
I appreciate the good faith and the respectful four-corner negotiation 
that took place to put forward this continuing resolution.
  I hope the current pace and tone will result in swiftly finalizing 
all 2024 funding bills in a bipartisan fashion.
  I might add that I think the Senate just voted a short time ago, 
overwhelmingly, I think, 77-18, to move forward the appropriations 
bills.
  House Republicans wasted the entire duration of the first continuing 
resolution and most of the second arguing over 2024 funding levels they 
agreed to last summer. However, I believe we have finally moved on from 
that charade, and there is now a mutual understanding that the only way 
to finally end the saga of 2024 funding is to write appropriations 
bills that can earn the support of both Democrats and Republicans in 
the House and Senate, bills that will likely need to pass under 
suspension of the rules like the bill we are considering today.
  While there may be a Republican majority on paper, more than 200 
Democrats will be needed to keep the government's lights on and ensure 
that the American people have uninterrupted access to the services and 
programs that help their families stay healthy, boost our economy, and 
keep us safe and secure.
  That is why Democrats in both Chambers have also made clear that the 
final funding bill cannot include any poison pill riders.
  In addition to negotiating and passing the 12 appropriations bills, 
Congress still must respond to President Biden's supplemental request 
for our urgent national security needs. We must quickly provide 
additional support to Ukraine in their fight against Russian tyranny. 
We cannot allow Vladimir Putin to be rewarded for perpetuating a 
pointless and bloody war. We cannot allow Russia to bully sovereign 
nations into ceding their territory to a tyrant.
  We know Putin believes that ``Russia's borders do not end anywhere.'' 
He is profoundly mistaken, and we must prove him definitively wrong.
  We must also support Israel's efforts to defeat Hamas while ensuring 
we do everything possible to protect innocent lives and provide 
humanitarian aid.
  Finally, we must work in good faith to resolve the very difficult and 
critical issues at our southern border. We have to come to a bipartisan 
compromise and show the American people Congress is still able to 
address urgent crises.
  Congress must avoid a shutdown. We must enact full-year spending 
bills and emergency assistance for Ukraine, for Israel, and for the 
civilians caught in the crossfire, as well as for our border and for 
the American people, as soon as possible. To those ends, let this be 
our last continuing resolution.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I do rise in opposition to the legislation that was 
just sent to the United States House of Representatives from the United 
States Senate.
  I just spent a good deal of time going around the country, traveling 
to Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. Madam Speaker, you might 
imagine why.
  I spoke to thousands of Americans. Not one American said: Please, 
Congressman Roy, add more money to the debt. Please, Congressman Roy, 
keep spending money we don't have. Keep deficit spending every year, 
bankrupting our kids and grandkids.
  Nonetheless, that is precisely what we are doing yet again, kicking 
the can down the road. That is what we do. It is what we do best in 
this Chamber. It is what we do best in Congress. It is why the American 
people are so frustrated with this town and with the swamp because it 
is a swamp that is entirely not drained.
  We are sitting here doing the same thing again. It is Groundhog Day 
in the House Chamber all the time, every day, yet again spending money 
we don't have.
  Last year, an agreement was reached with spending levels and caps. 
Now, I didn't particularly love those levels

[[Page H222]]

and caps. A number of us didn't. There were supposedly some side deals.
  Madam Speaker, does that sound swampy? Side deals. What was written 
into the law? What was written into the law was a level that was 
somewhere around a 1 percent reduction over last year's enormously 
bloated omnibus spending level, a 1 percent cut.
  Can this body possibly adhere to those caps? No. We can't do that.
  Last year, we tried to fix this place. We tried to do appropriations 
bills. We passed 10 appropriations bills out of the committee and 7 
appropriations bills off the floor. We tried to restore regular order. 
We had about 1,100 amendments. We tried to process those so the 
American people could see their Chamber working again.
  Nevertheless, what happened? Everything reverts back to the mean in 
this town, the same old story because a side deal is cut. We have to 
spend at a higher level, you see, Madam Speaker, and that is what is 
going on back and forth between the Senate and the House.
  The American people need to understand what is happening. This 
continuing resolution will fund their government at the same level as 
last year's massive omnibus spending bill that all of my 
Republican colleagues, all of them with the exception of two in this 
Chamber, were adamantly opposed to, voted against, spoke out against, 
put press releases out against, and campaigned against, and they are 
going to vote for it.

  Right now, they are going to vote to continue to spend at that level. 
Not only that, they are going to vote to continue to fund the radical 
progressive policies embedded in it, continue to fund the bureaucracy 
that is at war with the American people, continue to fund open borders, 
and continue to fund Alejandro Mayorkas even as we attempt to impeach 
him in the Homeland Security Committee.
  We are going to fund him. We are going to fund those open borders. We 
are going to fund the United Nations. We are going to fund the World 
Health Organization. We are going to fund UNRWA to give money to the 
Palestinians to give to Hamas.
  We are going to campaign against those things, but we are going to 
fund them.
  My Democratic colleagues want to hide behind side deals rather than 
adhere to the agreed-upon caps that would at least modestly reduce 
spending by 1 percent.
  That is what is happening in this Chamber, and we are going to do 
this CR in order to buy time to cut a deal that will increase spending, 
that will increase spending past the caps in order to honor side deals 
and to actually increase the funding for a Federal Government that is 
at war with the people whom I represent.
  That is shameful. Under no circumstances should we vote for that. 
Under no circumstances is this something that we should be supporting. 
We should stay here and do our work, but, instead, people said: Why 
can't you give the time back, Congressman Roy, so we can go catch our 
planes before the snowstorm gets in?
  I am sorry. I think maybe we should stay here and do our job and 
actually find a way to cut spending like we campaign on over and over 
again.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.


                             General Leave

  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the measure under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. Crane).
  Mr. CRANE. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her leadership, 
and I thank my colleague from Texas (Mr. Roy) for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, I agree with Mr. Roy's comments. This continuing 
resolution extends government funding at the same levels of the 
lameduck Biden-Pelosi omnibus.
  To be clear, this funding is going to continue funding Biden's 
disastrous policies, such as the Biden border crisis, Biden's war on 
American energy production, and a woke and weaponized bureaucracy.
  Our Nation owes almost $34 trillion in debt and counting, and the 
interest the Treasury Department must pay is steadily marching higher 
and higher. Over the next decade, annual Federal Government deficits 
are projected to double to nearly $3 trillion, and the cost of our 
interest on the debt will exceed the Pentagon's budget within the next 
10 years.
  Our Speaker, Mr. Johnson, said he was the most conservative Speaker 
we have ever had, yet here we are, putting this bill on the floor this 
afternoon without conservative policy riders. Conservatives don't have 
the chance to amend it. We are honoring the McCarthy-Schumer side deals 
from the Fiscal Responsibility Act that led us to vacate Speaker 
McCarthy in the first place.
  Talk is cheap, and the American people deserve better.
  The notion of fiscal discipline itself might as well be put in a time 
capsule. Congress considers no budgets. Legislation never hits against 
cost limitations. Every bipartisan disagreement is solved simply by 
spending more on the pet programs of the opposing party.
  This continuing resolution is a perfect example of how we have 
arrived at this unsustainable fiscal situation, and I urge my 
colleagues to oppose this legislation.
  The last thing I want to say is that I think it is rich to hear some 
of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle discussing the 
sovereignty of the Ukraine border and how necessary it is to protect 
their borders while we do nothing to protect our own.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for his comments.
  I would note that, in this bill, we will be voting to fund, as I 
said, a Department of Homeland Security responsible for the border 
crisis with wide-open borders and continued funding for the CBP One app 
being used to use parole abusively to flood the zone into Texas where 
Texas is having to spend $12.5 billion doing the job of the Federal 
Government.
  We will fund the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement, which lost track 
of 85,000 migrant children, and the Environmental Protection Agency's 
electric vehicle mandate to make two-thirds of new cars EVs by 2032, 
destroying our economy and piling up EVs on the lots of car dealerships 
around the country. We will fund the EPA's natural gas and methane 
rule, destroying access to reliable energy. We will fund the EPA's 
power plant rules aimed at knocking off coal and natural gas power 
plants, making us wholly dependent on wind and sun for energy, the 
unreliable energy that it is.
  We will fund the IRS doling out billions in IRA tax credits to 
corporations, many of them billion-dollar corporations.

  We will fund the World Health Organization undermining our own 
sovereignty and cozying up to the CCP.
  We will fund the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, which supports Hamas over our ally 
Israel. Even as we go out and give lip service to supporting Israel, we 
will be voting to fund their enemies right now, today, on the floor of 
the House.
  We will fund the pro-China, anti-Israel United Nations Human Rights 
Council.
  We will fund a weaponized Department of Justice and FBI going after 
parents like Scott Smith and Mark Houck.
  I have more.
  That is what we are doing. We are voting to fund a Federal 
bureaucracy that is at war with the American people while we indebt our 
children for generations.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
Good).
  Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Roy for yielding 
time.
  Here we go again. The more things change, the more things stay the 
same.

[[Page H223]]

  Fourteen months ago, we asked the American people to give us the 
majority. They entrusted us with the majority, running primarily on 
fiscal responsibility and securing the border. Thirteen months ago, we 
roundly condemned the omnibus, the $1.6 trillion Christmas omnibus that 
was put in place 13 months ago. Yet, we are operating today and now 
extending the very Biden-Pelosi-Schumer policies that are bankrupting 
the country, destroying the country, and under which the American 
people are suffering.
  Suffering, you ask. Yes. They are suffering under record 40-year high 
inflation and 20-year high interest rates. The average American family 
is paying $1,000 more a month for essentials than they were paying when 
the President was first elected 3 years ago.

                              {time}  1600

  We have a $200 billion monthly deficit, $2.5 trillion a year. As has 
already been said, we are $34 trillion in national debt. We will be $36 
trillion in debt by the time we get to this next election, and we have 
the majority in one-half of the legislative branch.
  When will that begin to account for something? When will that begin 
to matter for something? When you have the majority in one branch or 
one House of one branch, shouldn't you get half of what your policy 
priorities are? Shouldn't you get half of your spending objectives?
  Yet, what we seem to do over and over is decide what the Senate will 
take, what the President will sign, and that is what we send to the 
other body. That is what we send when we have the majority here in this 
very House.
  When is that going to matter? What are we prepared to do? What are 
the red lines that we are willing to draw, and what are we not willing 
to do just to keep government open?
  We say that we are getting things done. We say that we are working 
together. We say that we are showing that we can govern, and yet, we 
are not even willing to risk a temporary pause in the 15 percent of the 
nonessential part of the government in order to try to force change 
here in Washington.
  No. We are going to continue the status quo. We did this in May with 
the failed responsibility act. We did it with the continuing resolution 
in September. We did it with the continuing resolution in November. We 
did it with the NDAA. We did it with the FISA extension without 
reforms. Today, we are going to pass another major piece of 
legislation, predominantly with Democrat votes, minority votes, when we 
have the House majority.
  This is a loser for the American people. It is a loser for the 
country. How many times have we said on our side the border is the 
fight to have. The polls overwhelmingly show that is the number one 
issue of the American people. They blame the Biden administration. They 
blame the President for his failed border policies that are 
facilitating the border invasion. Just yesterday, 14 Democrats from the 
minority party voted with us to condemn, denounce, and call for an end 
to the President's open-border policies.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Virginia.
  Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speaker, we could have utilized that 
momentum to attach border security to this continuing resolution. We 
could have then dared the Senate to vote against it and dared the 
Senate to vote against funding the government and securing the border, 
and we failed to do even that.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, there are other things that we are funding that we 
shouldn't: The ATF rule banning up to 40 million pistol braces; the ATF 
rule massively expanding background checks without the consent of 
Congress; the Department of Education's student debt cancellation 
schemes, despite the Supreme Court ruling against them; public health 
agencies like the CDC, the NIH, and FSA held unaccountable for COVID 
tyranny, enforcing masks and vaccines upon our children; the Department 
of Veterans Affairs vaccine mandate, which I have introduced 
legislation to get rid of; the chief diversity officers at the 
Department of Defense and throughout government, indoctrinating people, 
pushing out a radical, leftist agenda with critical race theory and 
DEI; the Pentagon's abortion travel fund; the FDA's rule allowing 
abortion drugs to be shipped by mail; taxpayer-funded gender transition 
surgeries at the Department of Defense.
  We are funding all of that with taxpayer money and borrowed money. We 
are indebting our kids and our grandkids to fund the bureaucrats that 
are undermining the freedom of the American people, preventing them 
from being able to prosper, according to the rights given to them by 
the Almighty because this government is failing to do its job, and 
worse, is interfering with their God-given rights to do what they want 
to do for their families.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
Davidson).
  Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I always tell people back home: Beware 
of bipartisanship. The most bipartisan thing in Washington, D.C., is 
bankrupting our country, if not financially, morally.
  As my colleague from Texas just highlighted, it is not just the 
spending; it is all the terrible policies that are attached to the 
spending.
  We can tell by the way the time is structured, but it is bipartisan. 
It is 50/50 Republicans and Democrats. One of the mottos in the first 
unit I was in in the Army was, ``Deeds Not Words.'' The words are so 
good.
  I was down at the border with the Speaker and 60 of my colleagues, 
and we were going to fight. We were only going to fund a border that is 
secure. We were going to fund the government, but only if we secure the 
border. We were going to make the Senate a counteroffer, but by the 
time we could even get back to this town, our Speaker had surrendered 
to a four-corners deal, the very thing we said we wouldn't do.
  It is the deeds that are the problem. If we were back in the 
minority, we would be united again. We would be opposed to this. We 
were just a year ago. We were opposed to it. The words were good, and 
the deeds were also good, but now when we have the chance to govern, it 
seems we have lost our resolve.
  Who is getting hurt by this? The American people are getting hurt by 
this.
  None of us promised to come here and do this. We promised, as 
Republicans, things that are in conflict with the Biden 
administration's promises, and the only way we are going to do that is 
to force the vote.
  By going along with this, let's be clear, we are being buried. We are 
being buried by debt. We are being buried by crime. We are being buried 
by an invasion at our border, buried by fentanyl, buried by drugs, by 
suicide, by endless wars, by failing schools, by corruption. Frankly, 
it is a fatal overdose of government. I wish I could just wake up and 
it not be true, but it is.

  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  The American people are tired of getting a complete lack of 
representation from their Representatives. Nobody in this country looks 
at Congress and says: Wow. Heck of a job, guys and gals. Well done.
  Who would do that? Would we do that?
  By the way, it does not matter who is sitting in the Speaker's seat 
or who has got the majority. We keep doing the same stupid stuff.
  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have no problem with 
wide-open borders endangering the people that I represent. None. My 
constituents are the ones left holding the bag, and the people of Texas 
are the ones left spending $12.5 billion. My people are the ones who 
have had six kids die from fentanyl poisoning in the school district 
that I represent.
  It is not fun to smirk at that, is it? We are talking about dead 
children from fentanyl poisoning because of wide-open borders because 
of the policies of my Democrat colleagues who refuse to do anything 
about it. My colleagues won't do anything about the

[[Page H224]]

wide-open borders. I will continue to speak to my colleagues.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.
  Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I am addressing my comments to the Chair. I 
am addressing the Chair on behalf of the people that I represent who 
are dying in Texas because of Democrats, directly because of Democrat 
policies. They can shake their heads all they want, but the blood of 
the people in Texas is on their hands.
  My colleagues flippantly dismiss the fact that people in Texas are 
dying because of their policies, and the migrants that they pretend to 
care about are dying because of their policies. Then they lie and say 
that Texas is responsible for migrants who die in the Rio Grande River 
when their own Department of Justice offers the truth, which is, those 
migrants died in the river and were pulled out by Mexican authorities 
before Border Patrol was ever contacted.
  The Democrats have no problem lying to the American people just like 
Alejandro Mayorkas lied to the American people about Border Patrol 
agents whipping Haitian migrants.
  It is something that happens over and over and over again, but the 
question for my colleagues on this side of the aisle is: What are we 
going to do about it? Are we going to keep writing them a blank check? 
Are we going to keep saying: Here is more money, Secretary Mayorkas? 
Leave us exposed. Leave people dying. Leave children dying from 
fentanyl. Migrants are dying in the Rio Grande, so we can go out and 
campaign on border security.
  Why don't we do something about it?
  Here we are, again. Catch your flights. Get on out of Washington, 
D.C., before the snowstorm comes in, but give them all the money in the 
world they need to endanger the people that we represent.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Madam Speaker, everybody in this country expects us to do our job, 
and yet, we continually fail to do it.
  We continue to spend money we don't have, undermining our own 
national security, and our own well-being, funding a bureaucracy that 
is at war with the people that we represent.
  At some point, we ought to actually do what we campaign on. At some 
point, on both sides of the aisle, we should actually recognize that 
the American people expected a republic for the Representatives that 
they send to the United States House of Representatives to actually 
represent them.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Madam Speaker, as I said at the outset, this continuing resolution 
keeps the government open while the Appropriations Committees in the 
House and Senate continue bipartisan negotiations on the final 2024 
funding bills that are in line with the agreement that we have had 
since last June.

  I am so encouraged by the conversations that have taken place since 
the top-line numbers were reaffirmed. I appreciate the good faith and 
respectful four-corner negotiation that took place to put forward this 
continuing resolution.
  My hope is that the current pace and tone will result in swiftly 
finalizing all of the 2024 funding bills in a bipartisan fashion 
because that is what we are here to do. That is our job to govern. That 
is what the American people expect of us.
  Some of my colleagues would see that this government would shut down 
and don't care how hurtful that would be. I have a quick story to 
share.
  Today, on my way to a meeting in the CVC, a young woman who I see 
just about every day, called me over and with fear in her face, she 
said to me: Are you going to keep the government open? I said: We are. 
She said: Thank you. You don't know how stressed we all are and fearful 
of what will happen to our jobs and our families.
  Some of my colleagues would like to see a government shutdown because 
we don't pay a price. We don't give up our salaries. Maybe if we did, 
people would have a different view, but that young woman knows that if 
this government shuts down, she will not be able to take care of her 
family. That is what people should be thinking about in this body this 
afternoon.
  Madam Speaker, I say to my colleagues, let's do what is right for the 
American people and the people who work in this institution and who 
work in agencies all over this country. They need to know that we can 
govern, that we want to govern, and that we know how to govern.
  I believe that is possible in a bipartisan way. I have seen it in the 
past. I look forward to proceeding now.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1615

  Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, when Congress fails to do its job, 
the consequences are real.
  Families suffer, the economy takes a hit, and government costs rise--
all unnecessarily.
  The Senate Amendment to H.R. 2872--Further Additional Continuing 
Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024 proves one thing, this 
dysfunctional Republican majority is unable to govern without help from 
the Democratic Caucus.
  Instead of working to finish the FY 2024 funding process between now 
and when the first CR was enacted, House Republicans wasted time by 
ousting their own leader, further propelling the House into chaos and 
bringing partisan bills to the floor that not only have zero chance of 
becoming law but include massive cuts and poison pill riders that move 
us further apart, not closer to resolution.
  H.R. 2872 would avoid a government shutdown today, but kicks the can 
down the road and adds unnecessary complexities that will increase the 
likelihood of future shutdowns by creating two separate CR dates.
  This Continuing Resolution (CR) provides for continued funding at 
FY23 levels with two end dates:
  March 1, 2024: Agriculture, Energy and Water, MilConVA, and THUD 
Appropriations
  March 8, 2024: CJS, Defense, FSGG, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor 
HHS, Education, Legislative Branch, and SFOps
  The bill also includes a number of anomalies for public health 
extenders, Medicaid, Medicare, Human Services, Compacts, and Counter-
UAS Authorities.
  This legislation also lacks emergency supplemental funding for 
Ukraine, Israel, humanitarian assistance, childcare, disaster victims, 
broadband, Indo-Pacific allies, and a number of other pressing 
priorities.
  Although this legislation is flawed in many significant ways, a 
government shutdown would be devastating for Americans across the 
country.
  A government shutdown would hurt hard working families in Texas:
  172,877 active duty and reserve personnel serving our nation's armed 
forces in Texas would be forced to go without the pay they earn during 
a shutdown.
  The Small Business Administration would stop processing small 
business loans, halting a program that provides $2,742,702,800 in 
funding to small businesses in Texas every year.
  176,276 people flying through Texas airports every day would face 
potential delays and safety concerns due to staffing impacts on TSA 
agents and air traffic controllers.
  786,686 people in Texas would soon lose access to Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) 
benefits.
  168,413 federal workers in Texas would be furloughed or forced to 
work without pay, in addition to the many employees of businesses with 
government contracts who could be laid off, furloughed, or see their 
hours cut.
  Workers at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be sidelined, 
risking interruptions and delays to the 892 food safety, pharmaceutical 
manufacturing, and other inspections conducted in Texas last year.
  The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing 
housing loans, which provide $456,125,359 in funding to help 2,742 
families in rural Texas communities buy homes every year.
  The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing farm 
loans which provide $209,391,000 in funding for farmers in Texas every 
year.
  3,291,584 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) 
beneficiaries in Texas would lose access to benefits in a prolonged 
shutdown.
  5,413,161 people who visit national parks in Texas every year would 
be turned away or unable to fully access parks, monuments, and museums.

[[Page H225]]

  State governments would be forced to pay for federal services like 
the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, potentially 
risking benefits for the 20,846 TANF beneficiaries in Texas.
  A government shutdown would hurt working families, damage our 
economy, interrupt vital services, endanger our national security, and 
force millions of our troops and government employees to work without 
pay.
  It is time to get serious, it is time to do the work we are required 
to do as Members of Congress regardless of our political stripes.
  Congress has a responsibility to keep our government open, and I hope 
we can work with House Republicans and the Senate to facilitate the 
timely completion of full-year spending bills and a supplemental 
package.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger) that the House suspend the rules 
and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2872.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed."

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the PanCyprian 
Association of Florida's 2024 Person of the Year, Savas Tsivicos. A 
native from Cyprus, Mr. Tsivicos currently serves as Supreme President 
of AHEPA, the largest Hellenic-American organization in the country 
which has just celebrated its 100th anniversary last year. I'm proud to 
call myself an AHEPAN, a devoted member of the Tarpon Springs, George 
Washington Chapter No. 16. As the longest-standing Hellenic-American 
organization, AHEPA has helped to assimilate and educate Greek 
immigrants, like my grandparents, as they arrived in America. AHEPA has 
a lot to be proud of--its good works have elevated the stature of 
American citizens of Greek ancestry since its first convention in 
Atlanta in 1923. AHEPA has served as a beacon of all that is true and 
good about our culture.
  As a member of Congress, I have come to rely upon AHEPA's advice and 
counsel on a variety of issues, especially as it relates to my work as 
Co-Chair of the Hellenic Caucus and Congressional Hellenic-Israel 
Alliance. Together, we have worked to strengthen U.S. relations with 
Greece and Cyprus, secure religious freedom and protection for the 
Ecumenical Patriarchate, and promote solutions for Cyprus. With Mr. 
Tsivicos at the helm, AHEPA has continued to lead on the world stage 
calling out the intransigence of Turkey's President Erdogan. It has 
joined in the fight to prevent the sale of F-16s and F-16 modernization 
kits to Turkey. And, I am confident, that he will lead AHEPA to 
continue its work as an important partner in the charge to ensure the 
United States stands firm in its commitment to defend Greece against 
Turkish aggression.
  Domestically, AHEPA concluded an eight-year campaign that donated 
20,000 gallons of milk to assist victims of the Flint Water Crisis and 
helped neighbors recover from the East Palestine train derailment 
through a $7,500 donation; surpassed $1 million to sponsor over 100 
service dogs to help veterans who suffer from PTSD, collectively 
awarded millions of dollars in scholarships annually; and is set to 
begin work on two new affordable senior housing communities sponsored 
by chapters in Des Moines and South Bend.
  I subscribe to the old Greek proverb that a society grows great when 
old men plant trees in whose shade they shall never sit. The AHEPA 
pioneers who more than 100 years ago had a vision of eradicating 
bigotry and discriminination by promoting the ancient Hellenic ideals 
of education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, family and individual 
excellence to encourage a more perfect society are beaming with pride 
from above. The fruits of their vision and their labor continue to 
prosper because of the efforts from those, like Mr. Tsivicos, who carry 
forth the mission throughout our country. Again, congratulation to the 
entire organization and to Mr. Tsivicos on leading AHEPA to have 
another productive year. I wish him continued success and many more 
years of fruitful educational, philanthropic, and civic endeavors."

     former senior executives of the Federal Bureau of 
     Investigation with deep experience combatting dangers to the 
     nation, we write to express our concern about a current 
     specific threat that may be one of the most pernicious ever 
     to menace the United States.
       The danger arises from the nature of the threat itself. 
     Wars and espionage and bombings and riots are sadly familiar 
     delivery systems of instability, intimidation, and 
     insecurity. The country has faced these and more throughout 
     its history and has held together, though not without 
     struggle.
       The threat we call out today is new and unfamiliar. In its 
     modern history the U.S. has never suffered an invasion of the 
     homeland and, yet, one is unfolding now. Military aged men 
     from across the globe, many from countries or regions not 
     friendly to the United States, are landing in waves on our 
     soil by the thousands--not by splashing ashore from a ship or 
     parachuting from a plane but rather by foot across a border 
     that has been accurately advertised around the world as 
     largely unprotected with ready access granted.
       It would be difficult to overstate the danger represented 
     by the presence inside our borders of what is comparatively a 
     multi-division army of young single adult males from hostile 
     nations and regions whose background, intent, or allegiance 
     is completely unknown. They include individuals encountered 
     by border officials and that possibly refused into the 
     country, along with a shockingly high estimate of 
     ``gotaways''--meaning those who have entered and evaded 
     apprehension.
       In light of such a daunting, unprecedented penetration by 
     uninvited foreign actors, it is reasonable to assert that the 
     country possesses dramatically diminished national security 
     at this time. The nation's military and laws and other 
     natural protective barriers that have provided traditional 
     security in the past have been thoroughly circumvented over 
     the past three years.
       In 2021, the demographics of those crossing the porous 
     southern boundary started to shift. Young men from around the 
     world traveling alone and holding questionable motivations 
     dramatically increased in number to become the most common 
     profile of those breaching the nation's borders. A startling 
     number have been found on the terrorist watchlist or are from 
     countries designated as State Sponsors of Terror distinctly 
     unfriendly to the United States.
       This is particularly alarming in light of the Hamas terror 
     attack on Israel last October 7. Those of us who have fought 
     terrorism know that, historically, successful terror attacks 
     invite mimicry. We know, as well, that terror leaders 
     intentionally cultivate throngs of young men possessing a 
     certain easily-manipulated personality type to carry out 
     atrocities.
       It is stark to say so, but having a large number of young 
     males now within our borders who could begin attacking 
     gatherings of unarmed citizens, in imitation of 10/7 and at 
     the behest of a foreign terror group, must be considered a 
     distinct possibility. We would be remiss not to call out this 
     potentially grave threat in the most direct terms. The 
     warning lights are blinking.
       And yet, this very real concern does not seem to be getting 
     the focus it logically deserves. The Director of the FBI has 
     correctly assessed an elevated threat level since 10/7. But 
     relatively little discussion has followed highlighting 
     unsecured borders as a significant cause of this increasingly 
     dangerous environment. It is a troubling concern that needs 
     illumination, not avoidance.
       Any violation of the nation's immigration laws increases 
     risks, but the surge in numbers of single, military aged 
     males descending upon American cities and towns is alarming 
     and perilous. Additionally, they are not just from terror 
     linked regions, but from China and Russia as well--hostile 
     adversaries of the U.S. with aspirations to devastate 
     national infrastructure.
       For these reasons, elements of this recent surge are likely 
     no accident or coincidence. These men are potential operators 
     in what appears to be an accelerated and strategic 
     penetration, a soft invasion, designed to gain internal 
     access to a country that cannot be invaded militarily in 
     order to inflict catastrophic damage if and when enemies deem 
     it necessary.
       This new reality, this ``never seen before'' threat 
     deserves greater attention. The borders need to be secured 
     against these young men and those already here illegally must 
     be identified and removed without delay. This will take the 
     coordinated, cooperative efforts of the FBI, Department of 
     Homeland Security and the rest of the Intelligence Community 
     to achieve.
       We encourage these actions and much greater Congressional 
     attention to this threat. The country has been invaded, an 
     invasion that will continue as long as the nation's enemies 
     perceive it will be tolerated. Until it is stopped, the 
     United States is extraordinarily less safe and secure. 
     Knowing all of this, it would be a shameful travesty if some 
     terrible attack, a preventable attack, were to occur against 
     innocent Americans or the infrastructure that keeps the 
     nation safe and functioning.
       The government will have failed grievously in its duty to 
     protect.
           Sincerely,

  Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. In the letter, the signers said that 
America is facing a new and unfamiliar threat. As my colleagues know, 
you never want to hear our intelligence leaders speak about an 
unfamiliar threat, but these former FBI officials told us that we are 
suffering a soft invasion along our southern border. They are stating 
what is obvious to all of us.
  They noted that we are experiencing a surge--listen to this--of 
military-aged, single men who are pouring into our country over the 
southern border from adversarial nations, by the way, and from 
terrorist regimes.
  When we were at Eagle Pass in the Del Rio sector on January 3, with 
64 House Republicans, they told us that between 60 to 70 percent of the 
people coming across the border right there at that epicenter are 
single, adult males. They are military aged. These are not huddled 
masses of families seeking refuge and asylum. These are people coming 
into our country to do only God knows what, and we are allowing it. The 
Biden administration is allowing it.
  We have noted that they are coming from adversarial nations, from 
terrorist regions. We have no idea what they are planning. In fiscal 
year 2023, Border Patrol encountered illegals from 170 different 
countries, including hundreds from Iran, Syria, thousands from Russia, 
tens of thousands who

[[Page H332]]

have come in from China. Tell me that is not dangerous.
  In this letter, law enforcement and intelligence leaders are warning 
us that we may very well suffer a preventable terrorist attack here on 
the homeland if we don't immediately secure that border and remove 
these dangerous terrorists from inside our borders.
  House Republicans, of course, have acted. Last year, we passed the 
Secure the Border Act. This legislation would address the catastrophe, 
fix the asylum and parole processes that are so broken, and support our 
Border Patrol agents. The Senate could take that bill up today. Chuck 
Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate have been sitting on it in 
their majority for 9 months. They could do it right now. They could 
vote on that and send it to the President's desk, but they won't.
  Why? Because they are apparently okay with this, as well.
  While there may be some who think that it is not a good time to act, 
I disagree. Good policy, like a strong border, securing our Nation, and 
defending our sovereignty is always good politics. It is the right 
thing to do. It is the moral thing to do. It is the constitutional 
thing to do. It is the commonsense thing to do. I cannot, for the life 
of me, understand why the President won't agree with that.
  I have asked him myself, repeatedly: Mr. President, do something 
about it. He hems and haws and pretends that he doesn't understand what 
his authority is. He knows what it is.
  To be sure, we are not going to agree to a fix that doesn't actually 
solve the problem. We would be derelict in our duty if we did that. We 
know what the problems are, and we know how to fix them. Just like the 
Border Patrol official told us on that trip to the Rio Grande, House 
Republicans are not here to supply more buckets. We are here to stop 
the flow.
  Stopping the flow is not rocket science. It takes political courage. 
It takes transformational policy changes, and we know what policy 
changes will accomplish that. This is not conjecture. It is not 
Republican talking points. This is what the experts at the border, at 
the epicenter, tell us is necessary and needed, and it is insane that 
we will not supply it.
  We are also taking action this very week, right now. We are doing 
this every day. I thank Representatives Ciscomani, McClintock, and 
Moore for their hard work on four very important bills that the House 
is considering even this week. These bills will hold foreign persons, 
like criminal aliens, accountable for their crimes and keep them out of 
our communities.
  One of those bills is the Agent Raul Gonzalez Officer Safety Act, 
named for Border Patrol Agent Raul Gonzalez, who died in the line of 
duty while pursuing a group of illegal aliens. It would provide stiffer 
penalties for aliens who attempt to evade arrest by the Border Patrol.
  We will also consider a bill to ensure that aliens who are convicted 
of drunk driving are both deportable and inadmissible. Believe it or 
not, they are not currently.
  The third bill would provide stiffer penalties for illegal aliens who 
engage in Social Security identity theft.
  The fourth bill would ensure that aliens who have ties to Hamas and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization will not be granted entry into 
the United States.
  These bills are obviously commonsense measures to protect the 
American people. They should gain the support of Republicans and 
Democrats, but my guess is not many Democrats will support it.
  The Republicans in the House will continue to press for secure 
borders to ensure America's immigration system serves the national 
interest and does not benefit aliens who are a danger to our own 
people.
  Last Friday, President Biden came out in support of the Senate's 
deal, which we haven't seen yet. There is no text yet, but from what we 
have heard, this so-called deal does not include these transformational 
policy changes that are needed to actually stop the border catastrophe.
  Among the reported details of the bill--again, I am working off 
reports because I haven't seen the text, but apparently, reportedly a 
new authority would be created in the law so the President can ``shut 
down the border once daily crossings exceed 5,000 a day.''
  You heard that right. It is illegal to cross our border, but 
apparently we are concocting some sort of deal to allow the President 
to shut down the border after 5,000 people break the law.
  Why is it 5,000?
  If you add that up, that would be a million more illegals coming into 
our country every year before we take remedial measures. It is madness.
  We should be asking: What kind of enforcement authority kicks in at 
5,000 illegal crossings a day? The number should be zero. Zero. I don't 
care what congressional district you go into in America, poll people at 
random on the street, and ask them: Hey, should we allow 5,000 people 
to break our law each day to get a million into the country or should 
we stop it at zero and enforce our law?
  I don't know another word to describe it. It is madness. Anything 
higher is simply surrender. Anything higher than zero is surrendering 
our border, surrendering our sovereignty and our security. It is 
important to point out--and I want to make this very clear--in the 
President's statement on Friday, he falsely claimed that he needs 
Congress to pass a new law to allow him to close the southern border. 
It was a false claim. He knows that is not true.
  The President has been around Washington for a long time, and the 
President repeated his claim yesterday on the White House lawn. He 
said: I have done all I can do. Just give me the power I have asked 
for.
  Moments after his comments, the President's own spokeswoman 
contradicted him and said: There are things that are within his power 
to secure the border.
  Well, hello, of course there are. The law is very clear. Anybody can 
google this. Any American citizen can just pull this up and read it for 
themselves. Let's set the record straight. What he said is demonstrably 
false. I have explained it to him specifically. I read the President of 
the United States the law, the black-letter law, on the phone about 
2\1/2\ weeks ago. I said: Mr. President, it says very clearly you have 
all the tools and the executive authority necessary to reverse the 
catastrophe that you have created. He has those tools right now, and he 
has since day one.
  The Immigration and Nationality Act, for example, coupled with recent 
Supreme Court precedent, give the President ample authority to suspend 
the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens or impose any 
restrictions he may deem appropriate.
  That is the broadest authority that Congress probably has ever given 
a President, and it has been there for a long, long time. In fact, the 
very provision that I just read you was used by the Obama 
administration more than 19 times. It has been used, I think, 69 times 
by Presidents since 1980, but not by President Biden. He pretends it is 
not there.
  Any attempt by this President to pretend that he is a bystander 
bereft of any ability to secure the border is patently absurd, and we 
are going to continue to remind the American people of that. If we take 
a step back, and we consider the current catastrophe at the border, we 
can all see that our country is at a critical decision point.

                              {time}  1245

  We are at a moment where we have to decide right now as a Congress, 
as a people. We have to decide as the American people if we have 
borders or not.
  We have to decide if we believe in the rule of law or not. We have to 
decide if we are a sovereign Nation or we are not.
  House Republicans do believe that America has borders and that we are 
a sovereign Nation. We believe we must set limits on the number of 
immigrants who enter, obviously, and the American people have a say on 
immigration policy.
  Understanding who enters and enforcing our immigration laws are 
critical components to maintain a sovereign country. If you do not have 
sovereignty, you do not have a country.
  I also believe that border security is part of our solemn obligation 
to safeguard the well-being of our citizens and uphold the principles 
that define who we are as a Nation.
  In no sense is border security somehow an act of hostility to 
neighboring

[[Page H333]]

countries. It is exactly the opposite; because a weak border weakens 
America, a strong border is good for America, a stronger America is 
good for everybody around the world, and everybody in this Chamber 
should acknowledge that.
  Just as we lock our doors at night to protect our homes, we secure 
our borders to protect our homeland. My friends, that is our sacred 
obligation.
  We in the House Republican Conference desperately want to protect our 
homeland because we want to ensure that all of our children and 
grandchildren can continue to enjoy the blessings of liberty that we 
have enjoyed and that we have loved and experienced, and we can 
continue this grand experiment in self-governance we began in 1776.
  Here is the question. I will leave you with this: Does President 
Biden want that? Does President Biden believe in the rule of law? Does 
President Biden believe that we are a sovereign Nation? Does he believe 
that Americans and not those from other countries should be put first?
  Every American citizen should be asking these questions of the 
President and helping us demand his answers. We won't stop. We are 
going to continue."

Member designated in the report, which shall be considered read, shall 
be separately debatable for the time specified in the report equally 
divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not 
be subject to a demand for a division of the question.
  The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Bentz) and the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. Nadler) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Bentz).


                             general leave

  Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and 
to insert extraneous material on H.R. 6679.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Oregon?
  There was no objection.

                              {time}  1330

  Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  On October 7, 2023, Hamas initiated its brutal, unprovoked terrorist 
attack on Israel, the deadliest terrorist attack since the State of 
Israel was formed. There is no place in the United States for people 
who would commit such acts.
  H.R. 6679, the No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act 
ensures that aliens who carried out, participated in, planned, 
financed, provided material support to, or otherwise facilitated the 
attacks on the Israeli people that started on October 7 are 
inadmissible to and removable from the United States.
  It also makes such aliens ineligible for any immigration relief.
  Legislation like this is increasingly important because we have an 
executive who has implemented policies specifically designed to allow 
bad actors in the United States and to let them stay here.
  The Biden administration's policies have thrown every facet of our 
immigration system into chaos. Since President Biden took office, more 
than 7 million illegal aliens have been encountered on our southwest 
border. We are on track to reach 12 million by the end of President 
Biden's term.
  More than 3.3 million have been deliberately released into the United 
States. Another more than 1.7 million known got-aways successfully 
evaded Border Patrol agents to enter the country.
  Thanks to the Biden administration's open-border policies, the 
immigration court backlog has ballooned to over 2.5 million cases. In 
addition, arrests of criminal aliens have dropped exponentially.
  What does all of this mean? Illegal aliens do not face swift 
immigration consequences.
  Open-border policies present grave national security risks for our 
country and the world.
  The FBI Director warned the Judiciary Committee that the open border 
constitutes a massive security threat.
  Post-October 7, Germany, Belgium, and France have already seen lone-
wolf terrorist attacks inspired by the Hamas attack on Israel.
  Foreign nationals exploit U.S. immigration laws and policy to do us 
harm.
  We learned that lesson on September 11, 2001.
  Since October 7, here in the United States, at least one foreign 
national has already been arrested for plotting an attack against 
Houston's Jewish community--a Jordanian national who had overstayed his 
visa several years ago, but then applied for asylum and was issued a 
work authorization by the Biden administration.
  Just this week, we learned that last March, the Biden administration 
released an Al-Shabaab terrorist into the United States.
  It is not farfetched to think that October 7 terrorists would try to 
come here. It is imperative that Congress ensures that such bad actors 
will find no refuge in the United States.
  H.R. 6679 does just that.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, on October 7, 2023, Hamas committed a horrific assault 
on innocent civilians in Israel, murdering 1,200 people, including 32 
Americans, killing the most Jewish people in a single day since the 
Holocaust.
  Even now, Hamas continues to hold innocent men, women, and children 
in captivity. Not a day goes by that I don't think of the hostages:
  Of Kfir Bibas, who turned 1 in captivity, and his family, whose lives 
Hamas has used as a tool of psychological torture;
  Of U.S. citizens, like Hersh Goldberg-Polin, whose arm was blown off 
at the Nova music festival, and Keith Siegel, whose wife was released 
while he remains in Gaza;
  Of peace activists, like Oded Lifshitz, who spent so much his life 
helping Palestinians get access to lifesaving healthcare;
  Of the young women, like Noa Argamani and Agam Berger, who Hamas has 
used to torment and taunt their parents.
  Every day since October 7 has been a nightmare from which we have 
been unable to wake up. It has been far too much suffering, too many 
lives have been lost, on both sides of the conflict.
  H.R. 6679 has an important goal, ensuring that no one involved with 
the planning or commission of the October

[[Page H339]]

7 attacks can enter the United States or receive any immigration 
benefits.
  Our current laws already achieve this goal, however. Hamas has been 
designated as a terrorist organization by the State Department since 
1997.
  Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, or the INA, any noncitizen 
who has engaged in terrorist activity, provided material support to 
terrorists, or is a member of a terrorist organization, or a group that 
endorses or espouses terrorist activity is inadmissible to the United 
States.
  Furthermore, the national security-related bars in the INA are very 
broad. To bar an individual, the Secretary of Homeland Security merely 
needs ``reasonable grounds to believe'' that the applicant presents a 
risk to national security or is otherwise seeking to engage in ``any 
unlawful activity'' in the United States.
  This authority already applies to those who engage in or endorse 
terrorist activity, as well as those who provide material support to 
groups that take up arms against government forces. This is an 
extraordinarily broad provision that has barred even those who are 
forced to help armed groups.

  As such, this bill is largely redundant to current law. I certainly 
support the aim of this legislation. No individual who is involved in 
these heinous attacks should find refuge in the United States.
  That is why I intend to support the bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. But I do have some concerns about the drafting of this 
bill.
  For decades, when Congress wishes to prevent specific bad actors from 
entering the United States or accessing an immigration benefit, we have 
used bipartisan visa sanctions legislation. That approach would have 
the same effect the majority is attempting to achieve with this bill.
  Today, however, the majority has chosen to directly amend the INA to 
impose visa sanctions. This is beyond bizarre.
  Even after the September 11 attacks, we overhauled whole swaths of 
our immigration system, including creating the Department of Homeland 
Security, but we did not amend the INA to bar the people involved in 
the planning and commission of those attacks from entering into the 
United States. We used visa sanctions.
  During markup, I asked the majority to work with us to improve the 
legislation and ensure there were no unintended consequences.
  Unfortunately, they ignored our request. By not working with us, I 
worry that the majority signals an unseriousness about this issue that 
ensures that this bill will not become law.
  Despite these concerns, I will vote ``yes'' on the legislation, and I 
urge everyone else to do so.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Speaker, as I said, no member of Hamas or anyone associated with 
the horrific attacks of October 7 should be allowed to enter this 
country. Although that is already the law, I support the goal of making 
sure this is crystal clear.
  Though I have concerns about how this legislation was drafted and 
whether it would achieve its stated goal, I will support this bill with 
the hope that we can further improve it as it moves through the 
legislative process. I plan to vote ``yes,'' and I urge everyone else 
to vote ``yes.''
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, many of my Democrat colleagues joined with us 
during the Judiciary Committee markup to report H.R. 6679 favorably.
  I hope many more Democrats join with Republicans today to send a 
message that if you engage in terrorist attacks against our Israeli 
friends, you are not welcome here.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.


                  amendment no. 1 offered by Mr. Rose

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 
1 printed in part C of House Report 118-362.
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Add at the end the following:
       (d) Report Required on Participants in Hamas Terrorism 
     Against Israel.--Beginning not later than one year after the 
     date of the enactment of this Act, and each year thereafter, 
     the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a report to 
     Congress, including the number of aliens who were--
       (1) found to be inadmissible under section 212(a)(3)(H) of 
     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(H)); 
     and
       (2) described in section 212(a)(3)(H) of the Immigration 
     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(H)) and found to be 
     removable pursuant to section 237(a)(4)(B) of the Immigration 
     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4)(B)).

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 980, the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 6679, the No 
Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act. My amendment simply 
requires an annual report to Congress from the Secretary of Homeland 
Security on the number of individuals found to be inadmissible or 
deportable as a result of the underlying bill.
  Mr. Speaker, the October 7 Hamas terrorist attacks on the State of 
Israel were a barbaric atrocity that claimed the lives of over 1,000 
people. Hundreds of individuals were further taken hostage, and many 
were severely injured.
  In addition to condemning this act of brutality and supporting our 
ally Israel as it fights to eliminate Hamas, it is imperative that the 
United States imposes the absolute strictest possible immigration 
barriers to those who participated or otherwise facilitated the October 
7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel.
  Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to thank my colleague, Mr. 
McClintock of California, for introducing this vitally important piece 
of legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, my amendment is a commonsense pro-transparency measure, 
designed to help inform Congress on the number of individuals who are 
declared inadmissible or deportable as a result of this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition, although I 
do not oppose the amendment.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from New 
York is recognized for 5 minutes.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I support the gentleman's amendment, and I think it 
helps improve the underlying bill.
  I wish the majority had worked with us on this legislation to make it 
a visa sanctions bill. If they had, this amendment would not be needed 
because we would already have the data this amendment requires to be 
reported.
  However, given our concerns related to the drafting of this 
legislation and the potential for unintended consequences, I welcome 
this amendment so that Congress can unequivocally confirm that the 
number of people impacted by this bill is minimum.
  The Congressional Budget Office has already said this bill has no 
budgetary impact because it essentially restates current law. This 
amendment will help confirm the accuracy of that analysis.
  Mr. Speaker, I therefore support it, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, it is important that Congress receive continuous 
feedback on how effective the laws that we pass have become.
  By requiring an annual report to Congress on the number of 
individuals found to be inadmissible or deportable as a result of this 
legislation, we will ensure that this body is continuously well 
informed on how effective this bill is at keeping terrorists out of the 
country.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my 
amendment and ``yes'' on the underlying bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time."

highlight to my colleagues what exactly is happening in New York City 
as a result of Joe Biden's manufactured open-borders policy and the 
crisis that has been created in terms of a migrant crisis in New York 
City.
  This morning, a lot of New Yorkers woke up to the news that two of 
our NYPD officers were attacked by a mob of migrants. It is outrageous 
to think that individuals who came to this country and claim to be 
innocent asylum seekers would attack our police officers. That 
disrespect is unbelievable. Nevertheless, sadly, it is not the only 
time we have seen crimes like this taking place.
  Now, let's remember that the individuals who are coming through the 
southern border are paying thousands of dollars to the drug cartels to 
be smuggled here. My mayor is further incentivizing this by offering 
housing, food, healthcare, education, legal services, and laundry 
services. You name it. The taxpayers are paying to house those 
individuals who attacked those police officers.
  Nonetheless, that is not all we are seeing happen.
  Mr. Speaker, let me show you a few recent headlines all in New York: 
Illegal immigrant bites off police sergeant's finger after DUI bust, a 
driving while intoxicated bust; four migrants were arrested for 
stealing more than $12,000 in goods from Long Island's Macy's; New York 
City migrant pick-pocketing teams are the newest headache for the NYPD; 
asylum seeker was accused of killing--of killing--another at Randall's 
Island migrant shelter; a migrant woman was arrested after slapping an 
NYPD cop. A migrant was stabbed by girlfriend in a possible love 
triangle; migrants are behind the boom in New York City's red light 
district, Democratic mayor, Eric Adams, says.
  Democratic mayors are also saying this is destroying New York City. 
We are seeing New York City struggle to pay for this crisis that Joe 
Biden, again, created with his executive orders and 60 policy changes 
he made from the Trump administration that made our border wide-open.
  Chuck Schumer in the Senate refuses to do anything. They refused to 
pass our bill, H.R. 2, which would end this crisis today.
  I called ICE this morning, and I said that I want these individuals 
deported. The ones who are committing crimes like attacking our police 
officers, can we at least agree as Democrats, Independents, and 
Republicans that we should not tolerate that?
  What also really concerns me is that we have caught hundreds of 
people on the terrorist watch list at our border. As a New Yorker from 
the post-9/11 world, I have to question that there are 1.8 million 
people who have totally evaded law enforcement. In fact, the Customs 
and Border Patrol union leader told us today it is probably more like 4 
million. That is on top of the 8 million or so who have come, paid the 
cartels to come here, and have claimed asylum. We are not even talking 
about those people who turned themselves in. We are talking about the 4 
million got-aways. We don't know who they are, where they are, and what 
their intentions are.

  That should concern every single person in this body, particularly, 
the President of the United States.
  TSA is allowing individuals to board planes without identification, 
like the American citizens have to provide when we board planes. They 
can use a detainer. They can use a warrant for their arrest and all 
sorts of other documents that are probably produced, by the way, from 
fake identification that they used to come over the border. That is 
directly against the 9/11 Commission recommendations.
  The last thing I just want to talk about is that New York City is 
complicit because they are not complying with detainer requests.
  ICE is trying to do some of its job. When these people commit crimes, 
NYPD arrests them, and they release them back onto the street.
  Why?
  It is because they are forced to by the Democratic policies put in 
place by my city and my State. That is unfortunate.
  So, now, when these two individuals attacked the police officers, 
they were arrested, but they were released back onto the street. They 
weren't detained to be sent to deportation. In fact, now ICE has to try 
to go out and find them with no cooperation from local law enforcement 
because Democrats in New York have tied their hands.
  That is unconscionable, it is unsafe, and we have to make sure that 
the Democrats here, the Democrats over in the Senate, and the President 
stop playing with fire because this is a dangerous situation.
  As you know, Mr. Speaker, our ally in Israel is being attacked by 
terrorists. Iran is making threats against us saying they are going to 
commit attacks against us on our own soil. We have them attacking 
American soldiers at 160 different posts in the Middle East. We saw 
three soldiers killed by Iran proxies the other day.
  Yet we are going to keep this border open like this?
  It is unconscionable to me, and I expect action from the Senate.
  Allowing 1.8 million people to continue to pay the cartels to come in 
is not border security. So we expect them to either pass our bill, the 
Border Security Act, or pass something that is reasonable so that we 
can have a real discussion and debate and seal this border and make our 
country secure once and for all.
  Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
Rose).
  Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me 
tonight.
  Mr. Speaker, President Biden's policies at the southern border are 
working if the goal has been to let more than 8 million illegal 
immigrants enter the country. That is more than the entire population 
of my home State of Tennessee. If that is the goal, then indeed his 
policies are working.
  For example, look no further than on the campaign trail in 2019 when 
then-candidate Biden said to a crowd of Iowa voters: ``We could afford 
to take in a heartbeat another 2 million people.''
  While campaigning from his basement for the job of Commander in 
Chief, he never hid the fact that he would use his executive authority 
to ``increase the total number of immigrants able to come to the United 
States.''
  He was clear as could be. It was a promise made, a promise kept, and 
a promise multiplied four times over.
  That quote, which can be found online in seconds, gives much-needed 
context as to why he issued 94 executive actions on immigration in his 
first 100 days in office, fought to end the Trump-era remain in Mexico 
policy and title 42, and why the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
has released millions of illegal immigrants into our country in open 
disregard for the law. These actions, coupled with dozens more, 
continue to send a message to Latin America and around the world, 
including to suspected terrorists, that our borders are open.
  DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has willfully misused parole 
authority to flood communities with illegal immigrants, despite a 
conclusion from the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that the 
department could not simply parole every illegal alien they are unable 
to detain. Without any approval from Congress, Secretary Mayorkas has 
also created and expanded several parole programs. Again, this isn't a 
policy failure. This is their policy.
  Despite the department recently admitting that 40 percent--40 
percent--of catch and release migrants had disappeared, the open-border 
policies of this administration continue.
  Americans should know that President Biden already has all of the 
power and authority he needs to end this crisis immediately. Just 
compare his numbers to President Trump's. In December, 2023, alone, DHS 
reported 302,000 illegal immigrant encounters at the southern border, 
which is a 300 percent increase from December 2020.

  This marks 34 straight months where illegal immigrant encounters were 
higher under President Biden's administration than they ever were in a 
single month under President Trump.
  In the last fiscal year, DHS encountered 169 people on the terrorist 
watch list. That set a record as it was more than fiscal years 2017, 
2018, 2019, and 2020 combined--the majority of Trump's presidency.
  The Immigration and Nationality Act, coupled with recent Supreme 
Court precedent, gives President Biden

[[Page H361]]

ample authority to suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of 
aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens 
any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. The sad reality is the 
President isn't asleep at the wheel when it comes to securing the 
border. He is alert with both hands on the wheel driving it into the 
ditch.
  This is the America he told us he would champion. Despite his desire 
to usurp Congress, however, House Republicans will continue to hold his 
administration accountable for its unwillingness to enforce our laws. 
That is why House Republicans continue to push for H.R. 2, the Secure 
the Border Act of 2023, which would force President Biden to end the 
catch and release policy, pay more for Border Patrol agents, and 
restart border wall construction.
  Unfortunately, even with thousands of pounds of fentanyl pouring 
through and thousands of young people dead, I don't believe we will see 
a change of heart needed by this President to secure the border. In 
fact, it has become apparent that we likely won't see any impactful 
changes at our southern border until a new President takes office. 
Until then, I won't hold my breath waiting for President Biden.
  Mr. KEAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LaMalfa).
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for 
leading us here tonight and the opportunity to speak on several topics.
  Tonight, indeed, we passed a very important tax-related legislation 
that will be instructive in so many aspects of our society with 
investments and job opportunities. Indeed, I think the tax bill we just 
passed probably will be responsible for over 600,000 new jobs in 
research and development. There are tax credits, as well, for small 
businesses that are going to have the accelerated appreciation that is 
important to them for, again, small businesses and farms to invest in 
equipment.

                              {time}  2100

  One of the things I wanted to dwell on here a little bit was the 
importance of the disaster relief aspect that is in this bill that my 
colleague, Mr. Steube, from Florida was also working very strongly on 
and my colleague from the wine country in northern California, Mr.   
Mike Thompson, helped us with.
  We have had a situation where fire survivors or fire victims of 
destructive wildfires in northern California and other parts of the 
West, their taxation on the settlement money they had with the utility 
was deemed by IRS to be a taxable event.
  Even though they are victims of fire and have lost their homes and 
much destruction to their property, the dollars that were coming for 
restitution from a lawsuit were deemed taxable by the IRS. This put 
people out to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars of taxes that 
they really can't afford because they still have to put their homes 
back in order and build new homes and all this entails. It really 
wasn't intended as a taxable event in that sense.
  This package included important pieces of our original bill that was 
added as part of the tax package where folks have already, 
unfortunately, had to pay this tax because of the timing of things will 
be able to seek a refund. We will work with the IRS to make sure those 
refunds are expedited as best as possible but prevent future taxation 
on that and other disasters that have an award involved, like East 
Palestine and the issues in Florida.
  It is, indeed, a big success on that, as well as the other aspects of 
this tax legislation tonight that are going to be helpful for boosting 
our economy, boosting small business, and large business with 
investment and bringing over 600,000 jobs back to their country in a 
time we really need that investment and we need that boost.
  I am, indeed, very glad that we are able to accomplish that here 
tonight and look forward to the Senate taking it up and the President 
signing that legislation expeditiously. What is important about this 
nuance is that it be done before the upcoming tax season, April 15. 
Some have to file March 1 so they don't get caught, again, having to 
pay a tax prospectively for something they really aren't going to owe.
  We need to get the language in place, the rules in place on that 
after the successful passage in the Senate and by the President's 
signature.
  It was a great bipartisan effort; one we don't always see that often 
around here. We need to see more of that on both sides and having that 
big success.
  For the folks that were the survivors of the Camp fire, the Zogg 
fire, the Carr fire in northern California and others are going to be 
affected, their patience has been rewarded.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank them for their patience and for working with our 
office in giving us a chance to get it over the goal line. I would have 
liked to see it happen much faster, as well. Things have been tough 
around here and now we are able to have success with this tonight. We 
have a couple more steps to go, but I really strongly believe we are 
going to get there.
  This is going to be great for not only disaster victims, but all 
Americans, and the boost it will be for the economy with the broad tax 
package.
  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 22 seniors 
in New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District. Last fall, my team and 
I called on the residents that I represent to nominate a senior that 
had distinguished themselves through the contributions they had made to 
our communities.
  I was seeking hardworking, passionate individuals who have been 
living a life of public service, whether it be through their personal, 
professional, philanthropic, or volunteer efforts.
  In December 2023, I hosted my first annual seniors of distinction 
program to recognize the outstanding citizenship in New Jersey's 
Seventh Congressional District.
  I was honored to receive over 100 nominations from their friends, 
family, and neighbors, and had a difficult time narrowing it down to 22 
senior citizens who represent all six counties in my district.
  The seniors who were selected were chosen for their long history of 
giving back to their community and for continuing to lend their 
expertise, their experience, and their many talents to helping and 
supporting others.
  Every honoree had a long list of achievements, but, more importantly, 
a long list of charitable, spiritual, and philanthropic activities 
which they devote their time and energy to every day.
  Mr. Speaker, I will list these honorees:
  Barbara Agins of Somerville; Raymond Chimileski of Califon; Charles 
Fineran of Hackettstown; Dr. Thomas Foregger of Berkeley Heights; 
Jeffrey H. Katz of Springfield; Linda Kale of New Providence; Dr. Ken 
Kutscher of Raritan Township; Shirley Lakatos of Berkeley Heights; 
James McCabe of Westfield; Robert and Dace McLaughlin of Basking Ridge; 
Howard Meyer of New Providence; Leon Moreau of Landing; Mayor Al Morgan 
of New Providence; Mitchell Morrison of Sparta; Barbara Perkins of 
Warren; Dr. Nancy Polow of Scotch Plains; Herb Waddell of Berkeley 
Heights; Ronald Whalin of Basking Ridge; Dr. Rudolph Willis of Warren; 
Rita Jordan of Branchburg; Larry Orlans of Hopatcong; and, Rheva 
Smickel of Belvidere.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from the great 
State of New York (Mr. Langworthy).
  Mr. LANGWORTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey 
for yielding the time.
  This month the United States national debt hit a record $34 trillion. 
In fiscal year 2023 alone, the United States owed $659 billion in 
interest on this debt, and you can expect that number to be much higher 
this year.
  These numbers should alarm every American and make it clear that 
Bidenomics is not working, but the American people already know this. 
The White House repeatedly has lied, publicly praising themselves for a 
healthy economy and taking credit for meager postpandemic numbers.
  The American people aren't buying this false narrative. Hardworking 
Americans are still struggling to pay their bills and balance their 
family budgets while the President and the Democrats in Washington 
continue the reckless spending.
  According to a recent Axios poll, 72 percent of Americans say their 
grocery purchases are the top way they feel inflation in their lives, 
closely followed by gas prices at 56 percent.
  They also found that two-thirds of Americans are worried that food 
prices

[[Page H362]]

will continue to climb. I will remind President Biden and my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle that when you pass bloated spending 
packages that include Green New Deal funding or money to build a new 
park named for Nancy Pelosi or funding for gender programs in Pakistan, 
this isn't monopoly money that you are playing with. You are spending 
the hard-earned tax dollars of people who wake up every day, who go to 
work so that they can provide for their families. Our children, our 
grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren will still be paying for 
this debt long after all of us are gone from this legislative body.
  This kind of spending must end. We must reverse course now to secure 
our Nation's financial future and that is why House Republicans have 
been focused on cutting Federal spending. That is why we work to avoid 
a trillion-dollar Christmas omnibus and that is why we are going to 
keep fighting to put this country back on the right track.

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris).
  Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, the leadership at the Department of Homeland 
Security under the Biden administration is a complete and dangerous 
failure at our southern border.
  Last month, I joined nearly 60 of my House Republican colleagues to 
witness firsthand the Biden administration's catastrophe at Eagle Pass, 
Texas, in the Del Rio sector of our southern border.
  After being briefed by Border Patrol at the southern border, it 
became clear to me that this administration has allowed dangerous 
terrorists, drug traffickers, child sex traffickers, and other human 
traffickers to enter this country easily as a result of this 
administration's wide open southern border policies.
  In fact, since Joe Biden took office, 361 individuals whose names 
appear on the terrorist watch list have been apprehended attempting to 
cross our southern border illegally.
  Who in the world knows how many from that terrorist watch list were 
among the millions of got-aways, people who weren't apprehended at the 
southern border?
  In addition to these terrorists coming through our borders, more than 
54,000 pounds of fentanyl has been intercepted at American borders. 
Now, I know fentanyl well. I am an anesthesiologist by trade. We use it 
in the operating room all the time. 54,000 pounds of fentanyl is enough 
to kill the entire human population of the planet. That is the amount 
that was intercepted at the southern border. Only God knows how much 
was not intercepted at the southern border because our Border Patrol 
agents, instead of patrolling the border, are processing illegal 
immigrants into our interior through the asylum process.
  As we stood at the banks of the Rio Grande watching this catastrophe 
unfold at our southern border, the President of the United States that 
very same day that we were down there chose to help the flow of illegal 
immigration by actually sending his lawyers into Federal court to 
remove the razor wire that the Texas Department of Public Safety had 
put up to protect their communities from the invasion, the protection 
that Joe Biden was not providing to the State of Texas or to the rest 
of America.
  Now, while speaking to the press yesterday, Joe Biden, with a 
straight face, declared: ``I've done all I can do. Just give me the 
power. . . . Give me the Border Patrol, give me the people, the 
judges--give me the people who can stop this and make it work right.''
  Wow is all I have to say. The American people know that he refuses to 
admit that during his first 100 days in office, he took 94 executive 
actions on immigration, most notably including the halting of the 
construction of the border wall.
  Now, I will note, Mr. Speaker, it is kind of interesting. He has got 
a wall around his house, but he won't put a wall around our country to 
protect us from invasion.
  In August 2022, President Biden and his administration decided to 
make the border crisis worse by formally ending President Trump's 
successful remain in Mexico program. Yes, Mr. Speaker, the President 
could at any time reinstate the program under the same statutes and 
laws that were in place during President Trump. President Biden could 
reinstate remain in Mexico tonight.
  I would suggest if the President is listening, Mr. President, you 
asked yesterday what you can do. Pick up a pen, reinstate remain in 
Mexico.
  If that wasn't bad enough, the Biden administration announced on May 
10, 2023, that it would allow for the release of migrants into the U.S. 
with no way to track them. Millions of people entering the United 
States, given identification papers, even if we really have no idea who 
they are, and we are not tracking them at all. That is mind-boggling to 
most Americans.
  Make no mistake, Joe Biden absolutely has the power to stop this 
invasion. He is simply unwilling to do it and unwilling to use those 
powers.
  It is a reckless dereliction of duty for the Biden administration, 
our border czar Kamala Harris, and Secretary Mayorkas to continually 
allow the cartels to smuggle both humans and fentanyl into our streets 
without putting an end to this crisis. It is well within his power.
  Last year, in May, House Republicans passed the Secure the Border 
Act, a comprehensive immigration overhaul that would protect and secure 
the United States from illegal immigration, force the Biden 
administration to restart construction of the border wall, end catch 
and release--very important--and increase the number of Border Patrol 
agents to stop the flow of deadly fentanyl into this country.
  House Republicans passed that bill a year ago, but Leader Schumer and 
the Democrats in the Senate refuse to even take up the bill for a vote. 
Shame on them. If President Biden were really serious about fixing the 
crisis at our southern border, he would end it today by reinstating the 
successful border policies put in place by President Trump and 
instructing the Senate to pass H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act passed 
by House Republicans, tomorrow before they go home on their weekend 
break.

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I also want to highlight another 
piece of legislation that I am spearheading, H.R. 1547, the One Seat 
Ride Act, which I introduced with Representative Watson Coleman of New 
Jersey, and I am glad to say this legislation passed this House in 
December in a large bipartisan fashion.
  This legislation directs the Secretary of Transportation to conduct 
cost-benefit analysis of a one seat ride trip versus a transfer trip 
option during peak hours on New Jersey Transit's Raritan Valley Line. 
The results of this study would then be transmitted to key 
congressional committees.
  Currently, Raritan Valley Line passengers are forced to change trains 
at Newark Penn Station to access New York City and to make the same 
change headed westbound. A one seat ride allows passengers to take one-
time efficient trains from stations such as Westfield, Somerville, and 
Lebanon directly into New York City.
  Since the bill passed in this body, we are now one step closer to 
paving the way for a more connected and efficient future where 
commuters can travel seamlessly both eastbound and westbound at all 
times of the day and night. For New Jerseyans, this means more time at 
home and less time commuting.
  My priority will continue to be breaking down transportation barriers 
by enhancing our region's infrastructure. Again, I am proud that this 
bill passed the House, and I am working hard to get the Senate 
companion bill introduced and work its way through the Senate.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President and to direct their 
remarks to the Chair and not a perceived viewing audience."
https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/volume-170/issue-19/house-section/article/H381-1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22%5C%22Israel%5C%22+%5C%22Palestine%5C%22%22%7D&s=4&r=58,2/1/2024,House,ISSUES OF THE DAY,"Vol. 170, No. 19","Now, the first issue that I don't think has been adequately addressed 
around here is there has been, I think, misinformation spread on the 
conflict between Israel and Hamas or Israel and Gaza.
  We are supposed to be very sensitive and say Hamas is one group and 
Gaza is another group; but, in fact, Hamas--at least the polls show--is 
wildly popular in the West Bank and also, of course, popular in Gaza; 
and Gaza elected Hamas.

  I think too many people feel it is a historical conflict, and, in a 
way, we heard this in a speech from a prominent American earlier today.
  They are kind of treated as two sides of the same coin. In fact, that 
is not true, and I would like to talk a little bit more about how the 
people in Gaza should be so lucky, so grateful--realize how lucky and 
grateful they are that they are living so close to Israel.
  There are far too many Americans in general, and congressmen in 
particular, who define this conflict as between two sides apparently 
equal or close to equal.
  In fact, Gaza has been treated incredibly fairly and generously by 
Israel. When Gaza was set up as kind of an independent--I don't know 
what you would call it--principality a while ago, the Israelis removed 
the Jewish temples from the area despite the fact that in Israel 
proper, there are 400 Muslim mosques.
  In Gaza, Israel felt, well, okay, if they don't want them, they 
shouldn't have to put up with temples in that area.
  Not only that, they physically removed Israelis who were living in 
Gaza. Maybe you remember this. They physically grabbed and removed them 
from Gaza to the rest of Israel.

[[Page H382]]

  Apparently, the Gazans did not have to put up with Jews living in 
Gaza. That was bending over backward. It was almost barbaric.
  Then Gazans were able to work in Israel. Israel is a wildly 
successful Western country on the Mediterranean. As a result, I think 
the second biggest source of revenue for people in Gaza was working in 
businesses in Israel.
  That is their major source of income, along with foreign welfare that 
they didn't work for at all. It largely comes from Europe.
  When Gaza was set up as an independent or somewhat independent 
principality, they were given greenhouses so they could take over those 
businesses and make money.
  Of course, the Palestinians on their own destroyed the greenhouses 
because they didn't want to accept something that was tainted by 
previously being Jewish businesses, which is kind of offensive. I don't 
think the public really knows that.
  I think one way you can tell whether you are put upon and have things 
tough or whether you have things easy is other people want to be like 
you, or people are running away from you.
  Already, at the time of the barbaric acts in October, there were over 
10,000 people from Thailand living in Israel and working in Israel. In 
other words, they came halfway around the globe from Thailand to Israel 
to work in Israel.
  At first, I was kind of stumped when they said that Thai nationals 
were killed by Hamas in Israel or Thai nationals were taken hostage in 
Israel.
  I thought what in the world are people from Thailand doing in Israel. 
Actually, they knew it was so wonderful working in Israel that they 
came halfway around the globe to work there.
  As a practical matter now, since Israel can no longer trust the 
Palestinians, those jobs are going to be opened up to people around the 
world.
  Not enough people know that, right; be they people from India--which 
is a booming country in its own right--Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Kenya, 
Malawi.
  They are coming from around the world to replace the Palestinian 
workers who are fortunate enough to have jobs in Israel.
  By the way, those Gaza citizens who worked in Israel were making far 
more money than your average person in the Arab world is making. They 
just lucked out that they were near enough to Israel, and they could 
grab these good jobs.
  Now that they kicked them away by killing so many Israelis, they are 
going to be replaced by other people all around the world.
  One thing that I think has not been publicized anywhere near enough 
is there are talks of 25,000 people from Ecuador who may come to Israel 
to work.
  Think about that. The Gazans think they are so put upon that they 
have to kill the Israelis, chop off their heads, chop off the heads of 
children, and, meanwhile, people in Ecuador are coming halfway around 
the world with possible plans of taking 25,000 Ecuadorians to live in 
Israel and take those jobs.
  That is something that every American should know. They don't know it 
because the American press is not covering it.
  They are allowing people to believe, oh, those poor Gazans. They 
don't realize that people from Thailand or Ecuador or the southern part 
of Africa would move halfway around the world--goodbye to their 
families--to be in heaven, to work in Israel.

  By the way, there is another item that ought to be pointed out with 
regard to how well the Arabs in Israel have it.
  Not long ago, there were efforts made for a two-State solution. Bad 
idea, but, nevertheless, they talked about doing it.
  At the time when they talked about it, they thought okay, in this 
area of land we call Israel, we are going to have some of that land be 
Israel and some of that land be Palestine.
  So people don't have to be offended, the Israelis living in what 
would become Palestine would move to Israel, and the Palestinians 
living in what would become Israel will move to Palestine.
  It seemed at first blush kind of a commonsense thing. You know who 
screamed bloody murder? The Palestinians who were going to have to move 
to Palestine and leave Israel because when push came to shove, they 
know that their children would be a lot freer, get a lot better 
education, and be a lot more economically well off living in Israel 
than they would in Palestine.
  Palestine would probably become another State like Gaza, kind of a 
crooked State in which whatever leadership they vote for takes the 
foreign aid and keeps it.
  By the way, some of you older people--I don't know how old the Chair 
is--remember Yasser Arafat who many, many years ago was running Gaza.
  Apparently his ancestors now, they got out. They are living in Paris. 
They don't want to live in Gaza. They are living in Paris high on the 
hog with all the money that Yasser Arafat managed to make off the 
foreign aid the West was sending to Gaza.

                              {time}  1215

  In any event, I would ask the press to report a little bit about 
these land swaps--even that is kind of an old story--and in a new 
story, point out all the people from around the world who would like to 
live in Israel and replace the Palestinians who kicked away the great 
jobs that they had in Gaza, and particularly pay attention to what is 
going on in Ecuador and how many people from Ecuador are going to come 
halfway around the world to be grateful to have the jobs that the 
Palestinians kicked away who were living in Gaza at this time on the 
beautiful Mediterranean Sea.
  Now, the next thing I want to talk about, and I don't think has been 
adequately addressed, we reported on the tax bill yesterday. I am not 
sure you could call it a major bill. There were good things in the bill 
and bad things in the bill, as you can imagine, because it was part of 
negotiations between Republicans and Democrats.
  As I mentioned, the child tax credits probably have an element of 
welfare in them, which is bad. On the other hand, they did go to the 
middle class, which is one of the few things that we don't phase out 
and say because you are making $60,000 a year, we are going to take 
them away from you and punish you for working, or punish you for 
getting married.
  There was another provision in there that I really disliked, even 
though I voted for the bill, because overall, the positives outweighed 
the negatives, but it is a provision that was only in there because the 
press corps does not highlight it; that is, low-income housing tax 
credits. It is a little bit of a boring topic, but I ask the Chair to 
indulge me a little bit.
  There are a variety of ways in which the Federal Government--it is 
none of their business to do it, by the way--in which the Federal 
Government tries to provide low-income housing for people. One is by 
giving a low-income housing tax credit to property developers of low-
income housing.
  We tweaked that credit for only a 2-year period and only a certain 
subset of that credit yesterday in the bill. The press corps ought to 
talk a little bit about these credits, because I don't think that they 
would survive the light of day, or survive appropriate attention by the 
mainstream media.
  My problem with them is in addition to my problem with all Federal 
mucking around in low-income housing, particularly low-income housing 
that is not for the elderly. For the elderly, I guess I can say 
positive things for it. For the disabled, I can say positive things 
about it.
  The low-income housing tax credit means that when the Federal 
Government gets involved, a huge beneficiary is, quite frankly, well-
off property developers. So you understand what happens, when 
developers take advantage of low-income housing tax credits, they get a 
credit equal to 9 percent of the total cost for a 10-year period. 
Because there is a time value of money, it means that when they build 
low-income housing, the government pays for 70 percent.
  In other words, if I am a well-off property housing developer, the 
government gives me 70 percent of the cost of that building and I only 
have to put in 30 percent, at a minimum. There are, I am told, places 
around the country where the States and local governments give them 
further incentives.
  I think a lot of these people, by the way, make campaign 
contributions. I think they are politically well-connected, as you can 
imagine, to take advantage of such a generous credit.

[[Page H383]]

  In any event, it is a very complicated thing. You might say what 
happens if the property developer does not have income tax to offset 
with the credit. What happens is, then they sell the credits to 
somebody else, frequently banks. We not only have beneficiaries of what 
is supposed to help with the low-income people go to an incredibly 
generous subsidy to property developers, but banks are able to use the 
credit to show the FDIC, or whoever, the banking regulators, that they 
are socially conscious, so they get a little bit of a benefit there as 
well.
  There are some anecdotes I have heard about this--by the way, an 
accounting firm puts out an explanation of the tax credit. The tax 
credit by itself kind of makes your eyes glaze over. People wonder 
where paperwork comes from. The accounting firm that puts it out 
devotes 1,400 pages to an explanation for a credit. Even if there are 
other things you like, you should know if Congress is passing a program 
that takes 1,400 pages to explain, you know it is a bad program.
  I think, by the way, it is complicated on purpose so you confuse 
Congressmen into voting for it. Because the government, not surprising, 
is paying for 70 percent of the cost of that apartment, that apartment, 
in general, costs 30 percent more than an apartment would if it was 
built in the private sector without having the government muck around. 
Right off the bat, there is a big problem there.
  I know a property developer in Wisconsin who builds normal 
apartments, not aimed for low-income housing, not taking advantage of 
the generous credit. He tells me that the people with the low-income 
housing credit frequently outbid him for the land, because the 
government is paying for 70 percent of the cost. Think about that. If 
you want somebody to build apartments for the middle class, they can't 
get the prime location in town because the low-income credit is so 
generous that the person with the low-income housing will always outbid 
them.
  Another thing that happens when the government pays 70 percent of the 
cost of something, you have a nicer apartment--because after 20 years 
it is no longer low-income housing--a nicer apartment than people who 
don't have low-income housing have. I have heard that complaint. I have 
heard people looking for new apartments, and they find the nicest 
apartments in town they are not eligible for because they are the low-
income housing units. That is what happens when the government pays for 
70 percent of the cost of the unit. Not to mention, there is the 
possibility for crookedness there, because if the government is paying 
70 percent of the cost of anything, doesn't it encourage your 
subcontractors to jack up the prices because the government is paying 
for 70 percent? Of course it does.

  Now, this new increase in generosity in the low-income housing credit 
will expire in 2 years. They were able to get this thing through 
because naive people, first of all, thought it was the Federal 
Government's business to get involved at all, but nice people felt that 
the low-income housing tax credit benefited low-income people. They 
didn't realize it was a payoff to well-connected property developers.
  If the press corps would wake up and write articles about this 
program, it would not survive the next 3 or 4 years. The only reason 
this program, which I consider to be about the most questionable part 
of the Internal Revenue Code--the only reason this thing is able to 
survive is because the slumbering press corps does not report on it.
  Now, there are a lot of programs on it. I don't like to highlight one 
nonprofit, but the Cato Institute has a great expose about this program 
out there, if you want to find it on the internet. It is about 5 years 
old, but it is as accurate today as it was then. If you think the 
Internal Revenue Code is used by well-heeled people to get things in 
there, this is for you.
  I strongly encourage the press corps to pay attention to the low-
income housing tax credits. Like I said, it is a waste of taxpayer 
money. I am the type of Congressman who tries to look out for the 
average guy. These are provisions stuck in the Internal Revenue Code to 
benefit the well-off, the politically well-connected. Just because they 
put kind of a nice-sounding title to it, ``low-income housing tax 
credit,'' you think they are looking out for the poor. They are looking 
out for the well-heeled property developer. That is the second thing 
that our slumbering press corps should pay attention to.
  The third thing I want to talk about is an issue we have talked about 
many times before, but since I last addressed the Chair, we released 
the figures on the number of people coming across the border.
  Now, I had guessed the last time I was up here that for the first 
time ever we would have over 300,000 people a month crossing the 
border. I remind people that back in the days of President Trump, that 
number was, depending on the month, around 10,000 or 12,000. We have 
gone from 10,000 or 12,000 people a month crossing our border what I 
will call illegally--because I think they are asking for asylum they 
don't deserve--from 10,000 or 12,000 to--this is just shocking; 
whenever I look at it, I can't believe it--370,000. We have gone up 
about 30 times as many people crossing into the United States as we did 
3 years ago.
  The American public ought to be absolutely appalled. We have an 
administration with Joe Biden, who fumbles around and says: Well, I 
guess maybe we should do something about that. Maybe Congress should 
meet with me, and we should try to do something.
  The American public should know, the fact that we have gone up from 
12,000 to 370,000 has nothing to do with Congress; it is the inability 
of the Biden administration to want to enforce the law. This is 
something they want by design. Instead of 12,000 people coming here 
illegally every month, they want 370,000. If they went back to the 
policies of President Trump, the stay-in-Mexico situation, we would 
reduce this number by 85 percent.
  Now, it would still be over 50,000. We still have more work to do. It 
would still be a disaster. Just by the signing of a piece of paper, he 
could knock that 370,000 figure back down to 40,000 or 50,000.
  Pointing out other things that are going on that the mainstream media 
is not doing a very good job on. In the 370,000, there were about, one 
more time, 12,000 unaccompanied minors. There is another thing that has 
gone up exponentially under this administration.
  The mainstream media purports to care when families are separated. I 
will tell you, when you have 12,000 people cross the border without 
their parents, that is family separation. Those kids should be turned 
around and sent back to their parents or contact their parents. Now, we 
don't do anything like that at all. If the child shows up and they have 
got a piece of paper on their T-shirt that says ``deliver me to Uncle 
Joe in Portland, Oregon,'' we buy them the plane ticket, we deliver 
them to Uncle Joe. We don't do DNA testing to see if it really is Uncle 
Joe. It is a recipe for human trafficking when people want to take 
advantage of young children, but the press allows it to happen.
  Under President Trump, they screamed about family separation when it 
was only a very temporary thing for a very small number of kids. Now, 
you have 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 kids a month, no big deal. We don't 
talk about it.
  The next thing to remember is that even once these kids are placed 
with sponsors, the Biden administration does not follow up to see where 
they are. Estimates vary, but somehow, I think somewhere between 30,000 
and 80,000 kids we have lost track of. In other words, we have let 15-
year-olds, 14-year-olds, and 12-year-olds in the country, and after a 
few months, we don't even know where they are.
  I would strongly encourage the press corps to report on the volume of 
people who came here in December. Even I, as opposed to the Biden 
administration as anybody, was expecting that number to come in 
310,000, 320,000. Instead, it is 370,000. They blew away the old record 
by about 50,000, more than I ever would have dreamed.
  We have to remember, in addition to all the people coming into our 
country, changing our country, committing crimes in our country, in 
addition to that, we have a situation in which they are bringing drugs 
in the country. We have to remember that over 100,000 of our citizens 
are dying every year from illegal drug overdoses.
  I know there are some hardhearted people who say: They took the drugs

[[Page H384]]

themselves; we don't care. Apparently, the Biden administration is in 
that category, because they don't do much to stop it. You would think 
any normal President, just to save the 100,000 lives and prevent all of 
these drugs from coming into our country, would close the border on 
that alone. The press, again, does not report it.

                              {time}  1215

  I was old enough to remember the Vietnam war. In 12 years in the 
Vietnam war, 57,000 American troops died, and it was reported 
constantly and should have been reported constantly. That was news when 
our troops were dying in Vietnam, 57,000 over 12 years.
  Now, we have 108,000, every year, dying from illegal drug overdoses. 
It happens in county after county, and it is swept under the rug 
because the mainstream media doesn't want to embarrass the Biden 
administration, so we don't talk about 108,000 people a year dying.
  Of course, is there any effort made to close the border or any effort 
made to prevent it? No. No effort is made to prevent it.
  It is a story that every local newspaper in the country--they are 
easy to find--ought to be reporting, not only the number for America as 
a whole; they ought to be pointing out how many people died, say, in 
the State of Wisconsin, or whatever State their paper is sent. They 
should be reporting how many people are dying in the county.
  You will find out, I would think, for almost every county in the 
country, probably every county in the State, if you added up all the 
murders and all the car accidents together, the number of people who 
are dying of illegal drugs is way over that total. We put car accidents 
with fatalities in the paper all the time because it is a tragic thing; 
people like to read about it or want to be informed about it. We 
obviously put local murders in the paper all the time.
  There are 108,000 Americans dying every year with spouses, with 
parents, with children. Let's sweep it under the rug, says the 
mainstream media. I will tell you, if you put that in there, people 
would pay attention to those stories.
  The next issue that I don't think has been covered enough and I will 
talk about more next week, but we had one more committee hearing in my 
subcommittee on wokeness in the military.
  Our current General Brown, who was previously head of the Air Force 
and is now head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, prior to coming in the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly said he wanted to reduce the number of 
officers in the military from 67 percent White men down to 43 percent 
White men.
  I walk around my district, and I ask average people. I said: Do you 
know the most important member of the military in the country has said 
his public goal is to reduce the number of White officers in the 
military from 67 percent to 43 percent? Almost nobody knows. The rest 
of the people are shocked.
  I told this to a Vietnam veteran who fought in Vietnam. I thought he 
was going to break down and cry right there when he found out what was 
happening to our military. They have taken the single most important 
agency in the United States, and they run it like it is some stupid 
community college, where it doesn't matter who we promote, where we 
don't have to pay attention to merit. Who cares? I can go to a cocktail 
party and brag about how many Hispanics or how many Asians or how many 
Native Americans are in the military. I no longer brag about how good 
my military is or how strong it is. I brag about how diverse it is.
  The press does not know what is going on here. In my committee, there 
were inferences that we also were playing games with who gets into our 
military academies--West Point, Air Force Academy, Annapolis. I 
nominate those people, like all Congressmen do every year, but the 
testimony was they are putting a thumb on the scale as to who gets into 
them.
  It is just offensive. It mirrors what is going on in other parts of 
the country.
  They pay people $190,000 a year to be diversity experts, to say: Oh, 
this person is registered as this, this person is registered to that. I 
believe, when they do it, they do it like they do in the private sector 
and have been doing this for 50 years. You self-identify, so we keep 
this fiction going that, if you are one-quarter Peruvian, that you are 
a protected minority and you bring a diverse view of the world.
  I don't know why, if somebody has a grandmother who is Peruvian and 
grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland, you have a unique view of the world 
and it is important to give you preferences to get a promotion in the 
military, but that is apparently how we are operating right now. In any 
event, all of the American public should be aware of that.
  If our military is not number one in the world, we are going to be in 
big trouble, baby. One of the only reasons why we are number one in the 
world is because we do have the strongest military in the world, and to 
begin to say our promotions should no longer be based on merit but 
should be based on looking around and finding somebody from--I don't 
know--South Africa or whatever is preposterous.
  Now, I will remind the Chair one more time that we are adding a new 
minority group to be given preferences right now. President Biden wants 
North Africans and Middle Eastern people--people, if you draw a line 
from Morocco all the way to Iran, he wants them considered as a special 
group who is in need of protection, as well. This will mean that if 
somebody emigrates here from, say, Egypt, and President Biden gets what 
he wants, they will also be considered a special case, in need of 
special protection, and being given preference over the native born.
  It is so divisive. Not only do you not have the best people 
necessarily getting the job, but it is so divisive because you are 
teaching our military--rather than you are one, we are all one unit, we 
are all American, you are taking the military and saying: You should 
walk around with a chip on your shoulder. You are a Hispanic American, 
you are an African American, you are a Native American, you are an 
Asian American, you are a Middle Eastern American, and it is just the 
beginning of the end.
  I strongly hope, when we come to the appropriations bill--and we made 
some progress--not as much progress as we wanted in the authorizing 
bill, but I hope that our team, when it comes to the appropriations 
bill, removes all of these horrible DPI positions.

  Our military, a lot of people tell us it is underfunded. I am not 
sure that is true, but people tell us that. To pay 190 grand a year for 
these people is, quite frankly, ridiculous, and it is something that 
should be reported in the mainstream media.
  My fifth story that we are going to cover today that the mainstream 
media is not going to pay attention to is we had a prayer breakfast 
earlier this morning in the Capitol. In the past, we had that prayer 
breakfast outside the Capitol. We would take a bus a mile away or rent 
something in a hotel. Today, we did it right here in the Capitol, which 
is fine, saved a few bucks; that was good. President Biden came over, 
gave a little speech, which was good.
  In any event, the main speaker was the Chaplain of the Senate, and 
the Chaplain of the Senate was very animated, gave quite a long sermon. 
However, it was an interesting sermon, because I believe he called for 
a fast of all Americans of once or twice a week. It wasn't a full fast. 
I mean, you could drink water. The fast would end every day at 3 
o'clock.
  Nevertheless, I thought it was interesting that Reverend Black from 
the U.S. Senate, who claimed there are a lot of Senators or Members of 
the Senate--I think maybe he was mentioning staff, too--who fasted 
frequently. Of course, he quoted several Bible verses in both the Old 
and New Testament in which the Israelis fasted. Jesus' disciples, after 
he left, were going to fast.
  I thought it was interesting that we had such a student of the Bible, 
the Chaplain of the Senate, who has been here since 2003 that was 
calling for a fast.
  I think it is something interesting and ought to be in your local 
newspaper if you want to know what is going on around here. I mean, it 
was a prayer breakfast. A significant number of U.S. Senators and 
Congressmen attended. The President of the United States attended. 
Wouldn't you think they would cover it?
  I bet, if I look in the mainstream newspapers tomorrow--the 
Washington Post, the New York Times, et cetera,

[[Page H385]]

the Milwaukee Journal in my area--they will not cover the fact that the 
longtime Chaplain in the U.S. Senate called for a fast.
  So those are five stories that have been underreported. We will ask, 
if there are any members of the mainstream media that we see, whether 
their newspapers covered them. If the stories are even a little bit 
old, it doesn't mean they shouldn't be in there.
  To me, if you are a mainstream newspaper, a citizen who reads you 
every day should be informed, and every one of these five issues, I 
think somebody who reads the Washington Post; the Philadelphia 
Inquirer, if that is still around; the Milwaukee Journal, would not 
know these five issues.
  I am going to go through them again:
  The degree to which people all around the world are looking to 
replace these Palestinians as far as doing work in Israel.
  The horribleness, the waste of the low-income housing tax credits 
which would not survive the mainstream media paying attention to it.
  What is going on at the border, the degree to which, in December, we 
just blew away any previous totals of people coming across there, and 
the degree that we have to do something.
  The wokeness in the military--that is the fourth issue--the degree to 
which the current head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is overtly saying 
that he does not want the best people running the military if they 
happen to be White.
  Also, that the Chaplain of the Senate was such a Bible-believing guy 
that he called on the Congressmen and Senators who were there today to 
begin to fast, and he actually told us that a lot of the U.S. Senators 
are already fasting.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

     units and Israel is a piercing global tragedy. It demands a 
     global response. Yet, ``Peace and Justice'' have eluded 
     solution in this troubled region for over a century. It will 
     be even harder to achieve after this conflagration ends. The 
     extraordinary death toll will resound for generations 
     forward. How does one create a lasting peace borne of such 
     fierce, enduring hatreds?
       The invasion Hamas' fighters launched from Palestinian Gaza 
     into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 broke the cease-fire that had 
     tensely hung over that very troubled region. More than 1,200 
     innocent Israeli civilians were slaughtered in a barbaric 
     attack, with more than 100 Israeli and some American hostages 
     still remaining in captivity. More than 250,000 Israelis were 
     evacuated and displaced from their homes. In Gaza, 1.7 
     million Gazans have subsequently been displaced with Hamas 
     health officials claiming more than 25,000 civilians dead, 
     and more than 60,000 injured with two-thirds of the victims 
     being women and children.
       How does any army defeat a hostile enemy positioned amidst 
     a civilian population and underground in a vast ``bunker 
     city'' with miles of interconnected tunnels, dug for purposes 
     of war, not peace?
       Over 140,000 Hezbollah terrorist forces supplied by Iran, 
     are positioned in southern Lebanon, shooting rockets down on 
     Israel now. It is no accident Yemen's terrorist Houthi

[[Page H488]]

     adherents, also supplied by Iran, have been purposefully 
     shelling private cargo ships as well as targeting U.S. naval 
     vessels in the Red Sea to disrupt global trade in this 
     conflicted region. Russia's role in exacerbating resurgent 
     unrest was made clear when top Gen. Sergei Shoigu recently 
     visited Iran. And a Hamas delegation was in Moscow not long 
     after it attacked Israel.
       Across the Middle East, a spiderweb of terrorism is 
     hastening, hell-bent on evil. Iranian drones and missiles are 
     being used against Ukraine, Israel, the United States, and 
     our allies in Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, and Jordan. North Korean 
     missiles are likewise in use against Ukraine. The global 
     distinction between tyranny and liberty could not be clearer. 
     The world community of nations must not allow terrorist 
     forces enabled by Iran and Russia to foment unrest and 
     carnage. The sacred boundaries of nations must be respected, 
     defended, and enforced.
       The history of the Middle East instructs that former 
     adversarial nations can make peace among themselves. For 
     nearly five decades, dating back to my days of service in the 
     Carter administration, proposals for a two-State solution 
     have been advanced for Israel and Palestine.
       Ironically, the depth and brutality of this present 
     conflict may create an opening for a far-reaching solution. 
     If the world community could spend as much money on peace as 
     it has on war, both the Israelis and Palestinians could have 
     thriving homelands.
       To move forward, I propose that the United Nations, or a 
     coalition of willing nations, begin to negotiate a ``Gaza-
     Palestinian Protectorate.'' The parties involved should aim 
     to negotiate a long-lasting solution to the conflict in Gaza, 
     address challenges in the West Bank, and divide the contested 
     territory securing their existence with an International 
     Multilateral Security Force to separate warring factions.
       If the civilized world could achieve this with a divided 
     Korea, why not with Palestine and Israel?
       The goals of the Protectorate would be fourfold:
       (1) an international coalition of nations should be 
     assembled and involved in organizing its administration and 
     staffing;
       (2) Gaza would be demilitarized of weapons, war, tunnels, 
     and fortifications;
       (3) Hamas would have no role, politically, 
     administratively, or economically;
       (4) Palestinians from Gaza should be involved in the 
     administration of the Protectorate's on-site operations, 
     including its police forces.
       The Protectorate would have three immediate tasks. The 
     first would be to quickly secure resources and provide food, 
     water, shelter, and medical care to the almost 2.3 million 
     people of Gaza.
       The second is to provide an international military 
     coalition that can demilitarize Gaza as quickly as possible. 
     Gaza must never again be a threat to its neighbors.
       The third is to physically separate Gaza and Israel, by 
     creating a demilitarized zone between the two, that is 
     virtually impenetrable, as is the DMZ between North and South 
     Korea. As part of the separation, the infrastructure to 
     provide water, sewage treatment, and energy needed by Gaza 
     should be located in Gaza and staffed by the people of Gaza.
       One of the long-term missions could be to rebuild what is 
     now a destroyed area under a new vision of peace and 
     prosperity. Gaza has many undeveloped resources, the primary 
     of which is its land and location. While small in size, Gaza 
     is located in one of the most attractive parts of the 
     Mediterranean, with miles of undeveloped, beautiful beaches 
     that could become a recreational center of the region.
       With peace and stability, Gaza could become a financial and 
     economic hub that attracts capital and businesses from around 
     the world. Gaza and the West Bank have the thousands of 
     workers needed to rebuild what has been destroyed along with 
     necessary staff to renew the economy. A ``Gaza Development 
     Authority'' as part of the Protectorate could create and 
     administer a long-term development plan to bring prosperity 
     and transparency that would forestall the corruption that so 
     often accompanies unfettered development.
       Hope must arise from this cruel war. Old diplomacy, and old 
     solutions should be shelved. They should be replaced with a 
     forward-looking approach that could bring peace, justice, and 
     prosperity to this war-torn region. Succeeding would give 
     hope to a civilized world that hungers for peace in these 
     troubled lands."

Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 815, 
which the clerk will report.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 30, H.R. 815, to amend 
     title 38, United States Code, to make certain improvements 
     relating to the eligibility of veterans to receive

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.


                          Supplemental Funding

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be brief.
  Yesterday, the Senate cleared the first major procedural hurdle to 
passing the national security supplemental. It was a good and very 
important first step. We now resume postcloture debate on the motion to 
proceed. If we don't reach a time agreement, we will hold the next vote 
on the motion to proceed at approximately 7 p.m. tonight, but I hope 
our Republican colleagues can work with us to reach an agreement on 
amendments so we can move this process along. Democrats are willing to 
consider reasonable and fair amendments here on the floor as we have 
shown on many occasions in the past 3 years. Nevertheless, the Senate 
will keep working on this bill until the job is done.
  I yield the floor.


                   Recognition of the Minority Leader

  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is 
recognized.


                          Supplemental Funding

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when the Biden administration released 
its request for supplemental appropriations in October, I said the 
Senate would need to do its own work to meet the demonstrated needs of 
our national security.
  The President's decisions over the past 3 years have directly 
contributed to the web of serious security challenges demanding the 
Senate's attention--from an embarrassing retreat from Afghanistan that 
emboldened terrorists and shredded credibility with our allies, to a 
halting response to Russian escalation that kept lethal capabilities 
off the frontlines of Ukraine's defense, to an Iran policy that tried 
trading deterrence for detente.
  The Senate can and will continue to urge the Commander in Chief to do 
the right thing, but we also have a responsibility of our own to 
provide for the common defense and equip the next Commander in Chief 
with the tools to exercise American strength.

[[Page S566]]

  That responsibility is in front of us right now, and addressing 
national security challenges with serious legislation starts with 
recognizing some pretty basic realities about how the world works:
  First, America has global interests and global responsibilities, and 
to the extent the President has neglected them, the Senate ignores them 
at the Nation's peril.
  Second, alliances and partnerships are essential to advancing our 
interests. They lower the costs of keeping the peace, reduce the direct 
risks to America, and facilitate the commerce that drives our economy. 
But these alliances and partnerships rely on American leadership and 
American credibility.
  Finally, there is a growing list of adversaries who wish us harm. 
There is growing evidence that they are working together, and there is 
no doubt that they are emboldened by American weakness.
  These are not opinions. They are plainly observable facts borne out 
by history. Denying them does a disservice to the American people, and 
it is impossible to engage productively on decisions about U.S. 
national security without acknowledging them.
  So a great number of our colleagues have worked diligently on 
legislation that confronts Russian aggression against the West, Iran-
backed terror against Israel and U.S. forces, and the rise of an 
aggressive China head-on. The product before the Senate resolves the 
significant shortcomings of the President's request.
  For example, thanks to Senate Republicans, it requires the Commander 
in Chief to submit a strategy that identifies the specific objectives, 
requirements, and metrics from our assistance to Ukraine. It shifts $4 
billion away from direct budget support to Kyiv into security 
investments instead. And it fully funds the special inspector general 
for Ukraine created by the NDAA last year, further expanding already 
unprecedented visibility into how U.S. assistance is actually being 
used.
  The legislation also designates $9 billion above the President's 
request for U.S. defense needs, including $2.4 billion for ongoing 
operations against Iran-backed terrorists in the Middle East. And, 
thanks to Republican efforts, it imposes strict new oversight measures 
on humanitarian assistance and ensures that not a single penny of U.S. 
taxpayer funds goes to the U.N. agency whose employees stoke hatred in 
Gaza and actually participated in the slaughter of Jews in Israel.
  Underneath these essential provisions sit historic and urgent 
investments in American hard power, which is critical to our national 
defense.
  Our allies and partners in Ukraine and Israel are fighting our shared 
adversaries, degrading their military capacity, and working to restore 
deterrence. Our friends in the Pacific are working to deter yet another 
one.
  Together, they are facing the raw end of authoritarian aggression and 
terrorist savagery. Our colleagues have heard me say this before: 
American assistance to these efforts is not charity. It is an 
investment in cold, hard U.S. interests.
  This is not a rhetorical device. It is not referring to some vague 
lines of efforts from which America expects to receive some trickle-
down benefit. I mean quite literally spending tens of billions of 
dollars here in America, upgrading our capabilities, creating American 
manufacturing jobs, and expanding our defense industrial capacity to 
help us better compete with advanced adversaries.
  Of just the funds this supplemental designates to support Ukrainian's 
defense, $19.85 billion of it will be spent right here in America on 
replenishing our own arsenal. Another $3.5 billion will be spent--
again, here in America--to expand our industrial base's capacity to 
produce artillery and air-defense and long-range weapons. And $15.4 
billion will be spent--one more time, here in America--on weapons for 
Ukraine to continue degrading the military strength of a major U.S. 
adversary.
  These investments create capacity that we, the United States, need 
for serious competition with our adversaries.
  Of course, this doesn't even account for the massive streams of 
funding our allies and partners around the world are investing in 
American capabilities themselves, including more than $120 billion and 
counting from NATO allies.
  Overall, even accounting for direct assistance sent to allies like 
Israel, more than 75 percent of this legislation is bound for 
investments right here in America, and more than 60 percent of it goes 
to the defense industrial base, where increasing capacity is a direct 
investment in long-term strength abroad and prosperity here at home.
  This is about rebuilding the arsenal of democracy and demonstrating 
to our allies and adversaries alike that we are serious about 
exercising American strength.
  I can present these facts as frequently as necessary. It is what I 
have been doing quite literally for years.
  Every one of our colleagues is capable of understanding that security 
assistance appropriated in support of Ukraine is money invested right 
here in America. Every one of our colleagues is capable of 
understanding that the investments this legislation makes in expanding 
production capacity--from artillery rounds to rocket motors, to 
submarines--are investments in readiness for long-term competition with 
China, a competition America cannot afford to lose.
  Every single one of us knows what is at stake here, and it is time 
for every one of us to deal with it head-on.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset that I thank the 
Senator from Kentucky for his words on the floor in support of 
assistance to Ukraine in its hour of need. I thank him for being 
consistent in that message.
  Yesterday, after months of delay, 17 Republican Senators joined in a 
bipartisan effort to advance critical security and humanitarian aid. I 
want to thank them for stepping up and urge them to continue moving 
this bill to final passage and moving it to passage in the House of 
Representatives.
  All the while, while we were giving our speeches here on the floor of 
the Senate and other places, Vladimir Putin has been sitting back and 
waiting for the United States to finally walk away from the Ukrainians, 
as they fight bravely to repel his bloody onslaught. Putin is hoping 
that Donald Trump will be reelected and that this Congress will 
discontinue aid to Ukraine. Meanwhile, the ``message man'' for the MAGA 
movement, Tucker Carlson, was in Moscow interviewing the former 
communist KGB agent Vladimir Putin, hoping, no doubt, to further his 
cynical strategy.
  Is there anyone here who could remotely have imagined that many in 
the party of Ronald Reagan and John McCain would be actively voting 
against aid to stop Russian tyranny, that they would bend to the will 
of former President Trump, who has spoken favorably of the Russian 
despot?
  This photograph captures a moment a few years ago. It captures a 
moment, 37 years ago, at the Brandenburg Gate, between East and West 
Germany, where President Reagan stood resolutely for freedom and told 
Gorbachev to tear down the wall.
  This second photograph is more personal to me. About 10 years ago, 
when Senator John McCain and I were part of a delegation that 
represented colleagues from Arizona, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and 
Wyoming, we went to Ukraine's Maidan Square in Kyiv to honor those who 
had been killed in the fight for freedom.
  I am not alone in asking the same question that was asked yesterday 
by the Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk. He said, ``Ronald Reagan, 
who helped millions of us win back our freedom and independence, must 
be turning [over] in his grave'' with what is happening now in 
Washington.
  The Polish people are staunch allies of Ukraine and the United 
States, and they have long memories of Soviet tyranny. They know that 
critical American resolve is part of overcoming that tyranny, and we 
should never forget it.
  I am proud to represent the city of Chicago and the State of 
Illinois. There are many Polish Americans there--great people. I think 
what they have done during this Ukrainian war is an amazing story. They 
have literally embraced the refugees from Ukraine. As one of the Polish 
officials told me: Senator, you won't find a refugee camp for 
Ukrainians in Poland. We bring them into our homes.
  It is an amazing outpouring. When you ask them, what is motivating 
you?

[[Page S567]]

  He said: We remembered no one would do that for us when we faced the 
same tyranny in our own history.
  They have made a difference. It is not just because of their love for 
their neighbors in Ukraine, but it is also the realization that, if 
Vladimir Putin conquers Ukraine, the next target could easily be Poland 
or the Baltic nations. They know that this fight, which is being waged 
against Putin in Ukraine, is their fight. We should realize the same.
  Next week, a bipartisan group of us are attending the Munich Security 
Conference. It is an annual conference in Germany where we bring 
together the European nations and many others to discuss topics of the 
day. You can bet the No. 1 topic will be Ukraine. God forbid we fail to 
pass this defense supplemental before the Munich Conference. I don't 
know what I will say to our friends and allies in NATO and in Europe 
who stood by us and by the Ukrainian people for so long if we abandon 
them here in the U.S. Senate.
  The first question that they will ask is, Will we approve the money 
necessary to buy the ammunition and equipment for the Ukrainians to 
fight on? We are going to answer that question here in the U.S. Senate 
in just a matter of hours.
  NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg recently said that if Putin isn't 
stopped, he will continue his war beyond Ukraine, with grave 
consequences.
  And make no mistake, it is not only Putin watching and savoring our 
failure to act. It is Iran, China, North Korea, and many others.
  So let's get this done. Let's show Putin and the other tyrants of the 
world that they cannot divide and weaken us at home or with our allies 
abroad.
  For months, my Republican colleagues refused to provide critical aid 
to Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, and Taiwan and to address urgent national 
security and humanitarian needs until we would consider and pass 
legislation to secure the American border. This week, we had an 
opportunity to vote on a bipartisan bill that would help us to secure 
the border and provide this essential national security funding. I had 
some concerns about the language in this, but I realized it was a 
bipartisan compromise.
  Senator James Lankford, speaking for the Republicans, had been 
negotiating literally for weeks to get the right language that could 
appeal to both Democrats and Republicans.
  I want to thank Senator Murphy and Senator Kyrsten Sinema for their 
resolve as well.
  While I had some concerns about the proposal, as I said, I was 
prepared to support it with some changes. I am happy to report that it 
received the support of the National Border Patrol Council, the union 
that represents Border Patrol agents.
  Despite all of this, Senate Republicans said they wanted to offer 
amendments. Well, the way to offer an amendment is, first, to pass a 
motion to proceed to the bill. When that measure came up for support, 
we didn't have enough Republican support to pass it on the floor. 
Almost immediately after the bill was released, numerous Senate 
Republicans had come out in opposition to it.
  And when the bill came to floor, they voted not to even consider it. 
Why? Why? Because Donald Trump told them not to. And he was very bold 
about it. He said: Blame me, if you will. But any attempt to make 
border security changes should be stopped now so he can use the issue 
in the campaign. He said: ``Blame it on me'' if the bill fails.
  Well, we will. Trump is apparently fearful that a bipartisan effort 
to secure the border would undermine his campaign rhetoric.
  His interference could not have come at a worse time. We are facing 
the worst refugee crisis in modern history. With outdated laws and 
underfunded agencies, our immigration system is not up to the 
challenge. As a result, many migrants are stuck in our processing 
backlogs for years, without a work permit.
  Most people don't know this fact, but I want to make it for the 
record. We have had about 36,000 migrants come into the city of 
Chicago, primarily from Texas. They were sent there under false 
pretenses that there were accommodations waiting and a job waiting for 
them. That was not the case. But the Governor of Texas didn't care, and 
he didn't care about their outcome and their plight--36,000, trying to 
find shelter for them. Some went to police stations and slept on the 
floor. Some slept in churches. The Catholic charities did an amazing 
job, as well as many others, to try to take care of them. And it has 
been a real hardship on the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois--
36,000 people.
  There is one thing most people don't realize. In the past year and a 
half, we have absorbed, in Chicago, 30,000 Ukrainian immigrants who 
have come from war-torn Ukraine to the city of Chicago.
  Now, I hope you can understand that a city that has a section known 
as Ukrainian Village certainly welcomes these people. Families that 
sponsor them said that they would stand by them. And they became part 
of our society and part of our economy quickly, without a lot of rancor 
and with the understanding of people that they were going to add to 
America. And they were in desperate need.
  So 30,000 Ukrainians were absorbed into Chicago without much fanfare. 
I have seen them at the churches and their schools, working in 
restaurants, doing the kind of work that immigrants are used to doing 
in America.
  But the 36,000 who came in as migrants from Texas were sent in by the 
busload, without any warning and without any effort to try to 
assimilate them into the area before they arrived. The difference is 
very stark.
  The legislation that we were going to consider before the Republicans 
killed it would have created a new system to process migrants quickly. 
It would have funded our frontline officials and immigration officers 
with $20 billion to ensure that they are processed efficiently.
  Think about that. The Republicans have been saying publicly for 
months that we need more resources at the border to stop the onslaught 
of people who are arriving. And they also believe--and I share the 
belief--that we need more surveillance at the border, not only for 
those coming across the border but also for those bringing across the 
border narcotics and other contraband dangerous to America.
  So the bill, which they stopped this week with their vote on the 
floor, would have provided $20 billion to ensure that they would be 
processed efficiently at the border and provide $20 billion, at least, 
in new technology and resources to stop the onslaught of narcotics and 
drugs.
  It would have ensured that asylum seekers with legitimate claims can 
get a work permit quickly and start working, as so many businesses 
across the Nation need.
  Despite my concerns about this legislation, because it left out 
Dreamers, I was prepared to consider it and support it. The DREAM Act 
was a measure that I introduced some 22 years ago in an effort to give 
these young people, who were brought to this country by their parents 
and who grew up here and became part of America, a chance to finally 
prove themselves and earn their way into citizenship. I think it should 
be included in any measure that addresses immigration from this point 
forward.
  I hope we can all agree on one thing: We need to work together in a 
bipartisan way to secure the border, after years of congressional 
failure. Bipartisanship requires compromise.
  After all of the Senate Republicans' TV appearances, campaign photos 
at the border, and impassioned speeches on the floor, it only took one 
man to destroy this agreement, this hard-fought bipartisan agreement--
Donald Trump.
  I know my Republican colleagues understand the urgent need to secure 
the border. I am disappointed that they would let their fear of one man 
stop this body from doing its job.
  We still have a chance to do the right thing when it comes to 
security. We can stand behind the people in Ukraine who are fighting 
bravely every single day.
  I cannot imagine how America can explain to the world why it would 
walk away from this battle against Vladimir Putin. We know his 
ambitions beyond Ukraine are terrible, and innocent people will suffer. 
Let's let the Ukrainian soldiers fight bravely with our support with a 
vote in the Senate today.
  I yield the floor.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.

[[Page S568]]

  

  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I don't need to tell the people in this 
body or on the other side of the Capitol that the public view of 
Washington, DC, is not very good. Our numbers in public opinion numbers 
oftentimes are in the single digits, and they are there for good 
reason. They are there because oftentimes people only see politics here 
all the time. They see bodies and individuals who work for the parties; 
they don't work for the good of America.
  What we saw earlier this week just confirms that, where we had a bill 
that came out to address border security--particularly on the southern 
border, but it does good things for the northern border too. It 
addresses border security in this country, where we are seeing people 
coming across the border--the southern border in particular. We don't 
know who they are, and it is just flat a national security issue.
  When I go home to Montana, I hear it from everybody. I hear it from 
families, from business owners, from policemen to mayors--you name it. 
In Montana--and I don't think Montana is different from any other 
State--this is a big issue. People understand the southern border is 
broken, and they want us, the folks who serve in Washington, DC, their 
representatives to the government, to do something about it.
  Over the last many years, multiple administrations, we have seen 
people go to the border and talk about how things are really bad down 
there: They are bad because we have undocumented folks coming across 
the border in record numbers. They are bad because we have fentanyl 
coming into this country that is killing people and ruining families.
  Then they come back and go around the country talking about how 
miserably bad it is on the southern border and how it needs to be 
fixed. They are right.
  Unfortunately--this shouldn't be about press releases and emails and 
newsletters and interviews at night; this should be about getting 
something done to fix the problem.
  So what transpired about 4 months ago is that we had a bill on the 
floor then--funding for Ukraine. I believe there was funding for 
Israel, and I believe there was funding for the Indo-Pacific. There 
were some in this body who said: This bill is going nowhere until we 
get something that addresses the problems at the southern border.
  I was standing right over there when one of the Senators said: We get 
southern border--Republicans; Democrats get Ukraine funding.
  Well, he was wrong. The truth is, the United States gets southern 
border protection, and U.S. citizens get to help Ukraine and support 
democracy and make sure that Putin isn't successful in taking over 
Ukraine and ultimately the rest of the Europe.
  But nonetheless, there are three people who went out. They were given 
the blessing to negotiate a bipartisan--which is the way things should 
be done around here and are done around here--a bipartisan southern 
border bill. The two people, the Republican and the Democrat or the 
Democrat and the Republican--however you want to place it--happen to be 
the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Appropriations 
Subcommittee. The other was a Member who is an Independent who lives in 
a State that borders the southern border, Arizona.
  So these folks went down and they worked and worked and worked. I 
have been part of these negotiations. Quite frankly, they are never 
easy. Nobody gets everything they want. There is compromise. There are 
negotiations. In the end, you thread the needle, and you come up with a 
bill that actually secures the southern border, that, by the way, any 
one of those three negotiators would tell you they would not have 
written themselves, but through the negotiating process, they came up 
with a bill.
  I am going to tell you, it was a pretty darn good bill. They rolled 
it out last Sunday night for all of us to see, some 300-plus pages. I 
got to read that bill. But the interesting thing is, before the bill 
was even rolled out, some of the folks who serve in this body said ``I 
oppose it.'' Before they even had a chance to look at it, they said ``I 
oppose it'' because they were told to oppose the bill.
  Now, look, we are all elected by our citizens in our States to come 
here. I would hope we all have a mind, I would hope we all can think, 
and I would hope we could all discern fact from fiction. But when 
somebody says ``Vote against it'' and you just vote against it after 
you have been in your State--you have heard what a big issue this is, 
and you have considered what can happen if we do nothing versus what 
could happen if we do something. Yet, for political purposes--not 
because it is bad policy but for political purposes--a person says 
``Don't fix it,'' and, almost like a cult, people here said ``We are 
voting no.'' Many of them have not read it.
  It is unbelievable to me. I have seen a lot of hypocrisy in this 
place, but it is unbelievable to me the hypocrisy in that vote, as a 
condition of national security--and folks in this body turn their backs 
on fixing the problem. Why? Because they want to keep it a political 
issue, which is exactly why the people look at Washington, DC, and say: 
Do you know what? Those folks don't represent us. They are in it for 
themselves. They just want everything to be an upheaval.
  It confirms that thought.
  So what does the bill do? What does this compromise bill do for 
America? It funds $20 billion in security for the southern border--for 
manpower, for technology, and to attack the fentanyl crisis, which is a 
scourge on this country. It includes the FEND Off Fentanyl Act, which 
puts serious harm to China's wallet for putting the precursor elements 
of fentanyl into Mexico.
  It changes the asylum laws. It raises the bar--exponentially--and 
stops folks who come to the border illegally from gaming the system.
  It requires--it requires--the President to shut down the border when 
they can't handle the people. Look, don't take my word for it. The 
National Border Patrol Council, some 18,000 Border Patrol agents have 
endorsed this bill. These are the folks that are charged, by the way, 
with keeping our border safe.
  The acting director of Customs and Border Protection endorsed this 
bill and said it ``would provide the strongest set of tools we have had 
in decades.'' The chief of the U.S. Border Patrol said on FOX News that 
``this bill that would have added additional hundreds of border patrol 
agents to our rank and file, that would have given us more technology, 
would have given us more equipment infrastructure. Of course I'm going 
to be supportive of that.''
  And one of the Senators that negotiated this bill--a strong 
conservative I might add--Republican Senator James Lankford from 
Oklahoma said that this would have stopped 800,000 entries in the past 
4 months if it had already been signed into law.
  The hypocrisy is stunning. Senators and House Members, who went back 
to their home States and talked about how bad the southern border was 
and how we needed to act, now have flip-flopped.
  These are politicians who claim to work bipartisanly, but they oppose 
bipartisan solutions. They are the same ones who have cried loudly for 
years that we need changes--policy changes--on the border, but they are 
revealing in plain sight that it isn't about policy issues; it is about 
politics.
  And the disinformation campaign that has come along with this is 
rich. Claims that 5,000 migrants would be allowed into this country 
every day is patently false; and if they had read the bill, they would 
have known it.
  There are those who say that Congressional action isn't needed. That 
also is false. We control the purse strings; we control the policy 
language. And only Congress can fix our asylum laws; only Congress can 
make sure we are giving the Border Patrol the resources that they need 
to secure the border.
  I wish this place worked; I really do. This is the greatest country 
in the world--not by accident, because our forefathers acted 
responsibly that we didn't have campaign seasons that never end; that 
we could actually sit down and negotiate, not as Democrats and 
Republicans but as Americans, to do what is right for this country.
  If we don't start acting like adults in this place and start thinking 
and acting reasonably and listening to our constituents--not listening 
to one person but listen to the folks that sent you here; even when you 
disagree with them, you should be listening to them--to try to fix the 
problems, I fear for this country's future. And I don't say that 
lightly.

[[Page S569]]

  There is plenty of evidence out there that shows that China would 
love to replace us as the premier economy and the premier military in 
this world. That is not something that we should take lightly. That is 
something that we should take very, very seriously.
  And when Congress doesn't do their job, when Congress doesn't even 
debate a bill to deal with a serious problem in this country, it does 
not speak well of us, and it only empowers our opponents out there, the 
countries that want to replace us in the world.
  I don't know what will transpire with this negotiated border 
agreement, but I do hope that we get another opportunity to vote on it, 
on the policy that was negotiated by Lankford and Sinema and Murphy. 
They worked hard. At a bare minimum, they deserve--they deserve--but 
more importantly, the American people deserve--to hear a debate on this 
bill and find out not what Facebook or Twitter or what the internet 
says about this bill but find out exactly what is in this bill.
  Because I can tell you Montanans are tired of DC political games and, 
quite frankly, so am I.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kelly). The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.


                            Child Tax Credit

  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have an opportunity. We have an 
opportunity to come together to cut taxes for American families in my 
State and for the families of more than 500,000 children, and to cut 
taxes for American manufacturers.
  The deal negotiated by Finance Chairman Wyden, a Democrat, in the 
Senate and Ways and Means Chairman Smith in the House, a Republican, 
along with their colleagues of both parties, has overwhelming 
bipartisan support. It passed the committee in the House 40 to 3. It 
passed on the House floor with 357 votes.
  When does that happen here? It is how Congress is supposed to work.
  We talk with the people with whom we serve. We hear their concerns, 
and we act. Families are dealing with costs that are far too high 
because corporations continue to raise prices to pay for executive 
bonuses and stock buybacks and higher profit margins.
  I often think of this, because I hear, when my wife and I are at the 
grocery store near our church in Brecksville, when I am out talking to 
people at a roundtable, or just at an airport, people talk about high 
food prices. One of the reasons--the biggest reason--when people go to 
the grocery store, they realize they are paying for stock buybacks and 
executive bonuses.
  The American manufacturers have been telling us they can't compete 
with countries like China without more investment in research and 
development, but expiring provisions mean the Tax Code isn't rewarding 
that kind of investment as much as it should.
  I heard in Ohio from people in East Palestine. I am going for, I 
believe, the ninth time there next week. They are worried. This is the 
place, the community in Ohio on the Pennsylvania border in eastern 
Ohio, where the Norfolk Southern train derailed, causing all kinds of 
hardship for people. But people in East Palestine are worried, they 
tell me, that they can be hit by a surprise tax bill for the payments 
they rightly received from Norfolk Southern after the derailment last 
year. It is unacceptable. People in East Palestine have endured enough.
  So we came together to write a bipartisan, consensus bill that does 
all of those things. At a time when Washington seems pretty broken, we 
have an opportunity to come together and show the American people we 
can get things done. We can cut their taxes, we can support their 
businesses, we can help keep intellectual property in this country, we 
can help create jobs, and we can help families.
  The expansion of the child tax credit will help Ohio working families 
keep up with rising costs, including all the extra expenses that come 
with raising kids. It has broad support. Everyone--from the Nuns on the 
Bus to the National Association of Evangelicals--supports expanding the 
child tax credit.
  I know the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Arizona, and I have 
talked about how important the child tax credit is.
  It supports work. The nonpartisan scorekeepers at the Joint Committee 
on Taxation confirmed that this bill won't reduce work.
  When I hear from Ohio parents, the No. 1 thing they say they use 
their tax cut for is childcare, so they can work. We know how expensive 
childcare is.
  Also, when we passed this child tax credit--it is a tax cut for 
working families, where 90 percent of children and the families of 2 
million children in my State benefited from it. We passed it 3 or 4 
years ago, and it expired, unfortunately. But I got letters from 
families all the time saying: Now my daughter can play soccer, and we 
can afford the school fees. Now my son can be in a school play and 
afford the fees. Now we can maybe go to a movie once a month. These are 
all the kinds of things that families living on the edge or families 
not quite living on the edge contend with. It gives them that.
  It is key for Ohio manufacturers that invest in research and 
innovation. It is expensive. It is vital for keeping up with global 
competitors. These tax credits will allow Ohio companies to compete.
  Last month, I did a news conference with two longtime friends of 
mine, two former Ohio Republican Congressmen, Steve Stivers and Pat 
Tiberi. Steve Stivers is now president and CEO of the Ohio Chamber of 
Commerce and Pat Tiberi is now CEO of the Ohio Business Roundtable. 
They both talked about how crucial these tax cuts are for Ohio 
businesses.
  They are a major priority for American companies, as my Republican 
colleagues in the Senate have made clear to us all year. That is why 
Chairman Wyden and many of us worked with Republicans to write a bill 
that is a win-win for everybody. It is a true bipartisan process from 
the start. It includes ideas that have support from both parties.
  Take the lookback provision in the child tax credit, allowing parents 
to use the previous year's income to make sure they get the maximum 
possible tax cut. This is an idea that Senator Cassidy from Louisiana 
and I worked on together during the pandemic. We got support from both 
parties. This will make this bill work better. It will enable this bill 
to help children and families more. It is the same option that 
corporations have in the Tax Code. Why not make it available to 
families? Corporations often do lookbacks to look at the year before in 
calculating their taxes. Why wouldn't we make it available to families 
too?
  The way Chairman Wyden and Chairman Smith negotiated this bill is how 
we should do this. We listen to the people we serve.
  I know that Chairman Wyden spoke with a number of Republican members 
on the Finance Committee. He spoke with me often during this process as 
we worked on both the R&D tax credit and the child tax credit.
  I know that Chair Smith worked with members of both parties on his 
committee. That is why he passed it out of his committee 40 to 3. 
Imagine 40 to 3 on a tax bill in a Congress that has difficulty getting 
a consensus and getting things done.
  We made sure Members of both parties were in the room in these 
negotiations or were in the room in terms of having discussions. We got 
something done that brought people together. It supports families. It 
supports businesses. It includes priorities of both parties. It 
supports work. It supports American innovation. It won't add to the 
deficit. It is paid for by cracking down on fraud. There is no reason 
not to pass this deal.
  I mean, again, 357 votes in the House, overwhelming bipartisan 
support in the committee, then in the House--there is no reason to wait 
other than playing politics. We see it far too often here.
  We need to move. Tax season is underway. Families and businesses need 
these tax cuts now. Why would we walk away from a bipartisan bill that 
we could pass today if Members would put aside egos and politics and 
all that too often gets in the way. Let's come together to cut taxes 
for working families and cut taxes for Ohio manufacturers.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

[[Page S570]]

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Smith). Without objection, it is so 
ordered.


                            Border Security

  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, the Senate will be in session this 
weekend--including Super Bowl Sunday, which is fine by me--to deal with 
this bill that now, as everyone knows, is about Ukraine, funding for 
Ukraine and its war effort, funding for Israel, funding for Taiwan, and 
some other matters.
  I will dispense with the Israel and Taiwan funding because that is a 
pretty straightforward one that I think has very strong support here. I 
am for it. I am also for helping Ukraine against Russia. I do believe 
we have a national interest in helping Ukraine against Russia.
  I would just summarize it this way: If you look at China, which most 
people would agree is the U.S.'s biggest adversary at this point for 
global influence, the Chinese are hoping one of two things is going to 
happen. The first is, they are hoping that we are going to get stuck in 
Ukraine, along with what is happening in the Middle East, and that we 
are going to be drained by it and we won't be able to focus on the 
Indo-Pacific. But if we do become disengaged, then what their hope is--
they will go around telling people: See, we told you America is 
unreliable and a power in decline. So I believe our goal when it comes 
to Ukraine is to be helpful to Ukraine in a way that doesn't drain us, 
in a way that doesn't harm our alliances around the world.
  I have my own personal views on this. I have shared it in the past. I 
have had further confirmation of it over the last 24 hours--that where 
I think Ukraine eventually winds up is, I don't believe the Russians 
can ever achieve their initial objectives no matter what happens, which 
is to take all of Ukraine, all the way to Kyiv. I also think it is 
going to be very difficult for a country the size of Ukraine, no matter 
how much help it gets, to completely destroy the Russian Federation, 
which, no matter how bad they have been militarily, just has a size 
advantage.
  But I do believe that at some point, both of these countries are 
going to try to figure a way out. The question is, Which one of the two 
is going to have the most leverage and the best deal possible, and will 
Ukraine be able to emerge from this as a democracy, as a nation that is 
not under the thumb of Vladimir Putin--another Belarus, as an example? 
I think we have a national interest in the outcome. It is not an 
unlimited national interest. It doesn't mean we spend however much they 
need for however long it takes. But there is an interest.
  I just wanted to say that at the outset. I say that because obviously 
I am informed by my work on the Intelligence Committee, the Foreign 
Relations Committee, and my interest in foreign policy, because I think 
our job here in the Federal Government--we get involved in a lot of 
things that are none of our business, but foreign policy and national 
security are a key part of the Federal Government and what we are 
supposed to be doing here.
  I do believe that in the short and long term, there are things 
there--I don't think I need to convince anyone about Israel and 
Taiwan--that involve the national security of the United States and 
what the world is going to look like in 5, 10, 15 years.
  That said, I would imagine--not that I imagine, actually--I know that 
there are people--if you walked into many places in this country right 
now and you explained to them what was happening, they would be 
puzzled. People would say, no matter how they may feel about Ukraine--I 
think for most Americans, frankly, it is not a priority, not because 
they like Putin and they like Russia but because we have a lot of 
problems that people are dealing with in their everyday lives. I think 
most people would say: OK. But if we are going to do that for Ukraine, 
if we are going to help Ukraine deal with their invasion, shouldn't we 
first or at least at the same time deal with our invasion, what is 
happening to our country?
  So you guys are going to meet all weekend. You are going to fight. 
You are going to call each other names. You are going to drag this 
thing out. You are going to have this big thing that we never do. We 
never stay here on Sundays--it is fine with me. But we never do all of 
this, but when we do it, it is always for somebody else or something 
that is not as important to us. But for something that is important to 
us, something that has to do with America, with our country, it never 
happens.
  How, in essence, can you be helping Ukraine with their invasion but 
not be helping America with its invasion? And it is an invasion, what 
is happening at our southern border.
  These are very conservative numbers, but they are incredibly 
accurate. They come right from both public and nonpublic--not 
classified but nonpublic--information. They are products that are 
produced from the House committee, for example. Let's just say that 
from January 20, 2021, 3.3 million people have entered the United 
States illegally and been released into the country. Of those 3.3 
million people who have entered the country illegally, 99.7 percent of 
them are still here. They have not been deported or removed. Of the 3.3 
million who have been released into this country, over 617,000 of 
them--and these are old numbers; these are numbers from last month--of 
the 3.3 million people who entered the country illegally and were 
released, 617,000 of them either have criminal convictions or pending 
criminal charges. So we have had at least 600,000 convicted criminals, 
suspected criminals, enter the country illegally, free to roam the 
country now.

  People ask, well, how did this happen? Because it has never been 
zero. Let's be clear. It has never been zero. There have never been 
zero illegal people entering into America. But how did this happen? 
Well, let's first start with our law.
  When people talk about immigration around here, they pretend it is 
completely unregulated: We need new laws to fix it because the laws are 
all messed up, and we don't regulate.
  No. The immigration laws in America can be summarized. I mean, it is 
a complex area of law, but at its core, it is quite simple. Immigration 
law in America says this: These are the people who are allowed to be in 
the United States of America, and if someone who is not allowed to be 
in the United States of America enters illegally, you are to detain 
them through removal, meaning you are to detain them in immigration 
detention until their case is either resolved or they are removed from 
the country. That is the law of the United States, and that has been 
the law of the United States for quite some time.
  With that detention requirement that you hold them until they are 
removed, we have always had exceptions, narrow exceptions. For example, 
if the Dalai Lama shows up at the border of the United States and says 
``Hey, I am here because the Chinese are trying to kill me''--
exception, right? There have always been exceptions.
  These are supposed to be narrow exceptions, and they are supposed to 
apply to individuals case by case--humanitarian, things of that nature. 
But for the first time in American history, the current President of 
the United States decided to make the exception the rule--the rule. It 
became the rule that if you arrived here, we would not detain you. The 
exception became those we were detaining. I just gave you the numbers 
of the people who were released. So the exceptions ate up the rule, and 
that is how this happens.
  Why it happens is not hard to understand. I assure you guys--listen, 
I live in an immigrant community. When it comes to immigration, I have 
been in the game for 10 years making these things--you know, looking at 
these things longer. I live it. I live it. My entire family are 
immigrants. My wife's entire family are immigrants. All of my neighbors 
are immigrants. I can't drive two blocks and go anywhere and not be--
other than Miami, FL--surrounded with immigrants from all over the 
hemisphere and all over the world. So when I talk to you about these 
things, I didn't read about it in a magazine; I didn't see a 
documentary; I didn't have some briefing; I talk to people who show me. 
They have shown me. They said: Look, this is the cash-

[[Page S571]]

out payment that I sent to some guy to bring my sister and her husband. 
Here is the Venmo that I sent to some guy to help my family get from 
Cuba to Nicaragua and from Nicaragua to the United States.
  They don't know what the immigration law is. They don't know about 
exceptions, asylum. Here is what they know: They know people who have 
come here, turned themselves in, said ``I am here,'' blah, blah, blah, 
and they were released. They know people who did it, and those people 
tell other people, and the traffickers advertise it.
  So what happens is that when people figure out--and they figure it 
out pretty quickly. Human beings are incentive-based creatures. All of 
us are. That is why we pass laws to punish crime. That is why we raise 
taxes on cigarettes--we want people to smoke less.
  We are incentive-based creatures, and when people know that if you 
can make it inside of the United States and turn yourself in, your 
chances of being released are 85, 90-something percent, more people are 
going to come.
  The numbers don't lie. I don't have it with me. I tried to blow it 
up; couldn't print it on time. But there is a graph that shows--it 
looks like one of those things, you know, those echocardiograms, except 
this one goes straight up. It basically says, here is the number in 
December of 2019, January of 2020. February of 2021, it just spikes 
right up. Why did it spike?
  It spiked because we told people, by the way, if you are a single 
adult--which was the biggest driver that really changed everything--if 
you are a single adult and you come into America illegally and you turn 
yourself in, we will interview you--maybe not even interview you--and 
we will release you into the country. People figure it out.
  And the way you solve it is to reverse that. The law didn't change. 
The immigration law today looks the same as it did in 2019. No 
immigration law has changed in America. What changed is this policy by 
Executive order.
  Remember, when we pass laws, it has to be executed. So look what is 
happening with crime. It is illegal in every jurisdiction in America to 
shoplift, but the places where you see a spike in shoplifting are the 
places where the prosecutors have decided we are not going to prosecute 
those cases.
  And when you tell people, yes, it is illegal to do something but we 
are not going to prosecute it, we are not going to go after it, you are 
going to get it.
  So how do you solve this? You solve it the same way you created it: 
by reversing what created it. That is how you solve it.
  And so a lot of us said: Well, look, if we are going to do all this 
for Ukraine and all of these other countries--but Ukraine was really--
and this is something that you really want, it is important, can't we 
also--so that we look, at least, half sane to the people in this 
country that can't understand how we can spend all this time and energy 
not helping ourselves before we help other countries--can we at least 
deal with the border?
  So they said: OK, we are going to do something on the border.
  And they spent three, four--what, I don't know--8 weeks, whatever, 
negotiating a deal, and then they produced it. I didn't have anything 
to do with that deal. I am not condemning the people that did it. I 
have done immigration negotiations in the past; it is difficult. This 
is even more difficult because it is in the midst of a mass-migration 
crisis.
  But they negotiated a deal, but I didn't negotiate it. I didn't even 
know what was in it until Sunday. And I read it--I read it twice, 
actually--went through it with the knowledge base that I have. But they 
negotiated a deal that most of us, for the most part, to be fair, had 
nothing to do with negotiating. And I realized pretty quickly, this is 
not going to reverse.
  You can call it whatever you want. You can call it border security; 
you can label it anything you want. But this is not going to solve our 
problem. And, immediately, they said: Oh, the Republicans are a bunch 
of liars. The first is: These Republicans, they wanted a border deal; 
we gave them a border deal; and now they want to tank the whole thing. 
They changed their minds.
  I think that was the President: We gave them the exact deal they 
asked for, and they changed their mind.
  You didn't give me the exact deal I asked for. I asked for measures, 
steps, that would actually solve the migration crisis. This bill 
doesn't do that. In fact, I never even asked for a bill. I am not 
against some of the language that is in there. You want to change the 
standard on asylum? Long overdue; but that alone is not going to stop 
the migration crisis. That is what I asked for.
  I didn't negotiate it. I didn't even know what was in it, like I told 
you, until Sunday. And so the solution that I want to see and did want 
to see and continue to want to see, the solution that we could actually 
go back to people and say: Guys, we did something real on the border. 
Yes, we are going to help Ukraine with their invasion, but we actually 
did--something real is also going to happen with our invasion. That was 
not this bill, despite whatever people may say about it.
  We rejected the toughest border deal imaginable, is the other thing 
that people say. You know, like, if somehow, they figured out a way--
you know, they sprinkled holy water upon a vampire with this thing. 
Look, I could spell out a bunch of problems in this bill. I don't have 
time; I am not going to spend the time going through every detail.
  This emergency thing they brag about, emergency power to shut down 
the border, they don't tell you it is limited to 270 days, and the 
President can suspend it at any time. All the President has to say is: 
It is not in our national interest. We need to suspend the emergency.

  By the way, even in the emergency, you still have to process 1,400 
people a day, illegal immigrants a day, even in the midst of an 
emergency.
  But let me focus on what I think is--what I believe to be the most 
blatant trap that was put in place in this bill. And it is one that 
people don't necessarily spot right away if you don't understand 
immigration law and how it has been applied over the last decade.
  So there is this thing in the bill--remember, one of the things that 
people use about immigration is asylum. It takes too long; it takes 8 
to 10 years; huge backlog; courts; the like. It is true. And it is one 
of the incentives, by the way, because people know if you release me 
pending a hearing, 10 years from now you won't even know where I am, 
much less show up at a hearing.
  So they come back and say: Oh, we are prepared to solve that. How did 
they solve it? Well, they create what I call the asylum corps. In 
essence, they are going to go out and they are going to hire thousands 
of Department of Homeland Security agents--bureaucrats, agents--not 
judges--to process these claims, potentially right at the border. 
Right?
  So right at the border, these agents will be able to interact with an 
illegal immigrant, interview them, ask them some questions, and they 
will have the power, they will have the power right there at the border 
to do three things.
  The first is they could say, no, you don't qualify, you are out of 
here. Or we are going to detain you, and you are out of here. They 
could do that. That has not been the history of what has happened until 
now.
  And let me just tell you, from what I know, most of the people who 
sign up for these jobs and this duty do not sign up to kick people out; 
they sign up to help people get in. But that is the asylum, so that is 
the first power.
  The other two things are the likeliest one. The first is: We think 
you might have a claim. We are going to release you pending a hearing 
before a judge, and you get an immediate work permit.
  Right now, you have to wait 6 months for a work permit, even if you 
are released like these people. An immediate work permit--you want to 
talk about a migration magnet? When people figure out, if I get there, 
I have an X percent chance of being given an immediate work permit, 
that is a migration magnet.
  But here is the third thing they can do: They can give you asylum 
right there and then--not a judge; a member of this new asylum corps 
can literally give you asylum right there and then.
  Now, let me be fair. The law says they can do it under the convention 
against torture, which is an international treaty.
  Well, what is that? Well, let me tell you how that has been applied. 
How it

[[Page S572]]

has been applied is that the convention against torture isn't just 
like, we are going to send you back somewhere where they are going to 
waterboard you.
  The convention against torture that has been applied in most of the 
activists' groups that argue means we cannot remove people from this 
country if we are going to send them back to a place where they might 
be kidnapped or where they might be assaulted, not by just the 
government but by nongovernment criminal gangs.
  So, basically, if you come from a country where gangs kidnap people, 
where gangs kill people, where gangs extort people, where gangs 
threaten people, where gangs assault people--if you come from a country 
where that happens, we cannot send you back there under the convention 
of torture. That is their interpretation of it.
  My friends, that is like 100 countries on Earth. That is like almost 
every country represented in the number of people that arrive at the 
border. So, basically, what you will have is an asylum corps with the 
power to grant people asylum right at the border. And let me tell you 
the difference between the asylum corps and an immigration judge: If an 
immigration judge makes that decision, the Attorney General can still 
step in and reverse it. These are irreversible decisions.
  And let me tell you what asylum means. Asylum is basically a green 
card. You are now 5 years away from being a U.S. citizen. That number 
is not going to be zero. If that law and that provision had been in 
place today, some of these 3.3 million people would have already been a 
year or two into their 5-year wait to become citizens and voters of the 
United States of America. That is in that bill.
  And that is what it means when you read past the language and the 
shalls and the this and that and all of that, that is what that 
language means. And you want me to vote for a bill so that a year or 
two from now when the news reports come out that the asylum corps has 
granted asylum and a 5-year path to citizenship to 500,000 people and 
everybody here goes: Well, I didn't know that was in that law--that is 
in the law; that is in that bill; that is there.
  And I could go on; there are other things. The point is this was a 
trap. It was put in there in place, that was the goal. This is not a 
border--that would actually incentivize immigration, knowing what it is 
that incentivizes people to come.
  The other lie is, whoa, without a law, we can't do anything about the 
border. I already explained to you how we got here in the first place: 
We stopped detaining everybody.
  Remember, a few years ago it was--again, let's go back and be clear. 
The children who were being detained was because before we turned them 
over to some guy who claimed to be their uncle, we had to make sure he 
wasn't Jeffrey Dahmer; we had to make sure he wasn't some pedophile; we 
had to make sure it was really their uncle. And in the meantime, you 
have to put them somewhere. But that was inhumane.
  But now it has spread. Now it is the detention of anybody is 
inhumane. You have people out there saying: By the way, we shouldn't 
even put ankle bracelets on people who are released; that is inhumane.

  But the incentive that drove the immigration was we stopped detaining 
single adults. And the word got out really fast. And the traffickers--
this is a business for them. They traffic people; they move people; 
they move drugs. They move contraband, and they move people. And they 
knew this. And they sell it. They advertise it.
  I wish I would have brought some of the pamphlets that they hand out 
or pictures of some of the things they put up on social media in these 
countries advertising the service.
  You don't need a law to fix that because the law hasn't changed. What 
you need is to reverse the Executive orders, the decisions of the 
administration. And the President can do that. In fact, I heard 
yesterday--I think it was NBC News or something reported the President 
is now considering executive actions on the border.
  So at least they have acknowledged that they have that power. A 
reporter asked me yesterday, well, you guys are always against 
executive actions. Well, the executive action I think they need to take 
is to reverse the executive actions that he has taken which created 
this crisis.
  And there are other things that he can do. He can do the ``return to 
Mexico''; he can do the ``safe third country.'' By the way, the ``safe 
third country'' one is an interesting one. I was kind of involved when 
that was put in place. And initially--because it is counterintuitive. 
Initially, a lot of people said: Why would these countries agree to 
that? So let me tell you why Honduras would agree to it, why El 
Salvador agreed to it. Let me tell you why. Because those are transit 
countries.
  And safe third country basically said: If you come through that 
country, once you step foot in that country, you are automatically 
disqualified from getting asylum in the United States.
  Now, I have nothing against these countries, but I promise you that 
the migrants that are going through El Salvador, Honduras, and 
Guatemala were going through. They didn't go to Guatemala, Honduras, El 
Salvador, or Nicaragua, for that matter, to stay there. They went there 
because it was on the way to where they were trying to go.
  The minute migrants realized if I go there, if I go to Honduras, I 
automatically cannot get into the United States, they stopped going to 
Honduras or they stopped going to El Salvador. The countries figured it 
out. I bet you we can get many more countries to sign up for something 
like that, because they are bearing the brunt of being in the middle of 
the migration corridor. We could return to that as well.
  And, yes, we can build barriers. I remember after the horrible events 
of January 6 here in the Capitol, the first thing that went up around 
this entire building was a fence with barbed wire and National Guard. 
The first thing they did to protect the Capitol and themselves was to 
deputize National Guard from all over America and to put fences around 
the Capitol, some of the biggest fences you have ever seen. And they 
went up like that.
  But, somehow, when our country is being invaded and you put up a 
fence and you send the National Guard, this administration will go to 
the Supreme Court and try to stop you. So they will do it to protect 
themselves, but they won't do it to protect America.
  My friends, the truth is that Biden doesn't want to stop the border 
crisis, and the reason why is politics. I know his memory is probably 
not the best, but I remember that he spent 3 years repeatedly saying--
not just him, all the deputies, people in this Chamber, all these know-
it-alls on television: There is no crisis at the border. There is not a 
crisis. It is being exaggerated, exaggerated by a bunch of xenophobes 
and racists.
  But now it is a top issue in the country to voters. It wasn't a 
crisis until it became a crisis in New York and Chicago and all these 
major cities around the country who now suddenly--you know, when it was 
happening to Texas, when this was happening on the border in Arizona, 
as if somehow all the people that came here were--3.3 million people 
were all going to stay in Eagle Pass, TX. But once it got into their 
cities, once it started impacting them, now it became a problem too. 
Once you had to start closing schools because you needed to make it a 
migrant shelter, now it was a crisis. Now when you have a gang of 
pickpocketers running through New York assaulting police officers, now 
it is a crisis. Now, when the residents of your own city are screaming 
at you, ``Why are you spending all this money when we have our own 
homeless problem?'' now you have a crisis. And voters were saying it 
too.

  And so I imagine--I am certain--that the people involved in the Biden 
reelection effort came to him and said: Sir, we need to have a plan. We 
need to have a plan, and the plan needs to be something that, at least, 
looks like we are trying to stop it but doesn't upset that element of 
our base who actually believes that anyone who comes here should be 
allowed to come here.
  And that element exists. That element exists. There are people in 
American politics and in American political discourse who believe that, 
if you make it across the border, virtually anyone who comes here--
unless, like, the worst possible human being--if you make it across the 
border, you should

[[Page S573]]

be allowed to stay, even if you came illegally.
  They had to come up with a plan. So what was the plan? Here was the 
plan, and I called this out in December. The plan is: Let's do a border 
deal. Let's call it a border deal, but let's make sure it doesn't stop 
migration because we don't want to upset our base. But let's also make 
sure it is bipartisan. Let's get some Republicans to sign on to it, and 
then let's get it passed through the Senate. And then when the House 
kills it, we can say: I, Joe Biden, tried to fix the border, but these 
Neanderthals, MAGA House members, they killed it. So blame them from 
now on.
  In fact, I am not speculating here. There is nothing that I am just 
like psychically coming up with. There is an article in POLITICO in 
which an unnamed source in the Biden campaign was saying: This is 
perfect. If they pass it, we can claim credit for a bipartisan deal and 
tell people: Now, be patient. It is going to take time to work, but it 
is bipartisan. If it doesn't pass, he can blame the Republicans and say 
they own it.
  And those talking points were already being said, including by some 
of my colleagues here on some Sunday shows that I saw. They were 
already saying that even before the deal was already out there. That 
was the plan.
  But he will never fix it--one, because there are people in the base 
that don't want it to be fixed. There are people in American politics, 
as I said already, who think anyone who comes here should be allowed to 
come and stay. There are others, frankly, who see a bunch of voters. 
They see a bunch of future voters.
  Do you know what? Let's find a way to get people asylum. Asylum is 
perfect. It puts them instantly on a path to citizenship. In 4 to 6 
years from now, we are going to have a bunch of new voters, and they 
will vote for us, and they will remember we are the ones that let them 
in.
  So that is another element of it.
  But I want to go back to the one about the elements of their base 
that believe in open borders, whether they admit it or not. And some of 
them actually do admit it. There are actually people who have told me 
to my face, ``People should be allowed to live in any country that they 
want,'' which, I suppose, in a free society, you can have a right to 
any opinion you want. I assure you, it is not a majority position in 
America. In fact, I assure you, it is not a majority position in any 
country. But, somehow, they think it should be our position.
  And if you don't think that the elements of a base have influence 
over our politics, I submit to you what is happening right now with 
Israel policy. So we have already seen, I would imagine, a small 
minority--but nonetheless a minority--of radical, anti-Semitic pro-
Hamas activists who are out there. They are threatening to vote against 
Joe Biden. They have said it: We will vote. Do not count on our vote. 
We are going to vote against you. Your name is ``Genocide Joe''--they 
call him.
  They disrupt his speeches. He tried to give a speech the other day. I 
think there were like 40 interruptions. They have been in the hallways 
here. It is not just the weirdos from these CODEPINK communist groups, 
but it is others, screaming at us: You need to do this; you need to do 
that--all this stuff that is out there.
  But they say: Sir, you have a problem. We have an element of our base 
in some States that say they are not going to vote for you because you 
are helping Israel too much.
  And that is where you see the leak. The first leak that came out is: 
Oh, the President hung up on Netanyahu.
  Then you see another leak a couple of weeks ago: We are going to have 
a two-state solution.
  Never mind the fact that the two most prominent Palestinian groups, 
sadly, in the region are groups--one of them is going to wind up in the 
government of the second state--and these are groups that do things 
like give cash rewards for killing Jews. The more Jews you kill, the 
more money your family gets if you are a martyr. Pay to slay--it is 
real. Groups that, for example, in their schools, when their kids are 
4, 5, 6 years of age, their school books, their textbooks teach them: 
Jews are subhuman, and they are evil--groups that are not interested in 
a two-state solution. These groups are calling for a one-state 
solution: ``from the river to the sea''--no Jews, only them.
  So let's give them their own country. Now, I would love for that to 
be possible, but not as long as those people are around. But that is 
the other thing they threw out there.
  And then, yesterday, we read that the White House has sent 
emissaries. Top aides from the White House went to Michigan to meet 
with some of these upset activists to see if we can somehow bring them 
along so they will vote for him in November and stop being mean to Joe 
Biden over Israel.
  Well, do you know who some of these people were? Multiple--more than 
one of them--were people that have openly--openly--been supportive of 
both Hamas and Hezbollah and call them ``freedom fighters.'' At least 
one of them is a guy who has publicly said, on multiple occasions, that 
the U.S. Government is controlled by Zionist money, by Jewish money. 
That is who the White House went to meet with yesterday.
  And then, last night, we are treated to a press conference by the 
President of the United States, and in what I imagine was an unscripted 
moment--maybe not--he said Israel's response to Hamas ``has been over 
the top,'' which is ironic, because I support Israel funding, but here 
we are today being asked to pass a bill that has all this money for 
Israel, which I support.
  So what are we funding? We are funding Israel's ``over the top'' 
campaign against Hamas?
  So it doesn't make any sense, except for the politics. That is how 
politics influences all of this. You know, I would conclude by just 
taking us back to the original point, which is, the reason why I have 
voted already to move to proceed to this. I just don't know how you go 
to people in everyday life, hard-working people, and say to them--
people who are upset because they feel like our country's border is 
being overrun, and it is--and they say: How come we are not doing 
anything about that, something real? Like, why aren't we making that a 
priority? Why don't we ever read that the Senate is staying in through 
the weekend arguing and fighting and working on something real to stop 
the border? How come that never gets a priority?

  The growing number of Americans who always feel like, when it comes 
to a major issue and a major fight, they are always second--behind 
another country, behind another group, behind somebody else--who have 
been, for the better part of 20 years, told: We have to take care of 
others before we focus on your problems. Let's send our jobs and our 
factories to other countries because it is good for the global economy. 
I know we have homeless veterans committing record amounts of suicides 
and these tragedies, but let's spend more money housing migrants in 
this country illegally to begin with.
  People who watched the news last week, OK, a roving gang of migrants 
from Venezuela--I mean, it is interesting because, for a year now, the 
Venezuelan community in South Florida has been telling me to be careful 
because some of the people who are coming from Venezuela now are 
clearly gang bangers. And, you know, you have to prove that. I am not 
saying it is zero percent, but they were right. They warned me a year 
ago, and now we are seeing it. And you saw it last week when--what?--
five or seven of them assaulted police officers, were arrested, were 
released within an hour without any bail, flipped the middle finger to 
America, and walked right out, back to the migrant shelter, paid for by 
taxpayers.
  You saw it last Sunday, when an illegal migrant of Palestinian 
descent went to Nassau County in New York, walked up to some guy's 
house and tore down his Israeli and American flags. When the guy 
confronted him, he assaulted the guy and started screaming things like: 
We are going to kill all the Jews.
  Those are just two examples. I could give you more, but they are 
there. People are watching this stuff, and they are angry. They say: 
Why don't you guys do something about that? Why aren't you staying 
through the weekend about that? Why aren't those people being deported 
immediately?
  How about these people here on student visas? You are a visitor to 
the

[[Page S574]]

United States of America on a student visa--on a student visa or 
whatever visa--and you are in the street calling for ``intifada,'' but 
we can't deport you. They won't deport you. We know who you are. You 
are not here illegally; you are here on a visa. If you had said all 
that stuff, we probably wouldn't have given you the visa, but now that 
you are here, you get to keep the visa? Deport those people. They 
won't. Why aren't you fighting about that?
  Most Americans have nothing against Ukraine. Most Americans want to 
help Ukraine, but I don't think it is unreasonable for them to say: 
Well, what about us? What about our country? What about our invasion? 
What about our border?
  And I want to say this with as much respect as I can. There is nobody 
in the Senate that can lecture me on immigration. This is not a 
political drive. I have lived it my whole life.
  This is not immigration--3.3 million people released into the 
country. And 5 to 10,000 people a day illegally arrive in the country. 
That is not immigration. Immigration is a good thing. Mass migration is 
a bad thing, and that is what this is. This is mass migration, and it 
is not good for anyone. It is not even good for the migrants, many of 
whom are raped and killed along the way.
  It is good for the traffickers. It is good for the enemies of this 
country, but it is not good for the migrants. This is mass migration, 
and it reminds me, well, if you are against this and you want to be 
strict about immigration, that is anti-immigrant, which is silly, at 
least if they say it to me.
  But I remember, like, I am not anti-rain. I think rain is a good 
thing. I think we need rain, right? I am anti-flood. I am not against 
the rain. I am against flooding. Does being against flooding make you 
anti-rain? No. And being against mass migration does not make you anti-
immigration, because mass migration is not immigration.
  And beyond the issues of sovereignty and common sense and the costs 
involved--beyond all of that--do we really think that you can release 
600,000 people with either criminal convictions or pending criminal 
charges into the country and nothing is going to happen? Do you think 
you can release 600,000 people with criminal histories and they are, 
all of a sudden, all going to become entrepreneurs and start some tech 
company? No. The chances are that a lot of them are going to continue 
to be criminals. You are going to have a crime wave. It is already 
starting, and no part of this country will be immune from it.
  And do you think ISIS and, for that matter, every terrorist 
organization in the world, no matter what sewer they live in or some 
cave they are hiding in--you don't think they are aware that the 
largest, most effective human smuggling operation in all of human 
history is operating right on the border of the United States? You 
don't think they are aware of it? Because the guys that were involved 
in 9/11--those animals, savages--they actually came here on a visa 
pretending to be flight students.
  The next 9/11, God forbid, they don't have to pretend anything. All 
they have to say is: I come from a country where people are kidnapped 
and where people are often victims of crime, and you must let me in. 
And, for all we know, some of them may actually become citizens because 
they are going to get asylum.
  You don't think that these terrorist groups are aware? I can't and 
won't divulge any intelligence information. So let's just use common 
sense. Common sense tells you that these groups and these terrorist 
organizations understand that the largest human smuggling, migrant 
smuggling operation in the history of mankind operates right at border 
of the United States. And we don't think anything is going to come out 
as a result of it?
  Something bad is going to happen. Something bad--really bad--is bound 
to happen, and, when it does, remember this day, because, when it does, 
when something really bad happens, when we are overrun by a horrible 
crime wave and multiple cities--guys, we lived it.
  I was a child. I actually didn't live in Miami at the time. We had 
moved away for a few years. The Mariel boatlift brought 200,000--less 
than 200,000--people from Cuba all at once. It took Miami 10 years to 
dig out of that. Bill Clinton lost his reelection because he agreed to 
take in some of those people into a Federal facility in Arkansas, and 
they set it on fire.
  And there are a lot of people who came through Mariel who did fine, 
and there were a bunch of criminals and sadists and lunatics as well, 
because you take a lot of people from anywhere, and you are going to 
have the good, the bad, and the ugly.
  Well, we have something just like this happening not once, over a 
span of weeks, but, literally, every month we have two Mariels. And you 
think that you are going to allow a flood of people into America and 
something bad is not going to happen? Sadly, it is. It is just a matter 
of time. And when it does--when it does--things that might sound 
extreme to some aren't just going to sound reasonable, they are going 
to sound overdue. And do you know what they are going to ask us? How 
could you have allowed this to happen?

  So I end where I began. I know that if all you do is spend your time 
here and watch those networks and read these columnists and newspapers, 
you may lose this perspective; but I promise you, in the real world, on 
planet Earth, in this country among everyday people, most of them are 
asking themselves: Do you want to help Ukraine? We are for it. Do you 
want to help Israel? Of course. Yes, we should help Taiwan.
  But who is helping America? Why isn't helping our country deal with 
this migrant crisis No. 1 before those other things? Don't they tell 
you on the airplane, if the oxygen mask deploys, put on your mask and 
then put the one on your kid? What good are we, how do you suppose--
America, to anyone in the world, to any country on this planet--if we 
are falling apart inside?
  And then, who do we work for? We work for Americans. I am a U.S. 
citizen, a U.S. Senator. I care about things that are going on in the 
world. No one has ever accused me of being an isolationist. And those 
things do matter in America. But you have to start with fundamentals, 
and that means you have to be strong here at home in order to be strong 
for our allies.
  We are being invaded every single day. Today, 8 to 10,000 people will 
enter the United States illegally and unlawfully. We don't know who 
most of them are. Don't let them tell you that they do. You can buy a 
fake passport. You can buy state travel documents in Brazil. In 
multiple countries in Latin America, you can buy them. It is an 
industry.
  So I am just telling you, we are going to have something bad happen 
and people are going to ask: Why didn't you guys fight over that? Why 
didn't you stay over the weekend about that?
  So why are we focused on an invasion of another country--which is 
important--but not focused on the invasion of our own country?
  And it can be solved. The President's executive orders created it, 
and he can reverse it, but he won't. So here we are.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Butler). The Senator from Indiana.


                       Tribute to Abraham Lincoln

  Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, as a Senator from the State of Indiana, I 
just can't let February pass without offering a tribute to one of our 
State's favorite sons, Abraham Lincoln.
  As we approach his birthday, we celebrate how Lincoln's story is 
perhaps the ultimate example of American opportunity. Lincoln spent the 
formative days of his childhood in the Hoosier wilderness, and he 
ultimately rose from the humblest of circumstances: a log cabin all the 
way up to the White House.
  As President, he helped preserve our Union and end slavery, setting a 
course so that all Americans, regardless of race or circumstances, 
could follow his upwards path. Lincoln challenged America to honor the 
promise in its Declaration of Independence, that all men are created 
equal. And he reminds us still today that if we fail to do so, 
government by consent of the governed cannot long endure.
  I think all of us here in the U.S. Senate today can attest these are 
difficult times. We face all sorts of challenges, foreign and domestic; 
and therefore, our politics are difficult. But I would argue--and I do 
so here today--that the politics we are facing today aren't nearly as 
difficult as those that Abraham Lincoln faced.
  During a week like this, where passions run high, we have had 
numerous

[[Page S575]]

debates behind closed doors and on this floor, we should keep 
perspective, and we should avoid dramatic comparisons and take dire 
predictions with a grain of salt.
  But concern about the national discourse which informs our political 
system is indeed well founded. Dialogue between Americans so essential 
to the maintenance of a democratic republic has coarsened and reached 
the point that at times, it scarcely resembles conversation. This form 
of estrangement leads to hurt feelings, separateness, civil 
dysfunction. And my fear and what brings me down to this floor--not 
just to honor a great man--I fear that this portends much worse 
divisions moving forward.
  Abraham Lincoln knew this. He understood this dynamic. Decades before 
the Civil War, he identified a remedy in an address that upset the 
residents of Springfield, IL. You see, 19th century America was awash 
with passionate reform movements, much like today, in the great 
American tradition. Many of their followers sought to cure societal 
ills with great zeal and commitment.

  One example was the temperance movement--sort of a dated term--but 
the temperance movement was a campaign against drinking the ``demon 
rum,'' alcoholic beverages. On February 22, 1842, the 110th anniversary 
of George Washington's birthday, Abraham Lincoln spoke to a gathering 
of reformers at Springfield's Second Presbyterian Church, as part of a 
temperance festival. It must have been a grand old time.
  Lincoln was 33 years old. He was a member of Illinois' House of 
Representatives. And as he later said, he was ``an old line Whig.'' It 
was a political party whose base, to borrow a modern term, included 
members of social reform movements. But Lincoln did not use this 
occasion to curry favor with his base. No. Instead, Abraham Lincoln 
offered advice that is still relevant to us today.
  The invitation to speak came from Springfield's chapter of the 
Washingtonian Temperance Society. This organization was founded 2 years 
prior in Baltimore by six friends, all recovering alcoholics. In a 
short period of time, the Washingtonians started a revolution in 
treating addiction. The society's numbers quickly swelled just a few 
years after its founding. Chapters spread across the country, into the 
frontier.
  In the Washingtonians' success, Lincoln recognized a particular means 
of building coalitions and addressing intractable problems. At its core 
was something especially relevant, I would argue, in our era of 
addition by subtraction, as he put it, ``persuasion''--``. . . 
persuasion, kind, unassuming persuasion.''
  Previous efforts to curb alcoholism, you see, as Lincoln recounted, 
were often self-righteous in their nature--perhaps that 
characterization sounds familiar to some when we reflect on the current 
discourse--self-righteous in their nature and impractical in their 
demands. Lest I sound quaint, that rings a bit true to me when we 
reflect on present-day Washington and the debates we sometimes have on 
this floor.
  The Washingtonian's approach and expectations differed, and that is 
why they were successful. They damned the drink but not the drinker. 
Their cure, such as it was, was based in compassion, based in 
understanding, not condemnation. They saw a fellow citizen suffering 
from the disease as a friend in need of help, not a helpless sinner.
  Lincoln contrasted the approach and effect of the Washingtonians with 
their predecessors, the older reformers. The older reformers, Lincoln 
recalled, communicated ``in the thundering tones of anathema and 
denunciation.''
  Now, we are all, no matter our political persuasion, familiar with 
those ``thundering tones.'' The truth is, we are all guilty. We are all 
guilty of those ``thundering tones'' from time to time. And perhaps, 
from time to time, those thundering tones are appropriate and 
necessary, and they have a great deal of impact when used sparingly. We 
are all guilty from time to time, forgetting that we are erring men and 
women.
  But Lincoln suggested a gentler alternative: ``It is an old and a 
true maxim,'' he reasoned, ``that a `drop of honey catches more flies 
than a gallon of gall.' '' That is how the Hoosier put it.
  It is that drop of honey, Lincoln continued, which draws men and 
women to our sides, convinces them we are indeed friends. Friends--this 
from one of the most intelligent, successful, effective, polemicist 
debaters, litigators, and politicians in all of human history; he 
regarded his opponents as friends.
  And this, in his words, is ``the great highroad'' to their reason:

       [W]hen once gained, you will find but little trouble in 
     convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause, if 
     indeed that cause really be a just one.

  Some Lincolnian humanity mixed in with age-old wisdom.
  Now, across our politics and in our media, we seem so convinced 
sometimes of our justness, of our cause, that it has become in vogue to 
cancel--a modern term, ``cancel''--the other side and chase away those 
on our own who do not see them, that other side, as enemies--tribalism, 
unleashed.
  Where does this tribalistic impulse to cancel and ostracize lead us? 
It is an easy way to get booked on television these days. It is 
guaranteed to increase the number of social media followers you have. 
It might even rile up a rally or a crowd from time to time. But Abraham 
Lincoln, before the age of social media, predicted exactly where this 
would lead us.
  Deem a fellow citizen a foe ``to be shunned and despised, and he will 
retreat within himself, close all the avenues to his head and his heart 
. . .''--it is human nature and, therefore, unchanged and unchangeable. 
``Such is man,'' he continued, ``and so must he be understood by those 
who would lead him, even to his own best interest.''
  Abraham Lincoln believed that the American Revolution defied human 
history by proving men and women capable of governing themselves. Our 
original birth of freedom led to the design of a republic, a republic 
in which citizens decide what is in their best interest. Determining it 
often requires passionate, loud, angry debates properly circumscribed 
by a social, moral, ethical framework. It includes a balance with 
generous measures of trust and understanding. An absence of this 
balance gives way to discord, and that discord makes us all weaker--
collectively weaker, even individually weaker.

  On the surface, Lincoln's speech in 1842 was about a means of 
combating alcoholism and achieving reforms. Look deeper, though. Its 
passages still today illustrate how we can continue to prove history 
wrong together. Remember--remember the power of reason even in our most 
passionate arguments. Find the empathy to form a bridge to our 
estranged countrymen--they are out there--and allow forbearance toward 
those among them we may disagree with--forbearance.
  Abraham Lincoln relied on these values throughout his career even in 
America's darkest hour. They remain vital to our national harmony and 
to our common good. So, as we mark the occasion of Lincoln's birthday 
in 2024, we should call on these values once again.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request.
  Mr. YOUNG. Yes.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.
  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, let me start by thanking my friend 
and colleague from Indiana for providing those wise words and good 
examples from Abraham Lincoln.


                          Supplemental Funding

  Madam President, I come to the floor today to discuss the National 
Security Act, which has many important components, including support 
for Ukraine, for Israel, and for countries in the Indo-Pacific, as well 
as humanitarian assistance to help respond to crises around the world, 
including in Ukraine, in Gaza, the West Bank, Sudan, and elsewhere. It 
also includes funding for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program to 
better protect those nonprofits here in the United States, including 
places of worship, that face elevated risks from hate crimes.
  I have spoken many times on this floor about the imperative of 
providing the people of Ukraine with more desperately needed military 
assistance to protect their sovereignty and to protect their democracy. 
We must not abandon them to Putin's brutal onslaught. The Ukrainian 
people are putting their blood and their lives on the

[[Page S576]]

line to defend their freedom. The least we can do--the least we can 
do--is provide them, together with our allies, with the weapons and 
other support they need to do that.
  It is not only the freedom of Ukraine that is at stake; abandoning 
the people of Ukraine to Putin would destroy our credibility with our 
allies and our adversaries. It would undermine our word with both 
friend and foe not only in Europe but around the world.
  Let there be no doubt that President Xi is keeping one eye on what 
happens in Ukraine as he keeps the other eye trained on Taiwan.
  To my Senate colleagues, you cannot say that you want to deter 
President Xi from attempting the forcible takeover of Taiwan if you are 
prepared to wave the white flag in the face of Putin's aggression. You 
can't say you are tough on China if you are weak on Russia and Putin.
  This bill also provides important security assistance to partners in 
the Indo-Pacific region to protect their sovereignty and support our 
common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific. As the chair of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific, I 
have worked hard on a bipartisan basis to advance that goal.
  Today, I want to focus the remainder of my remarks on the provisions 
in the supplemental to provide more U.S. security assistance to Israel.
  The horror of the October 7 Hamas terror attacks against Israel 
cannot, must not, and will not be erased or forgotten. About 1,200 
people were brutally murdered, and 240 people were taken hostage. As I 
have said many times in the aftermath of that heinous attack and those 
kidnappings, Israel not only has the right but the duty to defend 
itself and take the actions necessary to prevent any future October 
7's. Never forget and never again.
  I stand steadfastly with the people of Israel in pursuing that 
objective and securing the release of all the hostages. Given the 
terrible news of the deaths of as many as one-fifth of the remaining 
hostages, the urgency of bringing the rest home could not be more 
clear.
  I also believe that, while it is a just war, a just war must still be 
fought justly. As President Biden, Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, 
and many others have repeated, how a war is conducted matters. It 
matters for both moral and strategic reasons.
  As Americans, we remember the collective anguish we experienced after 
the 9/11 terror attacks. We are also acutely aware of the unintended 
consequences of strategic overreach stemming from shared anger and 
pain. These were important lessons--lessons that apply today.
  We all recognize that Hamas's despicable tactic of operating from 
among the civilian population makes it more difficult to target the 
enemy, but that does not absolve the Netanyahu government of the duty 
to take necessary measures to avoid civilian casualties. That is why, 
back on December 2 of last year, Secretary Austin said:

       Protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral 
     responsibility and a strategic one.

  Those sentiments were echoed by Secretary Blinken in December of last 
year when he said that it is ``imperative that Israel put a premium on 
civilian protection.'' The Secretary of State has emphasized that point 
repeatedly since then.
  Nor does the horror of the October 7 attack justify the humanitarian 
catastrophe in Gaza--a catastrophe that began when the Netanyahu 
government imposed a total siege on the people in that very narrow 
strip of land, and that has continued as his coalition places 
unnecessary obstacles in the way of getting vital, desperately needed, 
lifesaving assistance to innocent civilians there.
  Over 2 million Palestinian civilians, who have nothing to do with 
Hamas, are on the verge of starvation and need help to survive. That is 
why Secretary Blinken has emphasized the importance of getting ``more 
humanitarian assistance to people who so desperately need it in Gaza.'' 
The situation is awful, and it is getting worse by the day.
  To those who say that all this aid is being diverted to Hamas, let me 
just say that is factually untrue, and I want to read a statement I 
received not that long ago from Ambassador Satterfield, who is our 
humanitarian coordinator in charge of humanitarian assistance to Gaza.
  His statement reads:

       Today, I have not received any allegations, evidence, or 
     reports of any incidents of Hamas diversion or theft of U.S. 
     or other assistance or fuel from U.N.-delivered assistance 
     from any of our partners or from the Government of Israel 
     since the humanitarian assistance resumed in Gaza on October 
     21st.

  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that his full statement be 
printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                         Satterfield Statement

       To date, I have not received any allegations, evidence or 
     reports of any incidence of Hamas diversion or theft of U.S. 
     or other assistance or fuel from UN delivered assistance from 
     any of our partners or from the Government of Israel since 
     humanitarian assistance resumed in Gaza October 21.
       I have received reports of several incidents of UN and 
     Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) aid trucks being taken 
     for immediate consumption by vulnerable civilians in Gaza, my 
     understanding based on direct conversations with the UN is 
     that these recent incidents are not due to systemic or 
     directed diversion by Hamas but rather undertaken by 
     desperate communities that are experiencing a grave level of 
     scarcity, under threat of constant kinetic operations, and 
     have been displaced, in some cases multiple times.
       While my team and I are routinely in touch with the UN on 
     aid assistance delivery and have asked that they report any 
     indications of Hamas-directed diversion to the U.S., we do 
     not have the same visibility on the distribution of aid 
     consigned from the Egyptian Red Crescent to PRCS for onward 
     delivery in Gaza. We can provide further context in a 
     briefing.
       We continue to have conversations with COGAT and the UN on 
     the looting and diversion risks in Gaza and have asked them 
     to alert us should there be evidence of Hamas-directed 
     diversion of assistance. All humanitarian assistance in Gaza 
     is reviewed, inspected, and monitored by COGAT. Our teams in 
     Israel and Washington, D.C. continue to engage with the 
     Israeli government on this matter.

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Unfortunately, the Biden administration's urgent 
pleas have mostly fallen on deaf ears with Netanyahu's coalition. Just 
a few days ago, we saw Secretary Blinken in Jerusalem, meeting with 
Prime Minister Netanyahu, urging that Israel not take military action 
in Rafah.
  What is Rafah? Rafah is a city in Gaza that is right on the Egyptian-
Gaza border. Before the war started, there were about 300,000, 400,000 
people in Rafah. Today, you have about 1.4 million people crammed into 
Rafah because over a million people who have been displaced from other 
parts of Gaza went to Rafah because they were told it was a safe place 
to go.
  Despite what Secretary Blinken said and despite the fact that just 
the other day, John Kirby, the national security spokesman, said that 
the United States would not support a major military operation in 
Rafah--nevertheless, within hours of Secretary Blinken's meeting with 
the Prime Minister, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that they are going 
to go into Rafah. It is just one of many, many examples of where our 
requests have been rebuffed.
  We have made some incremental progress from time to time. For 
example, after many, many requests and urgings, we saw a while back the 
long-delayed reopening of the Kerem Shalom crossing to allow some more 
trucks into Gaza. But the reality is that the number of trucks and the 
amount of aid getting into Gaza is nowhere near what is necessary to 
meet the dire humanitarian situation.
  Here we are 4 months into this war, and over 27,000 Palestinians have 
been killed, over two-thirds of them women and children, and that does 
not include those who are still buried beneath the rubble.
  Wes Bryant, who helped lead the U.S. targeting against ISIS, has 
written about the unacceptably high levels of civilian casualties in 
Gaza.
  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that his op-ed be printed in 
the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

 I Led Strike Cells Against ISIS--Israel's Strike Campaign in Gaza Is 
                              Unacceptable

       Nearly three months into Israel's war in Gaza, the casualty 
     data that has emerged is deeply troubling to me as an expert 
     in close air support and targeting.
       Israel was wholly justified in responding to Hamas's 
     inhuman attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the terror group 
     tortured and gunned down hundreds of people and entire 
     families.

[[Page S577]]

     But its aggressive campaign across the Gaza Strip has slain 
     almost 22,000 people, up to 70 percent of whom have been 
     women and children, with the majority of deaths attributed to 
     Israeli airstrikes. If these figures are anywhere near 
     accurate, civilian loss from Israel's strike campaign is 
     completely at odds with the standards that my colleagues and 
     I followed for years, including during major urban offensives 
     against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
       I spent a career as a Joint Terminal Attack Controller 
     (JTAC) in the U.S. Air Force--the airpower experts who 
     coordinate and call in airstrikes. In 2014, I was a key 
     member of the special operations response force sent to 
     Baghdad to establish the strike cells that helped bring down 
     the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. As a senior targeting 
     professional, certified by the U.S. Central Command to 
     conduct collateral damage estimation and analysis, 
     safeguarding the civilian populace from airstrikes was a core 
     aspect of my job. And while the United States may not be 
     perfect in this realm, the reality is that the Israeli 
     military has demonstrated a far higher tolerance for civilian 
     casualties than the U.S. military, even when compared to our 
     most sensitive operations.
       In early December, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated 
     that, thus far in the course of its campaign in Gaza, 
     approximately two civilians had been killed for every Hamas 
     fighter. IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus defended that 
     ratio on CNN, calling it ``tremendously positive'' in light 
     of Hamas embedding itself within the civilian population.
       A modern, first-world military should never view a 2:1 
     civilian-to-combatant death ratio as acceptable, let alone 
     remotely ``positive.''
       This ratio exceeds that of the U.S. operation to destroy 
     ISIS's de facto capital in Raqqa, Syria, which itself became 
     a cautionary tale for civilian harm in dense urban fighting. 
     There, airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition killed more than 
     1,600 civilians during months of bombardment, according to an 
     Amnesty International report. The U.S. military has argued 
     that Amnesty's civilian death for Raqqa is significantly 
     overestimated and can be considered a worst-case 
     approximation. Even so, given that Raqqa was the last ISIS 
     stronghold in Syria and harbored thousands of ISIS fighters, 
     we can assess a civilian casualty ratio nowhere near that of 
     Israel's campaign in Gaza.
       Yet the civilian casualty rates in Raqqa were still 
     considered unacceptable by U.S. standards and became a 
     significant driver of the Pentagon's civilian harm mitigation 
     and response reforms. The differences between Israeli and 
     American-led air wars goes further.
       Nearly half of the munitions Israel has dropped in Gaza 
     since Oct. 7 have been unguided bombs, and Israel has 
     regularly used bombs weighing as much as 2,000 pounds within 
     densely populated refugee encampments and near besieged 
     hospitals. This is almost unheard of in U.S. airstrike 
     planning.
       First, refugee encampments and hospitals are protected 
     sites within U.S. targeting methodology. Intentionally 
     striking in, or even within close proximity to, these areas 
     is almost never on the table.
       Second, unguided bombs can miss their intended target by 
     dozens of meters. The only time we used them was in areas 
     with little possibility of civilians being present, such as 
     to destroy a weapons cache.
       Further, the size of most bombs we dropped in urban areas 
     rarely exceeded 500 pounds--even then, we most often chose 
     warheads with smaller blasts and less fragmentation that were 
     designed to limit collateral damage.
       And in all but the rarest of strike operations, my 
     authorized threshold for risk of civilian casualties was 
     zero, meaning that strikes would not be approved if there was 
     risk of even one civilian being killed. The IDF continually 
     carries out strikes in locations where high risk of civilian 
     death is well understood.
       The justifications Israeli officials have offered for high 
     civilian casualties include Hamas's use of civilians as 
     involuntary human shields. However, in U.S. strike 
     operations, such excuses are never an option. Regardless of 
     how the enemy is conducting itself--how embedded within the 
     civilian populace they are or how many civilians they are 
     intentionally surrounding themselves with--this never 
     absolves us of the obligation to protect civilians.
       Sadly, many U.S. defense analysts have nearly stepped over 
     one another to legally and morally justify the high rates of 
     civilian casualties in Gaza.
       In an interview on CNN in December, a prominent defense 
     analyst from the U.S. Military Academy irresponsibly insisted 
     that the IDF strike campaign has been ``proportional, very 
     discriminate, very precise.'' I can state, without 
     reservation, that it simply has not shown any of these 
     qualities.
       Just one example of what has, unfortunately, become many in 
     the course of Israel's strike campaign in Gaza includes the 
     IDF's deliberate and continued targeting within densely 
     populated refugee camps, even while knowing that these areas 
     have not been successfully evacuated by civilians. Such 
     strikes demonstrate far from any level of discrimination and 
     precision that I was expected to exercise as a U.S. targeting 
     professional.
       I can recount watching our enemies maneuver in real time, 
     or tracking a terrorist cell for weeks to a specific 
     location, yet not being able to strike because we assessed 
     that civilians were potentially within the strike radius. 
     Although it is frustrating to be constrained from striking an 
     enemy when we see him plainly in our sights--this is the 
     humane way to conduct warfare. It is one of the major 
     qualities that separates us from our enemies and, 
     importantly, it is what the international law of armed 
     conflict was created for.
       Since October, members of the Biden administration--
     including President Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken 
     and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin--have repeatedly spoken 
     against Israel's strike campaign, acknowledging the 
     devastating scale of civilian loss in Gaza. Yet the 
     administration has, thus far, failed to effect any meaningful 
     change on the part of Israel's strike operations, and 
     continues to send arms and munitions. Israel is the top 
     recipient of U.S. foreign military aid, receiving $3.3 
     billion annually, including the supply of air-to-ground 
     munitions used in their strike campaign.
       This is a conversation that must be had, as our actions 
     demonstrate that we are complicit in the massive civilian 
     toll in Gaza. And this carries strategic, legal and moral 
     considerations. In my career hunting America's enemies with 
     airstrikes, it was my job to be calculated and precise in 
     targeting our enemies while being compassionate and vigilant 
     in safeguarding the civilian populace. We can stand by 
     Israel's right to defend its homeland, and the necessity to 
     defeat Hamas, while also doing far more to influence change 
     in its targeting and strike operations in Gaza.
       A call for the humanitarian revision of the military 
     actions of Israel is no more antisemitic than valuing 
     Palestinian civilian lives is pro-Hamas. This overriding 
     rhetoric is the definition of logical fallacy, and only 
     blinds us.

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. It is not only the extremely high civilian death 
toll; it is the over 67,000 wounded, the over 1.7 million displaced. It 
is the huge damage to civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, 
schools, mosques, and churches. It is the toll from humanitarian aid 
workers killed and journalists killed. The level of death and 
destruction in Gaza is simply inhumane.
  For just one small but still powerful example, I urge my colleagues 
to read the Washington Post story from last Friday--a week ago--about a 
6-year old girl, Hind Hamada, who is trying to get to safety in a car 
with her aunt, her uncle, and her five young cousins. The car was hit 
by tank fire, and all of those who were in the car with Hind died. She 
was severely injured. She got on a phone to try to call for help, and 
there are recordings of her calls for help as her family members lay 
dead around her in the car. The last recording on the phone call she 
made to paramedics who were unable to reach her were:

       Come and take me.

  She was killed.
  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed 
in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

 A 6-Year-Old in Gaza City was Calling To Be Rescued. Did Anyone Find 
                                  Her?

       The Hamada family was trying to get to safety. An order 
     from the Israeli military had gone out earlier last Monday, 
     ordering them to evacuate their neighborhood in Gaza City. 
     Bashar, 44, and his wife Anam, 43, piled their children and 
     their young niece, Hind, into the car.
       They would never reach their destination.
       The full picture of the tragedy that befell the family 
     remains incomplete. Some details could not be confirmed. What 
     is beyond dispute is that their car came under fire; the 
     parents and most of the children were killed; a 6-year-old 
     girl begged for hours to be rescued; paramedics were 
     dispatched; then communications were lost.
       The Washington Post reconstructed the events of that day by 
     interviewing three family members, five members of the 
     Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and reviewing audio of 
     phone conversations between dispatchers and children in the 
     car. The family's story is emblematic of the ongoing dangers 
     faced by civilians in northern Gaza--even as Israel says it 
     is winding down its military mission there--and the depth of 
     their isolation from the outside world.
       Asked for comment multiple times, the Israel Defense Forces 
     said, ``We are unfamiliar with the incident described.'' The 
     Post provided specific coordinates and additional details to 
     the IDF on Tuesday morning and has not received a reply.
       In the operations room of the PRCS in Ramallah, the 
     landline was ringing. It was 2:28 p.m. Omar al-Qam, the lone 
     dispatcher on duty that day, picked up.
       From 2,000 miles away, in Frankfurt, Germany came the 
     steady voice of Mohammed Salem Hamada: ``My family members 
     are trapped in Gaza City,'' he told Omar. ``They were driving 
     a black Kia Picanto and the car was targeted. Some of the 
     people were killed inside.''
       Mohammed gave Omar the phone number for his 15-year-old 
     niece, Layan, who had

     called her uncle in southern Gaza to sound the alarm. The 
     uncle, struggling with patchy cell service, called his cousin 
     in Germany, hoping he could find help.
       The uncle relayed what Layan had told him: The Israeli army 
     had opened fire on the family's car. Her parents and all four 
     of her siblings were dead--Sana, 13, Raghad, 12, Mohammed, 11 
     and 4-year-old Sarah.
       Layan told her uncle she was bleeding. And that her cousin 
     Hind, 6, was the only other survivor.
       Omar, in Ramallah, called Layan. She sounded terrified.
       ``They are firing at us,'' she screamed into the phone. 
     ``The tank is next to me.''
       ``Are you hiding?'' he asked.
       Then came a burst of fire. Layan screamed. The line went 
     dead.
       In shock, Omar said he went to find his colleague, Rana 
     Faqih, in another room. He was trembling, she recalled.
       Rana said she walked him back to his chair in the dispatch 
     room and stood next to him as he dialed again.
       It was Hind who answered this time.
       ``Are you in the car now?'' he asked her.
       ``Yes,'' came the small voice on the other end.
       Rana took the phone, telling the 6-year-old she would stay 
     on the phone until help arrived. Hind's voice was so quiet, 
     it was impossible to make out her reply.
       ``Who are you with?'' Rana asked.
       ``With my family,'' Hind told her.
       Rana asked if she had tried to wake up her family. Hind 
     responded: ``I'm telling you they're dead.''
       Rana asked her how the car had been hit.
       ``A tank,'' Hind said. ``The tank is next to me . . . it's 
     coming towards me . . . it's very, very close.'' Rana's voice 
     was strong and clear and reassuring. Hind's was faint and 
     shaky. Rana urged her to keep talking. They prayed together. 
     Rana read to her from the Quran.
       Don't cry, she told the little girl, though Rana was also 
     fighting back tears.
       ``Don't be scared,'' she told Hind. ``They're not going to 
     hurt you . . . . Don't leave the car.''
       Minutes passed. Hind appeared to drop the phone. The 
     silences were longer now.
       ``If I could get you out I would,'' Rana said. ``We're 
     trying our very best.''
       Rana was crying now, but tried to keep her voice steady.
       ``Please come get me,'' Hind said. Again and again: ``Come 
     get me.''
       There was a distant rumble of fire in the background.
       ``Come get me,'' Hind repeated.
       Rana, 37, has been working in Crisis and Disaster 
     Management with PRCS since 2009. She had faced situations 
     like this before, she said, but never with a girl so young.
       Her colleagues had located the car in a neighborhood near 
     Al-Azhar University. Getting an ambulance there, inside a 
     closed military zone, would require permission from the IDF. 
     It was a process that involved multiple agencies, 
     communicating on unreliable phone lines. The dispatchers knew 
     it could take hours.
       ``We have received hundreds of calls from people who are 
     trapped,'' said Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for PRCS. 
     ``People just want help evacuating. Unfortunately we do not 
     have safe access.''
       Operators told The Post they reached out around 3 p.m. to 
     the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which 
     coordinates the safe passage of paramedics with COGAT--an arm 
     of the Israeli Defense Ministry. Fathi Abu Warda, an adviser 
     at the Palestinian Ministry of Health, confirmed receiving a 
     green light from COGAT to send an ambulance to the area. 
     COGAT did not respond to questions from The Post, referring 
     them to the IDF.
       The operators said they tried to stay focused on Hind. 
     Nisreen Qawwas, 56, the head of PRCS's mental health 
     department, took the lead.
       ``She practiced deep breathing exercises with us, and I 
     told her we would be with her, second by second,'' Nisreen 
     recalled.
       But Hind began to grow distant, Nisreen said, and hung up 
     multiple times, growing frustrated that no one had come for 
     her.
       Eventually, operators said they reached Hind's mother, who 
     was sheltering elsewhere in Gaza City, and patched her into 
     the call.
       ``Her mother's voice made a real difference,'' Nisreen 
     said. ``Every moment she said to her mother, `I miss you 
     momma.' ''
       Her mother told her, `You will be with me in a little while 
     and I will hug you,' '' Nisreen remembered.
       The Post was not able to reach Hind's mother in Gaza City, 
     where there is limited connectivity.
       At 5:40 p.m.--three hours after the phone had first rung in 
     Ramallah--the dispatchers said they got a call back from the 
     Palestinian Ministry of Health. The ministry told them they 
     had received permission to send paramedics to Hind. Israeli 
     authorities had provided a map for them to follow. PRCS 
     dispatched the nearest ambulance, 1.8 miles away, to the 
     scene with two paramedics.
       Nisreen said she tried to keep Hind engaged. They talked 
     about the sea and the sun and her favorite chocolate cake.
       But everyone could tell the little girl was fading. She 
     said her hand was bleeding, that there was blood on her body. 
     It was dark now. She was hungry, thirsty and cold, she told 
     her mother.
       Dispatchers said the paramedics radioed in as they neared 
     the vehicle. The team in Ramallah encouraged them to move 
     forward, slowly, Nisreen said.
       At that moment, dispatchers said, there was ``heavy 
     gunfire.'' The line with Hind was lost. Hind's last sentence, 
     Omar said, was ``Come and take me.''
       That was at 7 p.m. last Monday, a full week ago. There has 
     been no word from Hind or the ambulance crew since.

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. On the humanitarian front, millions of Palestinian 
civilians are desperately trying to cling to life as we speak here. I 
have met with the leaders of international humanitarian organizations 
who have operated in conflict zones around the world for decades and 
for decades. Every one of them--every one--has stated that their 
organizations have never--never--experienced a humanitarian disaster as 
dire and terrible as the world is witnessing in Gaza.
  That is why 5 weeks ago, Senator Merkley and I traveled to the Rafah 
border crossing between Egypt and Gaza to see for ourselves what was 
happening, to talk to people on the ground.
  What we saw and learned indicated that Palestinians--Palestinian 
civilians--are on the verge of starvation; that injured children are 
having their limbs amputated without anesthesia; that sewage continues 
to spill into the streets and contaminate the water supplies; and 
health officials are warning of the imminent outbreak of cholera and 
other diseases. Diseases like dysentery are already rampant, especially 
in kids.
  That is why last week, 25 U.S. Senators wrote to President Biden 
urging the administration to do more to push the Netanyahu coalition to 
allow more desperately needed assistance to reach innocent civilians in 
Gaza. We outlined five specific measures that need to be taken 
immediately.
  That was not the first time many of us wrote to President Biden to 
express our concerns about the conduct of the war in Gaza. We wrote to 
the President over 3 months ago, posing a series of questions, 
including what mechanisms are in place to ensure that U.S.-provided 
equipment is used in accordance with international humanitarian law? We 
did that because the United States is not a bystander in this conflict.
  Israel is the largest annual recipient of U.S. security assistance, 
totaling more than $39 billion over the last 10 years alone. And right 
now, bombs and artillery made in America and paid for by Americans are 
being used in Gaza. So the U.S. Government and the U.S. Senate has an 
obligation to the American people to ensure that their tax dollars, our 
tax dollars, are used in the manner that aligns with our values and 
aligns with our interests.
  That is why 19 Senators filed an amendment to the National Security 
Act, the supplemental national security provision that is before the 
Senate now and soon will be considered. That is why we filed an 
amendment to ensure that all recipients of U.S. military assistance in 
that bill--whether Ukraine, whether Israel, or whether it is one of our 
East Asian partners--use these U.S. taxpayer dollars in line with our 
values and our interests.
  Our amendment is designed to create an accountability structure to 
ensure that countries that receive U.S. security assistance promise to 
adhere to humanitarian law and other applicable law.
  It is designed to ensure that recipients of U.S. assistance promise 
to help facilitate and not arbitrarily restrict the delivery of U.S.-
supported humanitarian assistance in conflict zones.
  And our amendment included a provision to maintain accountability by 
requiring reporting be presented and provided to the Congress on 
whether or not the recipients of U.S. military assistance were, in 
fact, complying with those commitments on international law and 
allowing humanitarian aid to flow to conflict zones.
  Importantly, the reporting requirements in our amendment also require 
information and an assessment about whether recipient countries--
countries receiving U.S. military aid--are employing best practices to 
prevent civilian harm.
  That is what our amendment does. We filed that amendment to this bill 
just a few days ago. In the meantime, since we first proposed this 
amendment in December, we have remained in regular communication with 
the Biden administration.

[[Page S579]]

  I want to thank all of my colleagues who cosponsored this amendment, 
including the original cosponsors--Senator Kaine, Senator Durbin, and 
Senator Schatz--but also the 15 other colleagues, including the 
Presiding Officer who joined together in this effort to call for an 
amendment that made sure that we better align our military assistance 
with our values.
  Our amendment applied these requirements to every country receiving 
military assistance in the supplemental national security bill, but our 
intention all along has been to expand this worldwide, to make sure 
that as the United States uses taxpayer dollars to provide security 
assistance to countries around the world, that we can tell those 
taxpayers that their money is being used and the military equipment 
purchased with their money is being used in a manner consistent with 
our values.
  We began that conversation with the President's team at the White 
House. We had a chance to talk with them about our goals and the 
purposes of the amendment.
  At the time we introduced this amendment, we said our goal is to get 
these provisions implemented, whether through amendment or through 
other means.
  I want to salute the President of the United States--President 
Biden--because just last night, at 8:30 p.m., the President issued a 
historic national security memorandum, National Security Memorandum No. 
20.
  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the 
Record.

  National Security Memorandum on Safeguards and Accountability With 
      Respect to Transferred Defense Articles and Defense Services

       As outlined in National Security Memorandum 18 of February 
     23, 2023 (United States Conventional Arms Transfer Policy) 
     (NSM-18), supporting foreign partners of the United States 
     through appropriate transfers of defense articles by the 
     Department of State and the Department of Defense is a 
     critical tool for advancing United States foreign policy and 
     national security objectives, including to:
       (a) strengthen the collective security of the United States 
     and its allies and partners by enhancing interoperability and 
     supporting United States-led diplomacy in building and 
     maintaining international coalitions;
       (b) promote international peace and stability, and help 
     allies and partners deter and defend themselves against 
     aggression and foreign malign influence;
       (c) strengthen United States national security by 
     reinforcing respect for human rights, international 
     humanitarian law, democratic governance, and the rule of law;
       (d) prevent arms transfers that risk facilitating or 
     otherwise contributing to violations of human rights or 
     international humanitarian law; and
       (e) strengthen ally and partner capacity to respect their 
     obligations under international law and reduce the risk of 
     civilian harm, including through appropriate tools, training, 
     advising, and institutional capacity-building efforts that 
     accompany arms transfers. Equally critical is ensuring that 
     adequate safeguards and accountability exist with respect to 
     transferred defense articles and defense services. Under the 
     Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.), both the 
     Department of State and the Department of Defense implement 
     end-use monitoring programs.
       In addition, as a matter of policy, the United States 
     always seeks to promote adherence to international law and 
     encourages other states and partners to do the same. United 
     States policy, including as reflected in Executive Order 
     13732 of July 1, 2016 (United States Policy on Pre- and Post-
     Strike Measures to Address Civilian Casualties in U.S. 
     Operations Involving the Use of Force), is for executive 
     departments and agencies to engage with foreign partners to 
     share and learn best practices for reducing the likelihood of 
     and responding to civilian casualties, including through 
     appropriate training and assistance. In order to effectively 
     implement certain obligations under United States law, the 
     United States must maintain an appropriate understanding of 
     foreign partners' adherence to international law, including, 
     as applicable, international human rights law and 
     international humanitarian law. As a matter of international 
     law, the United States looks to the law of state 
     responsibility and United States partners' compliance with 
     international humanitarian law in assessing the lawfulness of 
     United States military assistance to, and joint operations 
     with, military partners.
       For these reasons, I am issuing this memorandum, which 
     requires the Secretary of State to obtain certain credible 
     and reliable written assurances from foreign governments 
     receiving defense articles and, as appropriate, defense 
     services, from the Departments of State and Defense, and 
     requires the Secretaries of State and Defense to provide 
     periodic congressional reports to enable meaningful 
     oversight. In addition to the requirements of this 
     memorandum, the Secretaries of State and Defense are 
     responsible for ensuring that all transfers of defense 
     articles and defense services by the Departments of State and 
     Defense under any security cooperation or security assistance 
     authorities are conducted in a manner consistent with all 
     applicable international and domestic law and policy, 
     including international humanitarian law and international 
     human rights law, the applicable ``Leahy Law'' (22 U.S.C. 
     2378d, 10 U.S.C. 362), and NSM-18.
       Section 1. Policy. (a) Except as provided below, the policy 
     outlined in this memorandum applies prospectively to the 
     provision to foreign governments by the Departments of State 
     or Defense of any defense articles funded with congressional 
     appropriations under their respective security assistance and 
     security cooperation authorities, including with Foreign 
     Military Financing and Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative 
     funds, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 333, and pursuant to 
     Presidential drawdown authority under section 506 of the 
     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2318). Prior to the 
     Departments of State or Defense providing such defense 
     articles to the recipient country and, as applicable, 
     consistent with the timelines set out in subsection (c) of 
     this section, the Secretary of State shall:
       (i) obtain credible and reliable written assurances from a 
     representative of the recipient country as the Secretary of 
     State deems appropriate that the recipient country will use 
     any such defense articles in accordance with international 
     humanitarian law and, as applicable, other international law; 
     and
       (ii) in furtherance of supporting section 6201 of the 
     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2378-1) and 
     applicable international law, obtain credible and reliable 
     written assurances from a representative of the recipient 
     country as the Secretary of State deems appropriate that, in 
     any area of armed conflict where the recipient country uses 
     such defense articles, consistent with applicable 
     international law, the recipient country will facilitate and 
     not arbitrarily deny, restrict, or otherwise impede, directly 
     or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States 
     humanitarian assistance and United States Government-
     supported international efforts to provide humanitarian 
     assistance.
       The assurances described in this subsection shall be 
     enforceable consistent with subsection (b) of this section.
       (b) Upon an assessment by the Secretary of State or the 
     Secretary of Defense that the credibility or reliability of 
     assurances provided by the recipient country as required by 
     subsection (a) of this section has been called into question 
     and should be revisited, the Secretary of State or the 
     Secretary of Defense, as appropriate, shall report to the 
     President, through the Assistant to the President for 
     National Security Affairs, within 45 days of such 
     assessment and shall indicate appropriate next steps to be 
     taken to assess and remediate the situation. Such 
     remediation could include actions from refreshing the 
     assurances to suspending any further transfers of defense 
     articles or, as appropriate, defense services.
       (c) Recognizing that a reasonable period of time is 
     necessary to obtain the assurances required by subsection (a) 
     of this section from foreign governments already receiving 
     such defense articles from the Departments of State or 
     Defense as of the date of this memorandum, the Secretary of 
     State shall obtain the required assurances from those 
     countries within the following time periods:
       (i) For any country to which subsection (a) of this section 
     applies and that is deemed by the Secretary of State to be 
     engaged, as of the date of this memorandum, in an active 
     armed conflict in which defense articles covered by this 
     section are used, the Secretary of State shall obtain the 
     assurances outlined in subsection (a) of this section not 
     later than 45 days after the date of this memorandum and 
     shall provide an update to the President, through the 
     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, 
     regarding the recipient countries that have provided such 
     assurances. If the Secretary of State does not obtain such 
     assurances within 45 days of the date of this memorandum, the 
     transfer of defense articles and, as applicable, defense 
     services, shall be paused until the required assurances are 
     obtained.
       (ii) For any country to which subsection (a) of this 
     section applies and that is not deemed by the Secretary of 
     State to be engaged, as of the date of this memorandum, in an 
     active armed conflict in which defense articles covered by 
     this section are used, the Secretary of State shall obtain 
     the assurances outlined in subsection (a) of this section not 
     later than 180 days after the date of this memorandum and 
     shall provide an update to the President, through the 
     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, 
     regarding the recipient countries that have provided such 
     assurances. If the Secretary of State does not obtain such 
     assurances within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, 
     the transfer of defense articles and, as applicable, defense 
     services, shall be paused until the required assurances are 
     obtained.
       (d) This memorandum does not apply to (1) air defense 
     systems; (2) other defense articles or defense services that 
     are intended to be used for strictly defensive purposes or 
     are exclusively for non-lethal purposes other than in armed 
     conflict; (3) defense articles or defense services that are 
     non-lethal in nature; or (4) transfers strictly for the 
     operational needs of the Department of Defense.

[[Page S580]]

       (e) This memorandum shall apply to the provision to foreign 
     governments by the Departments of State or Defense of any 
     defense services the Secretary of State or the Secretary of 
     Defense determines to be appropriate under their respective 
     authorities in furthering the aims of the policy outlined in 
     this memorandum.
       (f) in rare and extraordinary circumstances justified by an 
     imperative associated with the national security of the 
     United States, and with concurrent notification to the 
     President, including an articulation of the relevant 
     justification, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of 
     Defense may waive the requirements of this section. Such 
     waiver should be as limited in time, scope, and nature as 
     deemed necessary to advance the interests of United States 
     national security.
       Sec. 2. Congressional Reporting. (a) Not later than 90 days 
     after the date of this memorandum, and once every fiscal year 
     thereafter, the Secretaries of State and Defense shall report 
     in written form and, to the extent additionally appropriate, 
     through verbal briefings by appropriate senior officials of 
     their respective departments, to the Committee on Foreign 
     Relations, the Committee on Armed Services, and the Committee 
     on Appropriations of the Senate; the Committee on Foreign 
     Affairs, the Committee on Armed Services, and the Committee 
     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and, upon 
     request, other congressional national security committees as 
     appropriate. The written report shall address defense 
     articles and, as appropriate, defense services, provided by 
     the Departments of State or Defense described in subsections 
     1(a) and 1(e) of this memorandum, and shall include:
       (i) any new assurances obtained since the prior report;
       (ii) an assessment of any credible reports or allegations 
     that such defense articles and, as appropriate, defense 
     services, have been used in a manner not consistent with 
     international law, including international humanitarian law; 
     such assessment shall include any determinations, if they can 
     reasonably be made, as to whether use has occurred in a 
     manner not consistent with international law, and if so, 
     whether the recipient country has pursued appropriate 
     accountability;
       (iii) a description of the procedures used to make the 
     assessment described in subsection (a)(ii) of this section;
       (iv) an assessment and analysis of (1) any credible reports 
     indicating that the use of such defense articles and, as 
     appropriate, defense services, has been found to be 
     inconsistent with established best practices for mitigating 
     civilian harm, including practices that have been adopted by 
     the United States military, and including measures 
     implemented in response to the Department of Defense's 
     Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan or 
     incidents reviewed pursuant to the Department of State's 
     Civilian Harm Incident Response Guidance; and (2) the extent 
     to which efforts to induce effective implementation of such 
     civilian harm mitigation best practices have been 
     incorporated into the relevant United States security 
     assistance program;
       (v) a description of the procedures used to make the 
     assessment and analysis described in subsection (iv) of this 
     section:
       (vi) a description of any known occurrences of such defense 
     articles and, as appropriate, defense services, not being 
     received by the recipient foreign government that is the 
     intended recipient, or being misused for purposes 
     inconsistent with the intended purposes, and a description of 
     any remedies undertaken;
       (vii) an assessment and analysis of whether each foreign 
     government recipient has abided by the assurances received 
     pursuant to section 1(a)(ii) of this memorandum, whether such 
     recipient is in compliance with section 6201 of the Foreign 
     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2378-1), and whether such 
     recipient has fully cooperated with United States Government 
     efforts and United States Government-supported international 
     efforts to provide humanitarian assistance in an area of 
     armed conflict where the recipient country is using such 
     defense articles and, as appropriate, defense services; and
       (viii) a description of any challenges to conducting the 
     assessment and analysis described in subsections (a)(i)-(vii) 
     of this section, including whether or not there is available 
     information responsive to the subsections above.
       (b) The written report and, where applicable, accompanying 
     verbal briefing provided under subsection (a) of this section 
     shall be unclassified but may be supplemented, to the extent 
     necessary, with classified reporting as appropriate for the 
     protection of classified national security information.
       (c) The first report provided under this section shall 
     include available information on the use, since January 2023, 
     of defense articles and, as appropriate, defense services, 
     provided by the Departments of State or Defense described in 
     subsections 1(a) and 1(e) of this memorandum by recipient 
     countries that engaged in armed conflict during calendar year 
     2023.
       (d) The Secretaries of State and Defense shall notify the 
     congressional committees specified in subsection (a) of this 
     section within 7 days following any report provided to the 
     President pursuant to section 1(b) of this memorandum and 
     within 7 days following any notification provided to the 
     President of the exercise of a waiver pursuant to section 
     1(f) of this memorandum, and shall notify the same committees 
     of assurances newly received pursuant to section 1(a) of this 
     memorandum within 30 days of receiving such assurances if not 
     otherwise reported to the Congress within that time period.
       Sec. 3. Definitions. For purposes of this memorandum, the 
     terms ``defense article'' and ``defense service'' have the 
     meanings given in section 47 of the Arms Export Control Act, 
     22 U.S.C. 2794.
       Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. What this national security memorandum does is 
effectively implement the terms of our amendment. It makes the 
provisions of that amendment effectively the law of the land and does 
other things as well.
  I not only want to salute President Biden, I want to salute his 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the entire NSC team, and the 
entire White House team for taking this very important, deliberate, 
historic action. It is a very big deal.
  What does it do? As our amendment, it pushes forward in a number of 
big areas.
  First, it requires that every recipient of U.S. military assistance 
promise in writing, before receiving that military assistance, that 
they will comply with international humanitarian law and, as 
applicable, other international law. They have to promise in writing to 
do that before the delivery of U.S. military assistance.
  No. 2, it requires that every recipient of U.S. military assistance 
must promise in writing to facilitate and not to arbitrarily restrict 
the delivery of U.S.-supported humanitarian assistance into conflict 
zones where U.S. weapons are being used by the recipient country. That 
promise also has to be made before the delivery of that military 
assistance.
  And this national security memorandum has enforcement mechanisms to 
ensure compliance and to make sure that the U.S. Government has the 
tools to take action in cases of noncompliance.
  It focuses, in the first instance, on countries that are currently in 
armed conflict and using U.S. weapons. That would include Israel. It 
would include Ukraine. It would include other countries that today are 
using U.S. weapons in conflict zones.
  And it indicates that if those countries do not make these 
assurances, make these promises within the next 45 days, U.S. security 
assistance will be suspended.
  It also has a provision that says the Secretary of State will inform 
the President of the United States if there is any information that the 
recipient countries that have made these promises are not keeping those 
promises to the American people and the American taxpayer and when the 
Secretary of State makes such notification to the President, that 
Congress will be informed.
  The national security memorandum also has the robust reporting 
requirements included in our proposed amendment to help monitor 
compliance with the promises made by the recipient countries. They are 
promises to use U.S. military assistance in accordance with 
international humanitarian law and other international law as 
applicable. They are promises to facilitate and not arbitrarily 
restrict the delivery of humanitarian assistance.
  The report will tell the Congress whether or not those countries are, 
in fact, doing those things and provide an assessment of what is 
happening.
  The report will also include other provisions called for in our 
amendment. One of them, very importantly,

[[Page S581]]

is that the report must assess and analyze whether or not the recipient 
countries that are engaged in armed conflict are deploying and using 
best practices to prevent civilian harm. Let me say that again. This 
report will require an assessment and analysis of whether countries 
that are receiving U.S. military assistance, engaged in armed conflict 
now, whether or not they are employing best practices to prevent 
civilian harm.
  The national security memorandum prioritizes this reporting on 
countries that are currently using U.S. weapons in armed conflict. For 
those countries, the first report will be due in 90 days. Those 
countries include Ukraine, include Israel, and any other countries that 
are using U.S. weapons in armed conflict today.
  And, very importantly, the reporting period that is covered will be a 
reporting timeframe starting January of 2023. So Congress will receive 
a report in 90 days on whether or not the recipients of U.S. military 
assistance are in compliance throughout last year and on into this year 
with those requirements set out in the national security memorandum 
requirements that we had in our amendment.
  This really is a historic moment. This is a transformational moment 
in making sure we align U.S. security assistance with American values. 
It is a very sweeping memorandum.
  As of 8:30 p.m. last night, it is the law of the land in the United 
States of America. It will give the President of the United States many 
more tools and more leverage to better ensure that countries that are 
using U.S. military assistance comply with the commitments they now 
have to make in writing--whether it is Ukraine, whether it is Israel, 
whether it is another country.
  I spoke a little bit earlier about the fact that despite repeated 
requests from the Biden administration of the Netanyahu coalition to 
reduce the level of civilian casualties, to allow more humanitarian 
assistance into Gaza, that, for the most part, with some minor 
exceptions, those requests have fallen on deaf ears.
  So we hope and believe and are quite confident that this national 
security memorandum, which adopts our amendment, will provide the 
President with the leverage, additional leverage needed to close that 
gap between our request and reality.
  I urge the President and his team to make effective use of these new 
provisions.
  (Ms. BALDWIN assumed the Chair.)
  I urge the President's team to do that not just with respect to 
Israel but with any country that is receiving U.S. military assistance, 
because American taxpayers must be assured that the U.S. Government is 
doing everything in its power to make sure that as we provide 
assistance to partners around the world, that they are complying with 
their values and complying with the principles of adherence to 
international humanitarian law, international law, that they will help 
facilitate and not obstruct the delivery of humanitarian assistance to 
people in desperate need.
  I want to again thank all of the cosponsors of this amendment, 
because there were many people who opposed this amendment. But I never 
understood the opposition to the straightforward principles that U.S. 
taxpayer dollars and U.S. military assistance should go to countries 
that commit to us that they will use that help that we are providing in 
accordance with international humanitarian law and commit that if they 
are engaged in armed conflict using U.S. weapons, that they will 
support U.S. efforts and other U.S.-backed efforts to provide 
humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who are caught up in the 
crossfire through no fault of their own.
  These seem like very straightforward principles, and it is about time 
that we took what has previously really been the sentiment of the 
United States and turn it into substance, to take rhetoric and make it 
more of a reality.
  So I want to thank all my colleagues, including the new Presiding 
Officer, who helped make that happen.
  I want to thank the President of the United States. I want to thank 
President Biden, who has said from the beginning that the United States 
must continue to be a beacon of hope and that we must have a foreign 
policy based on values, based on the rule of law, based on human 
rights. If we want to do that, we need to make sure that our laws match 
those ambitions. We need to make sure that we have requirements on the 
books that achieve those aspirations because aspirations that are not 
backed up with real leverage sound good, but they are not made real in 
the world we live in.
  Thank you to all of the cosponsors to this amendment. Thank you to 
the President of the United States. This is an important new chapter in 
how the United States provides military assistance around the world and 
how we conduct our foreign policy, and I hope it will lead to a 
brighter chapter in the years ahead.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The senior Senator from Minnesota.
  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to 
pass the important national security package that is in front of us. 
This will reaffirm our Nation's commitment to our partners across the 
globe.
  Earlier this week, many of us felt very strongly that we should move 
forward on the combination of bills that Senator Lankford, Senator 
Murphy, and Senator Sinema had negotiated. I strongly supported that 
bipartisan compromise and worked with them on a portion of the bill 
regarding our Afghan allies who had served with our troops, and I was 
really impressed by the thorough nature of their negotiations.
  We know how important that bill was for our own national security. It 
would have given the President emergency authority to shut down the 
border when our border agents are overwhelmed. It would have made 
changes to our asylum system. It would have addressed processing issues 
and backlogs. It would have actually expanded legal immigration for 
things like work permits and visas.
  I am grateful that the package we are considering today does include 
the bipartisan bill that I am part of to declare fentanyl trafficking a 
national emergency and allow us to impose tough sanctions on criminal 
organizations and fentanyl supply chain hubs, but I will note that this 
bill--because the other piece of this regarding fentanyl was not 
actually included yet in this bill, that would be the resources that we 
need to crack down on fentanyl trafficking at our border and ports of 
entry.
  So not only was the bill that our colleagues sadly voted down good on 
giving the emergency authority to the President on the border to 
protect our own Nation's security--something they had been asking for--
but it also did a very important thing when it came to fentanyl.
  Why is this such a problem? In Hennepin County alone in the State of 
Minnesota, the sheriff recently seized enough fentanyl to kill every 
single person in that county--the biggest county in my State--and we 
are seeing similar things to that across our Nation.
  So what this bill would have done--the original bill would have 
done--with the negotiation is that it would have actually given modern-
day technology, cutting-edge technology to our ports of entry--all 
ports of entry, including airports and the like, including help we may 
need on the northern border, the Canadian border, when it comes to 
things like fentanyl. So that is why I hope that someday our colleagues 
will reconsider and join us in advocating for strong border security as 
well as for the work that needs to be done on the fentanyl epidemic.
  The original package, as we know, is not being considered, but we 
also know how important it is to go forward when it comes to our 
leadership around the world, whether that means standing with our 
allies after the terrorist attack in Israel, whether it means making 
sure that humanitarian aid gets to innocent people in Gaza and across 
the world, or whether it comes to Ukraine.
  I did want to spend some time talking about Ukraine, as I have been 
there a number of times in the last few

[[Page S582]]

years. The first time I went was actually with Senator McCain and 
Senator Graham during the first invasion back in January 2017. In fact, 
I spent New Year's Eve of 2016 on the border with Senator Graham and 
Senator McCain and the former President of Ukraine. It was there that I 
learned so much about the Ukrainian troops. Even back then, there were 
snipers killing the troops at unbelievable rates, but they kept going 
back to protect their own homeland.
  Fast-forward, of course, and we see an even more significant invasion 
by Vladimir Putin and Russia once again. Just as Vladimir Putin has 
shown his true colors, the Ukrainian people have shown theirs, 
defending their democracy in brilliant blue and yellow. They have 
succeeded in taking back a number of lands that the Russians have 
seized, and that is because of their unbreakable resolve, yes, but it 
is also because America took the lead, joined by dozens and dozens of 
allies across the world, from Japan to South Korea to Europe.
  Now is not the time to give up. In the words of the NATO Secretary 
General, the war has become a ``battle for ammunition.'' Russia is 
firing nearly 10,000 rounds a day, while Ukraine is only managing 
2,000. Our friends need our support more than ever.
  In my last visit to Ukraine, with Senator Portman in the middle of 
the war, we visited Irpin. We saw the bombed-out maternity wards and 
the apartment buildings reduced to rubble. We saw the mass graves. 
Those atrocities have been met, of course, with the resilience of the 
Ukrainian people: the chef cooking meals for the troops on the 
frontlines; the nurse who traded in scrubs for camo and now serves as a 
field medic; the martial arts teacher leading an 11-man recon unit to 
keep his village safe. Those are people who stood up, and our country 
must stand with that democracy.
  We must never forget President Zelenskyy's words on that worst 
evening in September, when everyone had counted them out, when all the 
pundits thought Russia would just roll over their country with their 
tanks and with their planes. What did President Zelenskyy do? He went 
down to the street corner and he said this. He said, ``We are here.'' 
Those simple words--``We are here.'' Well, that is our job now. We have 
to say the same thing--that we are here for them.
  U.S. aid has empowered the Ukrainian people to take back the 
territory that is rightfully theirs. It has saved lives. It has given 
families hope that there will be a future--but not if we turn our backs 
on them right now.
  Throughout our Nation's history, we have been there for free nations 
across the globe, and we must be there again. That gets to something 
that is not in the bill right now. It was in the original compromise 
agreement, and just like Ukraine, just like the Pacific, just like the 
help to Central Command and the help we must give given that our own 
troops are being attacked in the Middle East--it is the covenants we 
make.
  I am here talking about the Afghan refugees, 80,000 of them 
approximately in the United States. They served alongside our troops. 
They served as interpreters. They served as intel gatherers. They put 
their own lives and their families' lives at risk. And they have been 
here. They have been in the United States.
  That is why a bipartisan group of Senators have for now, sadly, years 
been working on a simple bill to make it clear that they are no longer 
in limbo. Many conservatives are supporting this bill.
  I am filing a bipartisan amendment--that was just filed--with Senator 
Moran. I thank him for his leadership as the ranking Republican on the 
Veterans' Committee and for joining me on this bill, along with Senator 
Graham, who is a longtime lead author of our base bill on the Afghan 
refugees. Again, Senator Graham, ranking member on the Judiciary 
Committee; Senator Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, ranking lead 
Republican on the Armed Services Committee, is filing this amendment 
with me; Senator Cassidy; Senator Mullin; Senator Tillis; Senator 
Murkowski; Senator Crapo; Senator Rounds; Senator Capito; Senators 
Coons and Blumenthal and many other Democrats as well.

  We have that magic number to get over what we call our 60-vote 
threshold. We will win this vote, but we will win more than a vote if 
we are allowed to advance this amendment by both sides as they 
negotiate which amendments go forward. We will be more than just 
getting a vote; we will be standing up for keeping our covenants.
  I am thinking of the people I have met, the Afghans, over the last 
year, the women I met with who served in the Afghan national army's 
Female Tactical Platoon. Our troops relied heavily on this platoon 
during the war. As our soldiers pursued missions hunting down ISIS 
combatants in unforgiving terrain and freeing prisoners from the grip 
of the Taliban, these women had their backs. They worked with our 
military's support team and facilitated discussions between our 
soldiers and the Afghan women whom they crossed paths with in the 
field.
  After the war, they and so many others fled Afghanistan to build a 
safer, brighter future in America. One of the platoon's commanders even 
said that once she gets her green card, her plan is to join the U.S. 
Army. That is right. Even knowing everything she sacrificed for our 
country, leaving her family behind, putting herself in peril, she would 
do it all over again if we gave her the chance. I am in awe of her grit 
and her patriotism. Unfortunately--and this is a big 
``unfortunately''--she and countless others like her are living in 
limbo, and it is our turn to do right by the people who stood with us.
  When the Hmong and the Vietnamese came to this country--I know this 
well because my State has a very large Hmong population--we didn't 
leave them in limbo and tell them: Well, you are standing here on the 
ground in the United States of America after helping us out, but there 
is a trapdoor under you because every year you have to reapply, and you 
don't know what is really going to happen if you have to go back.
  Are we going to send these people who stood with our troops back to 
the arms of the Taliban or are we going to do what is right?
  This bill, which I have worked on with numerous Republican leaders, 
has a heavy-duty vetting--vetting--process. And I remind my colleagues 
that the vast majority of these people are here already. They are on 
our soil. We already know what they have been doing. In fact, we know 
that one of them, sadly, was murdered--an interpreter who was working 
as a driver late at night in the State of Virginia. I don't know if 
that is what he would have been doing if he wasn't in limbo. But that 
happened on our soil.
  So all we are saying is that they be vetted and that they be able to 
get out of this legal limbo and treated with the respect they deserve.
  Time and time again, our Nation's history has shown us that people 
who stand with us in combat don't diminish America; they strengthen 
America.
  Our effort has earned the support of more than 60 organizations, 
including With Honor Action; including No One Left Behind; including 
Operation Recovery; the American Legion--was just with them yesterday 
as Senator Moran and I and Coons and Blumenthal and others discussed 
this bill; the VFW--this is a major priority for the VFW; as well as 
some of the Nation's most revered military leaders who have lent their 
names.
  At one point earlier last year, I went through hundreds of names of 
generals, retired generals who led our troops in times of war who 
support this bill, but today I mention Mike Mullen, ADM Mike Mullen, 
William McRaven, and Generals Richard Myers of the Air Force, Joseph 
Dunford from the Marine Corps, and Stanley McChrystal from the Army.
  Maybe we should listen to them when we think about how we treat those 
who saved the lives of our troops, how we must keep our covenants 
because in the next conflict when we are standing up for democracies or 
standing up for American interests, what do you think people are going 
to say if they think they help our country, and our troops make 
literal, individual promises to them, and then they come back, and they 
don't know what is going to happen to them? Some of them are in hiding 
right now across the world because they know that they or their 
families will be killed if this continues.
  We have built such a broad coalition of support because Americans 
from

[[Page S583]]

across the political spectrum agree that it is our moral obligation.
  When I am at home, vets come up to me--as I know they do to you, 
Madam President--they come up to me about all kinds of things; they 
always have: about their service, about their benefits, about what is 
happening with healthcare and burn pits. And we have advanced so many 
things to help them. But I have never seen anything more emotional for 
our soldiers that have served in Afghanistan than this, because they 
know the people that saved their lives and stood with them deserve 
better than this.
  What we are asking for is a vote on this bipartisan amendment, and we 
know we can pass this amendment because we have enough sponsors on it 
to pass this amendment. This is the perfect bill. Why? Because it is a 
national security package. It is about our national security. It is 
about that; it is about standing with our partners; and, most of all, 
it is about showing the world when the United States of America makes a 
promise, makes a covenant, we keep it.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Vermont.
  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, one of the worst humanitarian disasters 
in modern history is now unfolding before our eyes in Gaza today--right 
now. And we, as the government of the United States, are complicit.
  It has been 4 months since Hamas's terrorist attack started this war, 
and what we in Congress do right now could well determine whether tens 
of thousands of people live or whether they die. Already, the human 
costs of this Israel-Hamas war has been staggering. Madam President, 
1,200 innocent Israelis were killed in the initial terrorist attack, 
and more than 100 are still being held hostage.
  And as I have said many times, Israel has the right to defend itself 
against Hamas terrorism, but it does not have the right to go to war 
against the entire Palestinian people. As of today, Israel's response 
has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians and injured more than 67,000--
two-thirds of whom are women and children. Let me repeat: Two-thirds 
are women and children.
  Madam President, 1.7 million Palestinians have been driven from their 
homes, and, unbelievably, some 70 percent of the housing units in Gaza 
have been damaged or destroyed. This is an unheard of level of 
destruction--80 percent of people driven from their homes and 70 
percent of housing units damaged or destroyed.
  And while 1.7 million people are displaced from their homes, they 
have no idea where they will be tomorrow or whether or not they will 
ever return to their homes. And many of these men, women, and children 
have been displaced multiple times. They go here; they go there; they 
go there.
  Most of the infrastructure in Gaza has been destroyed. Very few water 
wells or bakeries are functioning. The electricity has been cut since 
the beginning of the war. Sewage is running into the streets. Cell 
phone service is spotty or nonexistent. Most of the healthcare 
facilities in Gaza are not operational. Bombs falling, people getting 
hurt; and yet healthcare facilities not operational. Many facilities 
have been damaged in air strikes, and numerous, numerous healthcare 
workers trying to keep children alive have been killed. The facilities 
that are operational today lack the basic medical supplies that heroic 
doctors and nurses need in order to save lives and treat their 
patients.
  And as horrible as all of this is, let me tell you what is even 
worse. As a result of Israeli bombing and restrictions on aid entering 
Gaza, only a tiny fraction of the food, water, medicine, and fuel that 
is needed--desperately needed--can get into Gaza. Even then, very 
little of that aid can reach beyond the immediate area of Rafah near 
the Egyptian border.
  And let us be very clear and take a deep breath and understand what 
all of this means. It means that, today, hundreds of thousands of 
children are starving and lack clean drinking water. The United Nations 
says the entire population of Gaza is at imminent risk of famine, and 
some 378,000 people are starving right now. According to the U.N., 1 in 
10 children under the age of 5 in Gaza is now acutely malnourished.

  And when malnutrition impacts young children, it often means 
permanent physical and cognitive damage that will impact them for the 
rest of their lives. In other words, if food got in tomorrow, 
healthcare got in tomorrow, damage has already been severely done to 
tens of thousands of beautiful, innocent little children. If nothing 
changes, we will soon have hundreds of thousands of children literally 
starving to death before our very eyes.
  And, unbelievably, that situation could even get worse in the 
immediate future. Roughly 1.4 million people--more than half of the 
population of Gaza--are now squeezed into the Rafah area. That is right 
up against the Egyptian border. Rafah was a town of just 250,000 before 
the war. It is a very small area, roughly 10 miles by 4 miles. Most of 
the people there are now packed into crowded U.N. shelters or sleeping 
out in tents. It is a daily struggle for them to find food or water.
  Yet Prime Minister Netanyahu, the leader of Israel's extreme-right 
wing government, says that Israel will soon launch a major ground 
offensive against Rafah, where all of these people currently are. He 
will soon be forcing hundreds of thousands of desperate people to 
evacuate once again. In other words, exhausted, traumatized, and hungry 
families will be driven onto the road with no plan as to where they 
will go, how they will receive essential supplies or protection for 
their physical safety.
  I cannot find words to describe how horrific this situation is and 
could become. Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly said that the 
goal of Israel's military efforts is total victory. Yet asked recently 
what total victory would look like, he responded chillingly by saying 
that it is like smashing a glass ``into small pieces, and then you 
continue to smash it into even smaller pieces and you continue hitting 
them.''
  And the question that we as Americans and as the U.S. Congress must 
ask is: How many more children and innocent people will be smashed by 
Netanyahu in this process? It is quite clear that beyond total 
destruction of Gaza, Netanyahu has no plan.
  Yesterday, President Biden acknowledged the severity of this crisis, 
and I thank him for doing that. He said that Israel's response in Gaza 
``has been over the top'' and added that ``there are a lot of innocent 
people who are starving. There are a lot of innocent people who are in 
trouble and dying. And it's got to stop.'' That is President Joe Biden.
  President Biden is absolutely right. It does have to stop. It has to 
now, and that is in our hands. President Biden and Secretary of State 
Blinken have been trying to negotiate an agreement where Israel pauses 
its military operation while Hamas releases the remaining hostages. All 
of us hope that this deal comes together. We all want the hostages 
freed and the slaughter ended. But Netanyahu is resisting this 
proposal. In large part, this is because he is politically weak at 
home. Most Israelis likely blame him for creating this crisis. And in 
my view--my view--he is trying to prolong the war to avoid facing 
accountability for his actions.
  Netanyahu didn't even wait for Secretary Blinken to leave the region 
this week before he publicly dismissed the hostage deal as delusional 
and brushed aside United States' concerns about expanding the ground 
offensive in southern Gaza. The Associated Press called this a 
``virtual slap in the face'' to Blinken and the United States--a 
virtual slap in the face--and they are right.
  Unbelievably--unbelievably--despite all of this, the U.S. Congress is 
prepared to spend another $14 billion on military aid to Netanyahu's 
rightwing government--$14 billion more, and 10 billion of this money is 
totally unrestricted and will allow Netanyahu to buy more of the bombs 
he has used to flatten Gaza and to kill thousands and thousands of 
children.
  This is American complicity at its worst, and it is really quite 
unbelievable. Does the U.S. Congress really want to provide more 
military aid to Netanyahu so that he can annihilate thousands and 
thousands more men, women, and children? Do we really want to reward 
Netanyahu, even while he ignores virtually everything the President of 
the United States is asking him to do? Do we want to give even more 
support to the leader of the most

[[Page S584]]

rightwing government in Israel's history, a man who has dedicated his 
political career to killing the prospects of a two-state solution?
  That is really hard to believe, but that is exactly what this 
legislation before us will do. And what is even harder to understand is 
that in the midst of this horrendous humanitarian crisis, the 
legislation before us contains a prohibition to funding for UNRWA, the 
largest U.N. agency operating in Gaza and the backbone of the 
humanitarian aid operation. Israel's allegations against the agency are 
serious, and they are being investigated seriously. But you don't 
starve 2 million children and people and women--you don't starve 2 
million people because of the alleged actions of 12 UNRWA employees.

  The whole world is watching. Netanyahu is starving the children of 
Gaza. We cannot be complicit in this atrocity. As long as this bill 
contains money to fund Netanyahu's cruel war, I will do everything I 
can to oppose it, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Alaska.
  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I want to talk about some of the 
important issues that we are debating here on the Senate floor. 
Actually, they are quite important, and we are having a good debate. I 
want to just talk about some of the votes that we have taken in the 
last couple of days.
  We voted on what I think was termed--really focused on--the Senate's 
border bill. A lot of people worked hard on that. I know the Presiding 
Officer did and Senator Lankford.
  I did not vote to proceed to consider that bill. There are a whole 
host of reasons. I think the most important, from my perspective, was 
this administration--the Biden administration--came in and said: We are 
going to have a policy of full open borders--which they have. There is 
no doubt about that. Every American knows it, sees it. It impacts 
people in Alaska negatively--over 300,000 illegal immigrants in 
December, an alltime record, and on track for 10 million.
  In my view, the border bill did not go far enough, and it is hard to 
trust the administration, even on provisions that we would want them to 
enforce, given their disastrous record for the last 3 years. So I was a 
no on that.
  Then we turned to the national security supplemental. I want to talk 
a lot about that this afternoon because it is very important. I voted, 
actually, to proceed to the debate, to start debating--hopefully, 
amending--this important bill.
  It is being called many things. Some are calling it the Ukraine bill, 
the Ukraine aid bill, the Israel bill. Having read it, having worked 
hard over the last 4 to 5 months to actually shape it, I think it 
should have a different name, maybe this name: the fighting 
authoritarian aggression national security bill. But probably the best 
title for this piece of legislation that we are now debating should be 
the national security industrial base renaissance bill.
  I hope my colleagues take a look at it. I hope they read it. But I am 
going to explain why I think it should be called that, and then we are 
obviously going to have a good debate on this bill.
  I am hoping that this bill--and I have mentioned this to my 
Republican colleagues, in particular--when people look at it and we 
debate it and try to make it better here on the floor, that it will 
unify the Republican conference, and, at the end, hopefully, get more 
support, because I think there is an important reason.
  There are a lot of reasons why I think this can unify Members of the 
Senate, Members of the Republican conference. First, let me just go 
into one of the most obvious, which I think almost everybody agrees 
with. If you don't, maybe you are not reading the news. But we are in a 
real dangerous period, led by this guy--this new era of authoritarian 
aggression, as I call it, where you have dictatorships on the march, 
very aggressive. That is Xi Jinping, the dictator of China. They are 
going through the biggest peacetime buildup in world history of their 
military--biggest peacetime buildup ever, of any country ever.
  I keep close tabs on what the Chinese are doing. This guy likes to 
dress up in fatigues. He is an aggressive, authoritarian dictator, 
working very closely with Putin; working very closely with the 
ayatollahs, the terrorists in Tehran; working very closely with Kim 
Jong Un, the dictator in North Korea.
  These dictatorships are all working together. I won't go into all of 
it, but if you go to Armed Services hearings and Intel hearings, they 
are working closely together, and they are willing to use military 
force, particularly against their democratic neighbors, either directly 
or through proxies--like Hamas, when they invaded Israel--to try to 
undermine American interests and those of our allies. That is 
happening.
  We are in one of the most dangerous periods since World War II right 
now. That is one reason that a bill like this should unify us.
  Another is that our industrial base in the United States has 
dramatically withered, particularly in its ability to protect us. What 
do I mean by ``protect us''? To produce weapons systems, to produce 
ammunition. Again, this is a fact. If you don't believe that, well, 
maybe you should do a little more research.
  Our industrial base is withering. It is a shadow of its former self 
during the Cold War, certainly, during previous wars.
  Mr. President, let me just give you an example. You know a lot about 
submarines. We are supposed to be building 1.2 Virginia-class subs a 
year. That is our goal. We can barely build one a year. This is making 
our sub fleet, which is one of our greatest asymmetric advantages over 
this guy, shrink.
  Even worse, 37 percent of our attack submarine fleet--that is about 
18 subs--are in maintenance or idle or awaiting maintenance, just 
sitting there because we don't have the industrial capacity to maintain 
our submarine base. Anyone who studies this knows this is a giant, 
giant problem.

  We all know this. If the bullets start flying, if a dictator like 
this launches a war against one of our allies, or Putin does or Iran 
does--they are trying to sink U.S. ships in the Red Sea right now, 
anyway, literally troops under attack--when the bullets are flying, 
that is not the time you need to build up your industrial base. So if 
we are in a real dangerous period, which we are, and the American 
ability, in terms of our industrial base, to protect our own country 
has withered, which it has, that is another reason we should be 
thinking: Let's do something about it.
  A third reason the people on my side of the aisle should be taking 
this legislation seriously is that it is an opportunity to make up for 
what has been an incredibly weak Biden administration approach to 
national security. I talk about this a lot, but this administration is 
not serious about national security. The President has put forward 
three times in his budget each year Department of Defense cuts, 
inflation-adjusted cuts. He will crank up the EPA and the Department of 
the Interior 20, 25, 30 percent. The DOD, every year, Joe Biden cuts 
it.
  The current budget shrinks the Army, shrinks the Navy, shrinks the 
Marine Corps. Do you think he is impressed by that? He is not.
  In next year's budget, the Biden budget will bring the United States 
below 3 percent of GDP on military spending. It is probably the fourth 
or fifth time we have been below 3 percent in 80 years. Do you think he 
is impressed with that? He is not.
  We have an administration, led by civilians at the Pentagon, who are 
not focused on lethality, who are not focused on warfighting, who have 
been distracted by some of these far-left social issues, which, in my 
view, have no business being in the Pentagon with our warfighters.
  So this bill that we are debating right now is a chance to start a 
course correction in the dangerous world we are facing because of 
dictators like this and the very weak response of the Biden 
administration's approach to national security and defense, which they 
have always--go look at the budgets--always prioritized dead last of 
any Federal Agency.
  So what does it do? Let's take a look. This is from an article from 
the Washington Post based on a study by the American Enterprise 
Institute on what this supplemental--this is actually where it was in 
November--what this does.

[[Page S585]]

  I think the most important point that I want to emphasize here is 
that this bill is primarily focused on rebuilding our military 
industrial base in this new era of authoritarian aggression. That is 
the principal focus.
  Over half of the dollars that are in this bill--over half, over $50 
billion--go directly to America's capacity, our capacity in States all 
across this great Nation, mostly in the Midwest and on the east coast, 
some out in California, to build weapons, to build ammo, and to be 
ready for war if it comes--over $50 billion. There will be thousands 
and thousands of jobs created by these direct investments in America.
  This is a generational investment in our ability to defend ourselves. 
What do I mean by ``generational''? Some of these investments we will 
see 15 or 20 years from now, hopefully, still producing weapons, 
submarines.
  Let me just give you a few examples. Let's start with submarines. Our 
greatest comparative advantage, relative to China--they are catching up 
in a whole host of areas, but not in terms of subs. This has $3 billion 
to go directly into the American submarine industrial capacity, which 
will unlock another $3 billion from our AUKUS agreement with Australia. 
That is $6 billion to our industrial base for submarines. There is $5 
billion for 155 artillery shells; over half a billion for counter-UAS 
systems. On the other weapons systems, this is directly invested in 
America--Patriots, GMLRS, Javelins, Harpoons, Tomahawks, HARMs, TOW 
missiles--built by Americans for our defense.
  Do you get the picture? Over $50 billion of this bill will go 
directly into our industrial base to defend ourselves. Working-class 
Americans, America's national security will benefit.
  This is replenishing our weapons stocks, our ammunition stocks, for 
the U.S. military and, yes, for our allies to purchase, some of whom 
are at war today--Ukraine, of course, and Israel.
  Now, there is a lot of focus on Ukraine and a lot of arguments about 
whether to provide continued lethal aid. I strongly support that. But 
this bill also focuses on other allies, which, like I said, in the 
Republican conference, I believe unifies us. Ukraine has been a debate. 
But let me start with Israel.
  I have been out to Israel twice in the last year, including about 10 
days after the October 7 attacks, with a bipartisan group of Senators. 
It is, obviously, our most important ally in the Middle East--one of 
our most important allies in the world.
  Here is what I think a lot of people miss. Right now, if you go 
there, you will see it; you will feel it; you will understand it. 
Israel is under an existential threat to the very existence of their 
State and their people, as clear as day--Iran, all the proxies, Hamas, 
Hezbollah, the Houthis. This is not an exaggeration.
  This Defense bill has close to $17 billion for Israel in U.S. forces, 
in U.S. Central Command, that, right now, are being attacked--right 
now: Iron Dome, David's Sling, interceptors--about 2\1/2\ billion for 
CENTCOM operations for our U.S. Forces, who are literally taking 
missiles from the Houthis right now on Navy ships in the Red Sea. I 
think everybody agrees: You have to fund our troops.
  Let me give you another area that I think unifies us; should unify 
all Senators; I think it unifies a lot of Republicans. And that is 
Taiwan and INDOPACOM.
  Taiwan has been kind of--not kind of--a big focus of mine throughout 
my career. I just retired from the U.S. Marine Corps last week, 
actually, as a colonel, after 30 years of service. My first deployment 
as a U.S. Marine was to the Taiwan Strait in 1995 and `96. Two carrier 
strike groups and a Marine amphibious ready group that I was a young 
infantry officer on, we were there as a U.S. commitment when the PLA 
was threatening to invade Taiwan. That is called the third Taiwan 
Strait crisis. It was their first Presidential election. American 
commitment was there.
  I finished out my Marine Corps time as the chief of staff with the 
Marine Force's Pacific Command, which is a whole focus on Taiwan. The 
first time I ever visited Taiwan as a U.S. Senator, I will never 
forget. A number of Senators were there. We got on the bus. The head of 
our AIT embassy, essentially--not really an embassy, unofficial 
embassy--he welcomed us, an American citizen: Welcome to Taiwan. One of 
the most dynamic economies, one of the most vibrant democracies on the 
planet. And the only reason it exists today is because of the 
commitment of the U.S. military and America. For eight decades, we have 
kept Taiwan free.
  The initial supplemental that came up to the Senate, it didn't have a 
lot for Taiwan or INDOPACOM. A number of us knew why. President Biden 
was getting ready to meet with President Xi Jinping. They didn't want 
to ruin the mood music at that meeting, so they didn't put much in to 
defend Taiwan--help us defend Taiwan--as the Taiwan Relations Act 
requires. So a number of us worked together--Senator Collins, in 
particular, and my office. This bill has about $16.4 billion for 
INDOPACOM relevant munitions, security assistance, capacity expansion 
to deter China in the Taiwan Strait and throughout the INDOPACOM 
theater.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the list to be printed in 
the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

    The Supplemental Includes More Than $16.4 Billion for INDOPACOM-
  Relevant Munitions, Security Assistance, and Capacity Expansion To 
                    Bolster Deterrence Against China

       $3.9 billion in security assistance to Indo Pacific allies 
     and partners.
       Unlocking Taiwan Assistance. $1.9 billion to replenish U.S. 
     military stocks so DOD can transfer existing equipment and 
     weapons on hand to Taiwan using Presidential Drawdown 
     Authority provided in the FY23 NDAA. This is the quickest way 
     to arm Taiwan for its own self-defense.
       Indo-Pacific Foreign Military Financing. $2 billion for 
     partners and allies in the Indo-Pacific to purchase U.S. 
     defense articles, services, and training.
       $542 million for INDOPACOM unfunded requirements.
       $134 million for campaigning and Joint Training, Exercise 
     and Experimentation.
       $49 million for Joint Training Team Taiwan.
       $25 million for Joint Task Force Micronesia.
       $19 million for Joint Experimentation and Innovation.
       $51 million for operationalizing near-term space control.
       $147 million for Guam defense system.
       $117 million for Persistent Targeting for Undersea.
       $132 million for cruise missile motor capacity expansion 
     that is chokepoint for long-range missiles such as Harpoon, 
     Tomahawk, LRASM, and JASSM.
       $3.3 billion to enhance the submarine industrial base in 
     support of AUKUS and U.S. submarine production, including 
     $282M for military construction.
       $250 million for Treasury to provide a credible alternative 
     to China's coercive financing practices.
       The following defense investments funded in other 
     categories of the supplemental (e.g. Ukraine, Israel, Central 
     Command) also benefit INDOPACOM.
       $2.7 billion to expand domestic production capacity of 
     INDOPACOM-relevant munitions.
       $755 million to increase production capacity for PATRIOT 
     air defense missiles.
       $158 million for solid rocket motor capacity expansion, a 
     key components for numerous missiles relied upon by the U.S. 
     military.
       $199 million to expand industrial capacity for energetics, 
     precision bombs, and batteries.
       $1.6 billion to increase production capacity of 155mm 
     artillery rounds and components to reach 100K rounds per 
     month by the end of FY2025. Taiwan uses 155mm rounds.
       $5.6 billion to increase U.S. inventories of INDOPACOM-
     relevant munitions.
       $2.65 billion for additional munitions to include air 
     defense and anti-tank weapons.
       $915 million to replenish and modernize anti-radar HARM 
     missiles.
       $550 million to max out production of long-range precision 
     artillery rockets (GMLRS).
       $1.5 billion to procure 600K artillery rounds, a key 
     capability for U.S. Forces Korea.

  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, these are areas that I think can unify 
us: industrial base, workers, Taiwan, Israel. Like any bill, there are 
things in here I don't like: too much direct support to Ukraine, direct 
budget support. I think the European Union--Europeans--should be doing 
that, not us. Senator Collins did a good job of limiting that. It still 
has too much.
  If we have an amendment process here, I have an amendment that would 
strip that. Focus on lethal aid, not budget support where the Europeans 
can do that. There are other amendments out here to enhance what we 
give our allies.
  President Biden's team recently said we are not going to send any 
more LNG to Asia or Europe.

[[Page S586]]

  I just spoke with a very senior European elected official who thinks 
that is a real bad idea. We have an amendment that said you can't do 
that, Mr. President. We have to send energy to our allies. So there is 
a lot more we can do to improve this bill.
  I will end with this. You know, one of the arguments against this 
bill will say: Well, you know what, we don't have to do anything in 
Ukraine; we will let Putin roll. But we will be real strong in Taiwan. 
We will be real strong all over the rest of the world. We will deter 
these authoritarians there; don't worry so much about Ukraine.
  But, as you know, that is not really how the world works. It is not 
how the world works. Deterrence is not divisible. American credibility 
is not divisible. You can't say we are going to be real strong in the 
Taiwan Strait, but, you know, no problem in Ukraine or with Israel.
  These authoritarians are working together, and we need a strategic 
response through this very dangerous period. And how do we know 
deterrence is not divisible? I think the Biden administration 
demonstrated it with their botched withdrawal from Afghanistan.
  When that happened, a number of us, myself included, said: Watch. 
Watch. The authoritarian regimes around the world are going to test. 
They are going to probe. They are going to go into different areas and 
press. And, of course, that happened. I don't think you have the 
Ukraine invasion by Russia without the botched Afghanistan withdrawal.
  But, again, what I am trying to do here with my colleagues--Democrats 
and Republicans--is say: It is not a perfect bill. I want to amend it. 
I certainly hope we can get to an amendment process. I know a lot of 
people want to get to that. But there is a lot in this bill--more than 
half dedicated to American industrial base, billions dedicated to 
Taiwan, billions dedicated to Israel--that I think should unite us. And 
I am hopeful that is going to happen.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.
  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, there have been a lot of discussions over the 
last few days about a bill--a bill many months in the making; a bill 
that has been discussed, debated, and drafted, largely in secret. We 
saw it for the first time Sunday evening, at 7 p.m. eastern time.
  That bill has a lot of material in it. As it was released to us 
Sunday night, it spent somewhere just shy of $120 billion. Since then, 
it has gone through some changes. It now spends just a little under 
$100 billion, about $95 billion. And it has been modified. Its scope 
has been narrowed.
  I want to talk, first, just for a few minutes about how we got here 
or where we are in that process and then about some concerns I have 
with the bill as it now stands.
  Last fall--the fall of 2023--there was a push spearheaded primarily 
by the White House but a push that included most Senate Democrats and 
some Senate Republicans--a push to get more aid to Ukraine.
  Now, remember, the total aid the United States has spent on Ukraine 
throughout the duration of this conflict is somewhere in the 
neighborhood of $113, $114 billion. It is an enormous amount of money. 
The military aid component of that itself--at least until fairly 
recently--was more than the military aid provided by any other country 
or any other group of countries. It is an enormous sum of money.
  All of this is going on at the same time that the American people are 
enduring some challenges--challenges that relate to an economy in which 
the dollar can purchase less and less every day. This is the 
inevitable, foreseeable, and, in fact, foreseen and widely warned of 
consequence of a government--this government based here in Washington, 
DC--that has been spending too much money for many years, that has been 
spending money to the tune of trillion-dollar and then multitrillion-
dollar deficits year after year after year.
  This has happened, by the way, not during a widespread economic 
depression but, really, during the top of an economic cycle in which 
most of the last few years, unemployment has been really low.
  These are not things that the government has borrowed to spend more 
money on because of the fact that the economy has been severely 
sluggish and, therefore, unable to produce as much output as we would 
normally hope to have. No, this is just regular government spending run 
amok at the peak of the economic cycle.
  And as a result of this spending--this spending that has involved 
multitrillion-dollar deficits for the last few years, including and 
especially during this Presidential administration--that many years of 
adding that much debt to our already gargantuan national debt, which 
now stands above $34 trillion, those things have a consequence. When we 
add that much debt--especially that much debt that quickly--because of 
the way in which the acquisition of new debt works in the United 
States, it has the same basic effect on the economy as just printing 
more money. Essentially, what is happening here is that we are 
contributing to the money supply; we have turned up the pace at which 
we are contributing to the money supply; and as a result, every dollar 
buys less.
  How much less? Well, depending on which study you point to, a very 
conservative estimate is that the average American household has to 
spend about $1,000 a month every single month to buy the same basket of 
goods and services of basic necessities--from housing to healthcare, 
from gas to groceries--$1,000 a month more every single month to buy 
just the same basic necessities that they were buying prior to the day 
President Biden took office. And that is not very long. That does 
produce an effect. And it produces a type of misery that looks 
something like the following. Now, if people are on a salary, one way 
or another, it is a relatively fixed budget that most households 
operate on and, usually, a relatively fixed sum of money that they have 
to live on, whether that is through a salary or through a combination 
of sources, if they are independent contractors or if they are retired 
and live on a pension or something like that.
  So that sum of money now has to take into account that everything 
costs about $1,000 a month more for basic necessities every single 
month, working out to about $12,000 a year. For some families, this may 
be more; for some, it may be a little less. But everyone is feeling the 
pinch. It is what happens with inflation. It hurts everyone. But it 
hurts the poor, middle-class Americans more than anybody else.
  Rich people, interestingly enough, can find a way to get even richer, 
even faster, during times of great inflation. So it is one of many 
reasons why we ought to be concerned anytime we are going to spend a 
significant sum of money--a significant sum of money that is in 
addition to the ordinary operations of this government, the Federal 
Government--the government based right here in Washington, DC.
  That is why it is important to think about what we are spending, how 
we are spending it, why we are spending it, and what consequences that 
spending might have.
  For many of these same reasons, when this latest push to provide tens 
of billions of additional dollars over to Ukraine a few months ago, a 
number of Republicans, a number of Members--mostly Republicans, 
including Republicans in the Senate and Republicans in the House of 
Representatives--expressed concern over doing that. There was a wide 
range of concerns expressed. And I won't attempt to enumerate all of 
them. But I will just say that most of them followed along a few 
things. No. 1--the one that I just mentioned--inflation. The fact that 
we are spending a lot more money than we have, that causes inflation to 
become worse. The more we add to that dumpster fire, the more misery 
inflation is likely to create.
  No. 2, this money is going to a war, a war half a world away, to 
which we have already contributed substantially. We have European 
allies that are much closer to the action--European allies that have 
provided some aid, provided far less military aid than we have; who 
have not been as quick to defend their own backyard turf as we would 
like and not nearly as quick to defend their turf as we have been as a 
country.
  This matters. This matters in a number of ways. Remember, many of 
these allies of which I speak that are much closer neighbors to this 
conflict, much

[[Page S587]]

closer to what is happening there, much more likely to be affected by 
the conflict in a direct way, are countries that belong to NATO. 
Remember, through NATO, for decades, the United States has been 
providing a significant portion of the European security umbrella, an 
umbrella that has benefited not only NATO allies but also their 
neighbors for many years.
  Now, an understanding has evolved over time. There should be a 
certain percentage of GDP that NATO allies should be contributing to 
NATO. A certain percentage of their GDP should be devoted to security, 
to defense. A lot of those nations have not kept up with this and have 
missed it chronically and by a pretty significant margin. We have 
continued to provide our portion of the security umbrella to NATO, 
which is huge. It is enormous. It allows it to operate. It allows these 
nations to rely, to a significant degree, on our security umbrella.
  Year after year, when many of those nations failed to fulfill their 
duties, their part of the expectation of what it means to be a NATO 
member, in time they get trained. They get acclimated to the fact that, 
hey, this is OK. This is a pretty good deal. As a result, they can 
spend money on whatever else they want. They can spend more money on 
their social welfare programs or whatever it is that they spend money 
on in Europe--maybe it is more wine, cheese, I don't know--whatever 
their governments are spending money on that is not defense when they 
fail to meet their NATO obligation. So as a result of that, they grow 
more and more dependent on what we spend.
  Then, when there is a bad guy--Vladimir Putin--with a country--
Russia--who goes in and without provocation attacks Ukraine, again, for 
the second time in a decade, then they look to us. It is understandable 
why they do that. They looked to us for a long time. We have shouldered 
a lot of burdens around the world. And in many respects, we have a lot 
to be proud of for that.
  But this is a conversation that needs to happen because at what point 
should they have to match--no--at what point should they have to exceed 
as a percentage of GDP, perhaps collectively, those European nations in 
real dollars, what we have spent before we consider putting more on the 
line? That is a significant concern.
  Some have also expressed the concern that we are devoting all this 
time, attention, and an enormous sum of money to securing Ukraine's 
borders when our own borders are insecure. We have been flooded with 
what some estimate to be about 10 million people who have come into 
this country without documentation since January 2021 when Joe Biden 
took office. They wonder why we are doing so much to secure the borders 
of another country half a world away while doing little or nothing to 
secure our own.
  Some have also noted, whenever we get involved in a proxy war--
spending a lot of money through another country to fight yet another 
country--that is very often how we get involved in a much larger 
conflict. This wouldn't be the first time that has happened or the 
second time. It has happened a number of times. The most familiar one 
people think of is Vietnam. We start out with proxies. We build, we get 
drawn in, and we are eventually direct combatants.
  It is worth considering, worth taking into account, not necessarily 
dispositive of whether we get involved in any war, but this is a war we 
have been fighting through a proxy--Ukraine--against an adversary--
Russia--with a very large nuclear arsenal, one that is large enough to 
destroy the United States many, many times over. That has to be taken 
into account. That question becomes more meaningful every time we 
invest more money, every time we increase the lethality, the type of 
weapons assistance that we are providing to them. Those all need to be 
taken into account.
  Sometimes we don't have those conversations. For those and other 
reasons, a number of people, mostly Republicans--Republicans in the 
House and Republicans in the Senate--have expressed some concern about 
providing additional Ukraine funding.
  Last fall, when this push started in earnest, Republican leadership 
in the Senate suggested: Look, maybe what we should do, given that most 
or all Democrats in the Senate really want this funding to Ukraine, and 
we have some Republicans who want to be supportive but not as many--
maybe we should offer up something else to achieve a compromise, to 
achieve something else that is important to most, nearly all--I would 
hope all Republicans in the Senate--and that is U.S. border security.
  So for the last few months, we have anticipated what would come of 
some negotiations, which, unfortunately, became a lot more clandestine 
than I would have preferred. I speak not critically of our negotiator, 
James Lankford, who is a dear friend and a good man. I think he was 
doing the best he knew how to do with the cards he was dealt. But those 
negotiations, to my great dismay and disappointment and that of many of 
my colleagues, occurred without our day-to-day awareness of what was 
happening. We were not kept informed of exactly what was in there. We 
were given very few details, and those details emerged mostly in the 
last few weeks before this document was made public Sunday night at 7 
p.m. Eastern Standard Time, when we finally saw that measure.
  The reason why we shouldn't have months of secret negotiations in 
which most Senate Republicans were kept out of the loop became more 
apparent. The objectives of the negotiating team had drifted pretty far 
from the original stated concerns of many, if not most, Senate 
Republicans when we embarked on this process.
  The idea was to use the fact that we have a lot of enthusiasm on our 
side of the aisle to secure America's border and to pass legislation 
that would force that, that would virtually guarantee that, that would 
make it very difficult--very difficult to the point of being 
impossible--and that we would continue to set all the wrong records, as 
we did in the month of December and as we have so many times during 
this administration, on the number of people coming across the border, 
the number of people trafficked into the United States by international 
drug cartels.
  The drug cartels, by the way, are earning many billions--probably 
tens of billions of dollars--every year smuggling human traffic into 
the United States and with that human traffic are bringing in a whole 
host of other problems carried by them and inextricably intertwined 
with the human traffic they brought into the country, including enough 
fentanyl that in the last couple of years has killed over 100,000 
people per year, enough fentanyl that if distributed widely enough, 
could kill every American living in this country, every single man, 
woman, and child.

  I was told by the Border Patrol during a recent visit I made to the 
border in the Rio Grande Valley that for the first time since the 1860, 
since the adoption, in fact, of the 13th Amendment prohibiting slavery 
and indentured servitude in America, we now have significant numbers of 
people living in indentured servitude, many of them in the form of sex 
slavery, paying off the debts that they incurred while being smuggled 
into this country by the drug cartels. There was a lot of enthusiasm, 
for that reason, to stop that, to make it more difficult for that to 
continue. And that was the whole point of merging those efforts.
  So when the legislation came out Sunday night and we saw that--you 
know, while there were some changes in law that might have been helpful 
over time--there was nothing in there requiring the border to be 
materially more secure. There were enough loopholes in there, as I read 
it, enough loopholes in there that not only did it not guarantee a 
significantly better result on border security, but in some respects it 
could actually make some problems worse. It could at least prolong the 
problem.
  Those concerns were expressed. On a dime, it seemed, Senate 
Republican leadership turned on that very legislation they had been 
touting for months: It is under development. Wait until you see it. 
Instead of trying to fix that, instead of saying: All right, let's go 
back to the drawing board and see where the problem areas are, what we 
can fix, what we can't fix, they said: Let's not do it at all. They 
started quoting Republican Senators, Senators like me who had said the 
President of the United States can use existing law. And with that 
existing law, he can make material steps toward securing the border to 
the same degree that was achieved in the last administration

[[Page S588]]

using the exact same laws; that the border security crisis, as we see 
it now, is not itself something that exists for want of adequate 
legislative authority in the hands of the President.
  No, it is a willful choice on the part of the President and the 
Secretary of Homeland Security not to enforce those laws aggressively; 
in fact, in many cases not to enforce them and in some cases to openly 
flout the law, as he has, by admitting a couple of million people into 
this country under so-called immigration parole authority, parole 
authority which is supposed to be used only on a case-by-case basis and 
never a categorical basis, as it has been recently by this 
administration, to admit millions of people into this country. The 
President still could enforce the border.
  Republican leadership then made the unfortunate choice to say: Well, 
you Republicans who care about border security have been saying it is 
not the lack of adequate legislative authority that the border is not 
being enforced. Therefore, you guys shouldn't be pushing for any border 
security language at all, so we will jettison that part.
  That was never the point. The point was we were going to achieve a 
compromise. True compromise between the party should entail getting one 
thing one party likes and another thing another party likes and enough 
steam for both of them to pass when neither of them can pass. So they 
missed the point.
  By missing that point, they also missed a real opportunity, perhaps, 
to get something done there. That is unfortunate. Now, we still had a 
chance. I made the case over the last few days that we could still 
offer up something. In order to do that, Republicans would have to come 
together, and they would have to debate both of the cloture motions we 
had over the last 48 hours. And after defeating both of those, say we 
are working on a proposal that could actually get us there--one that 
could include material reforms, like H.R. 2, which has been passed by 
the House of Representatives. I know it is something that Senate 
Democrats don't necessarily dream about passing--not necessarily wild 
about it--but it is something that would materially advance the cause 
of border security and materially change the circumstances on the 
border.
  Even though the President doesn't have to have new legislative 
authority, this would force that, and we could force that by harnessing 
the enthusiasm for Ukraine aid.
  But, alas, 17 or 18 Senate Republicans chose last night to move 
forward--or yesterday afternoon, rather--to move forward and vote for 
cloture on the motion to proceed, notwithstanding the fact by then, 
they had cut off anything having to do with border security.
  This was unfortunate. We waited for months for this language. This 
language didn't do the job. We could have come up with other language, 
but we had to stick together as a team. So much for teamwork. That 
didn't pan out. That really is tragic.
  We now find ourselves faced with a bill that focuses on this 
supplemental aid package, an aid package of $95 billion, the vast 
majority of which--close to two-thirds--goes to Ukraine. Some of it 
goes elsewhere. We will talk more about that in a moment.
  There is a lot in here, a lot to cover, but let's start with the fact 
that in addition to the aid sent to Ukraine or sent to the Pentagon to 
replenish stockpiles of weapons that have been released to Ukraine 
under Presidential drawdown authority or otherwise, in addition to all 
that, it provides some $238 million--roughly a quarter of a billion 
dollars--to cover deployments of U.S. troops to Europe.
  That is significant. It begs all kinds of questions. Why is that 
happening? Where is it going exactly? If we are doing that, does that 
mean we are getting ready to be involved directly or kinetically in 
this war? What does that mean? Why are we doing this, by the way, 
without a plan, a comprehensive strategy for Ukraine? What is it that 
we want to achieve? How far are we willing to go to get there? Are we 
going to be directly involved? At what point will we be adopting or 
must we consider an authorization for the use of military force or a 
declaration of war? All those questions are left unaddressed by this as 
we spend roughly a quarter of a billion dollars on additional troop 
deployments to Europe.
  It allows for an additional $7.8 billion worth of weapons to leave 
our stockpiles, U.S. stockpiles, immediately. This is a pretty big sum 
of money.
  Now, keep in mind that for many of these weapons, especially many of 
the weapons that seem to be the most talked about and the most useful 
here, a lot of them, including the weapons systems known as HIMARS, 
Javelins, ATACMS--those are things that are being deplenished, have 
been depleted very rapidly from our stockpiles, as we have been sending 
them to Ukraine. They also happen to be many of the same weapons that 
may become very valuable, very much in demand, and very much are now in 
short supply should additional need for them break out in, for example, 
Taiwan or Israel.
  So as the planet is becoming a more dangerous place and we are 
depleting those, yes, we are authorizing an additional $7.8 billion of 
weapons to leave our stockpiles immediately. Now, why is this 
significant? Ordinarily, there is a default rule set into law that says 
you can't have more than $100 million in weapons leave our stockpiles 
through Presidential action alone without a new law being passed by 
Congress to allow that--$100 million, one-tenth of a billion dollars. 
This is many times that. And I understand that this is a deliberate 
choice. Congress can do that. After all, it is a statute that imposes a 
cap. Congress, having adopted that cap, can increase or decrease the 
cap anytime it wants to. But let's think about why. Let's think about 
how much this makes sense. Let's think about whether and to what extent 
this is in our interest--$7.8 billion. This is almost 80 times, about 
78 times the ordinary drawdown authority that we would allow absent 
some extraordinary action.
  Now, when those weapons are released--as many of them already have 
been under previous authorities--we are still looking at years before 
many of them can be replenished. This is not stuff that we can just 
produce tomorrow. You can't just turn on a switch or place an order. 
This is not like ordering a new set of double-A batteries from Amazon. 
No, this takes a fair amount of time. In fact, for some of these weapon 
systems--many of them, in fact--I am told it may well be impossible for 
us to replenish them prior to 2030. Who knows where we will be then. 
Who knows what conflicts might require their use by then. And will we 
find ourselves unprepared? One can easily imagine scenarios in which we 
could.
  If we have to engage, for example, in the Indo-Pacific in the near 
future--let's say Beijing fulfills the fears of many for years and 
decides to make a move on Taiwan--what happens then if our shelves are 
barren, left barren because of this conflict? I think that needs to be 
discussed more than it has been.
  That is one of the most unfortunate offshoots--and there are many--of 
the way this bill has been handled over the last few months. We put it 
on the back burner while it has been negotiated and negotiated, we 
thought initially--we hoped, believed initially--under terms that would 
involve our being apprised and informed regularly about what was 
happening and allowed to see text. That didn't happen.
  When we finally saw text, that text didn't contain what most of the 
Senate Republican conference asked for at the outset. Now, because of 
concerns with that part of the bill, that part of the bill was just 
jettisoned, and we are back to just the foreign aid stuff to be spent 
mostly in the same three areas we had talked about at the very 
beginning.
  As a result of all of that, it is as though there has been a 
distraction. One could use this to distract people from conversations 
like this one. So we shouldn't be rushing this one. We should have 
conversations about that and figure out whether it makes sense and what 
we are going to do in order to protect ourselves in current and such 
future conflicts as may arise, as to which we have no ability to 
predict right now.
  The legislation also allows for the Department of Defense to enter 
into new contracts for a total of $13.7 billion in new equipment--new 
equipment specifically for Ukraine through the Ukraine Security 
Assistance Initiative--with no requirement whatsoever

[[Page S589]]

for the Biden administration to prioritize contracts for our own 
readiness, for America's defense.
  Why should we be worried about that? Well, as we are worried about 
replenishing the stockpiles of the weapons I just referred to a moment 
ago, we are placing new orders, new contracts, new money--$13.7 billion 
for additional weapons--and those are all going out without any 
obligation on the part of the Biden administration to negotiate in a 
preference for a priority basis for weapons to be used by the United 
States to be placed back in the U.S. stockpiles. Where does that leave 
us? Well, I think it leaves us back in a similar position to what I 
described a moment ago.
  Look, our military is the most feared force in the world with good 
reason. We have the best and the brightest men and women in the whole 
world ready to fight for us at a moment's notice, and we also have the 
best weapons systems in the world. But when you get to be king of the 
hill, as our military currently is and I hope will be for the entirety 
of the time I am on this planet and I hope in perpetuity, you don't get 
to that point and then consider yourself immune to the risk of being 
thrown off that hill. The minute we deplete our weapons stockpiles is a 
moment that we should be concerned.
  The legislation also funds the Ukrainian National Police. It funds 
the Ukrainian National Police and State Border Guard in Ukraine with 
$300 million. That is great. I am glad that Ukrainians are concerned 
about Ukraine's borders--enough that they have apparently asked us for 
this assistance--but this bill contains nothing to secure our border. 
Last I checked, Ukraine is not being besieged by immigrants from all 
over the world, including a lot of people on the Terrorist Watchlist, 
including people from countries as far from Ukraine as the United 
States is from Afghanistan and Syria and China and all kinds of 
countries that are not in or connected to Latin America.
  See, that is another thing I learned on my most recent trip to 
McAllen, TX, from the Border Patrol, who told me that this is not what 
we have seen in the past, not what we normally expect to see coming 
across the borders. You have people from all over the world, including 
parts of the planet where there are a lot of people who don't like us 
very much and are known to plant people, to come into our country 
without let's say gestures of good will on their minds--yet another 
reason why this bill should give the American people pause. It should 
give us pause.
  If we are willing to spend that on Ukraine's border security, why not 
ours? Yes, I know they are at war, and that is significant. That is 
tragic. Yes, Vladimir Putin is a bad guy, and we don't want him to be 
able to pursue his ambitions. Our job first and foremost is to protect 
this country. When we can protect other countries half a world away, we 
ought to have that discussion, and we ought to have that discussion in 
a way that makes very clear to the American people how that benefits 
them directly, how that makes them safer.
  I don't mean to suggest that any of these questions are easily 
answered, but I do mean to say emphatically that American border 
security, which is at risk in ways that it never has been not just in 
my lifetime but in the entire existence of this country--at least since 
the end of the War of 1812 but in other ways, since it came to be--we 
are in deep trouble with our border security.
  People are pouring across who do not mean us well, and we have to be 
concerned about this. This bill turns a blind eye to that, even while 
fetishizing border security in another nation half a world away.
  I don't think the American people will take enormous comfort when 
they hear these and other concerns, when they learn that $7.8 billion 
to be sent to Ukraine through this legislation will go to ensure that 
Ukrainian bureaucrats don't miss a paycheck. We send this thing over as 
part of the economic support fund for Ukraine, and it is there, as I 
understand it, to make sure that every government employee in Ukraine 
doesn't miss a paycheck, gets paid for an entire year. Billions of 
dollars to subsidize all kinds of things in addition to paying their 
government workforce. My understanding is that it is also going out in 
various grants to subsidize everything from clothing stores to people 
who sell concert tickets for Ukraine, all while making sure their 
budget is fully funded for an entire year.
  All this is happening while Americans are living paycheck to paycheck 
and where that paycheck doesn't last very long, like it used to, 
because they have to shell out an additional $1,000 a month every 
single month, and this trend has been ongoing ever since January 20, 
2021, when Joe Biden took office, and, not coincidentally, this 
inflationary cycle steadily became worse and worse.
  The bill also begins Ukrainian reconstruction. Now, this one is 
interesting. In most parts, it sends $25 million for the transition 
initiatives account of USAID, and it sends this out for frontline and 
newly liberated communities, communities reclaimed from previous 
Russian occupation.
  There are a couple things about this that concern me. No. 1, I am not 
aware of a lot of communities that have been reclaimed. I am sure there 
are some. I am told there are a few, but they are few and far between.
  Sending $25 million--I suppose the only reason it is that small a 
number--you know, most Americans think of $25 million, and they say 
that is an enormous sum of money, and it is. It certainly is. And that 
has been hard-earned by the people who have paid it. But compared to 
the rest of this bill, it is a tiny drop in a very large bucket.
  So why should that be concerning? Well, for setting the predicate now 
for the fact that it is going to be the United States on the line--U.S. 
taxpayers on the line most notably--in order to fund these transition 
initiatives. Does that mean we are going to be responsible for 
rebuilding Ukraine as, if, when this war is won? Is that our job? Do we 
have to rebuild these buildings? Is it a hard-working mechanic from 
Denver, a plumber from Boston, a police officer from Provo? Why exactly 
are their paychecks and their dollars and their bank accounts and their 
hard-earned money being tapped for that? And more to the point, if they 
are going to be on the hook not just for these isolated, Marshall 
communities, then does that mean if--when--this war is finally won, we 
will be doing all of that? They will be concerned about that, and they 
have every reason to be.

  (Mr. OSSOFF assumed the Chair.)
  Now, the legislation does ask for a multiyear strategy for Ukraine, 
and it is a good thing to have a strategy. I wish we had a strategy for 
how this war is going to be won and how our role in it helps bring an 
end to that and how to prioritize different actions that we might 
undertake and what they might cost, what they might entail. But this 
strategy of which I speak places the United States at its helm, and as 
I understand it, it doesn't do the things that I just described that 
need to happen, but it does put the United States at the helm, sort of 
in a pole position, as the people in charge of this outside of Ukraine.
  I am not sure that is a great idea. It seems like yet another gift to 
woke and complacent European allies already not meeting their NATO 
obligations that refuse to own up to the responsibility of protecting 
and securing their own continent in their own backyard.
  Now, that takes us to another area of concern, to a different part of 
the world. The nearly $10 billion for humanitarian aid in this bill--
somewhere between $9 and $10 billion when you add up a couple of 
accounts--that by the terms of the legislation may be used in and 
around Ukraine and in and around Israel, some of that money, one has to 
assume--in theory, all of that money--could end up going to Gaza, 
humanitarian relief in Gaza. Of course, there are dire humanitarian 
conditions in Gaza, and that is heartbreaking. But there is nothing in 
this bill that, as I view it, prevents that money or such money as goes 
to Gaza from ending up in the hands of Hamas and benefiting Hamas. And 
as I look at--I am not sure there is a way to do it. And that is one of 
the reasons why I am concerned that there isn't a restriction on aid to 
Gaza here because Gaza itself is under the thumb, not of a state, not 
of a government as we would conceive of it--it is unlike anything we 
have ever known here and hopefully anything we ever will know on this 
continent, certainly in this country. But to say we are

[[Page S590]]

going to give aid to Gaza, but without it benefiting Hamas, it is 
almost impossible to conceive of.
  Let's remember what has happened in the past with other conflicts 
where we have sent humanitarian aid to other entities, places like, I 
don't know, Afghanistan, for example. Don't worry. This is humanitarian 
aid, and it is not going to get into the hands of al-Qaida and its 
affiliates--the bad people in Afghanistan who rule over Afghanistan 
with an iron fist--and it did. It empowered them. It emboldened them. 
It ultimately helped arm them.
  We are fooling ourselves if we think this is going to be any 
different. So it troubles me that we didn't draw a hard line there, 
acknowledging that almost any aid that we make available for Gaza is 
going to end up helping Hamas. And when you help Hamas, you are helping 
Iran and its proxies wage a war of terror, not only against Israel but 
against the United States, against Western civilization.
  This should concern all of us: Democrat, Republican, Independent. I 
don't care. It should be worrisome. We saw the devastation that rained 
down on Israelis who had, themselves, done nothing--nothing--to deserve 
this on October 7. We saw the inhumanity unfolding there.
  It is the tip of the iceberg compared to what they want to do, what 
they have promised to do, what we may well unwittingly equip them to do 
if we are not careful, and we have not been careful here. Shame on us.
  It also perpetuates the cycle of endless, unconditional wars in the 
Middle East, wars bought and paid for by the United States. It 
encourages escalating conflicts in the region to the tune of $2.4 
billion going to Central Command, risking direct engagement with Iran. 
Whenever we do this, we risk that. There is so much in this bill that 
risks imminent conflict with Iran, and you don't think we are talking 
about that?
  We have been so caught up talking about the palace intrigue 
associated with these phantom border security provisions that we didn't 
get to see for months. And when we saw them, we had concerns about 
them. And when we voiced those concerns to Republican leadership, we 
were told too bad, too late. We are going to characterize you as the 
reason this failed, and we are not going to consider anything else. We 
are going to join up with the Democrats to support cloture on the 
motion to proceed to legislation that unites the Democrats--all but one 
in yesterday's vote--and sharply divides Republicans. What were there? 
Seventeen Republicans who voted to support them. Uniting Democrats, 
sharply dividing Republicans, while advancing Democratic policy 
interest. This is deeply concerning.
  I want to get back to Gaza for a moment. I think a lot of Americans 
would be absolutely shocked and horrified to learn that Congress has 
almost no visibility into how our funds are used within the United 
Nations and other multilateral globalist organizations.
  With Ukraine alone, our own government admits that ``routing U.S. 
assistance funds to Ukraine through multilateral institutions . . . 
where U.S. donations will merge with funding streams from other 
international donors [and that that] has the potential to reduce 
transparency and oversight.''
  So I use this here in the context of Gaza by comparison. We know what 
we are doing. This is not a surprise. When we put money out there into 
the stream of international commerce, into the stream of international 
government-to-government business dealings, we know full well that that 
is going to end up in the hands of others, will be placed, in turn, in 
the hands of others. And before we know it, we have lost any 
opportunity to have transparency or to achieve any degree of oversight.

  So why would we expect that routing our assistance for Gaza through 
the United Nations will be any different, that it will be 1 degree 
different. We shouldn't. We are foolish to think that. In fact, think 
about it: decades of the United States bankrolling the entire United 
Nations' system. We are, by far, the United Nations' largest 
benefactor, much to my dismay. We have been for some time. But decades 
of the United States bankrolling that whole system in the United 
Nations has made taxpayers complicit in all sorts of things that 
Americans don't like, don't want, and have every reason to oppose. But 
somehow we, and the United Nations, end up being shielded from this 
because of how many times those dollars change hands.
  Well, it is not on us anymore. It is on this person. It is on the 
United Nations. The United Nations says: Well, we give it to this 
entity. We give it to that entity. Before you know it, nobody is in 
charge. Nobody is accountable for where the money went, how it was 
spent, and whether it harmed those who worked many hard hours to pay 
their taxes in the United States to fund those things.
  And in doing that, we made taxpayers complicit in all kinds of 
things: in terrorism; in blatant, virulent forms of anti-Semitism; and 
in the indoctrination of generations of children living in Gaza.
  That is one of the reasons why, once we are past this phase, once we 
are past the motion-to-proceed phase--assuming we pass it, which 
appears far too likely for my comfort--I will be introducing an 
amendment, an amendment to clarify that not only will our dollars stop 
funding UNRWA--which, mercifully, this legislation does. Mercifully, 
this legislation says none of it can go to UNRWA, a U.N. entity that 
has been particularly problematic in promoting anti-Semitism, violent 
rhetoric, advocating for acts of violence against Jewish people, and 
other hateful rhetoric. Not only will our dollars stop funding UNRWA, 
but they will no longer fund any U.N. organization operating in Gaza.
  Look, we have been down this road before, funneling our aid dollars 
through multilateral institutions, and we know exactly how this ends. 
Without my amendment--I have got others, lots of others, in fact--but 
without this particular amendment of which I now speak, there is 
nothing in this bill to prevent the administration from taking funds 
that would otherwise have gone to UNRWA and redirecting them to any of 
the or any combination of the nearly 2 dozen other U.N. entities that 
happen to operate in Gaza, where we lose all visibility into where our 
dollars end up and how they are used.
  Look, enough is enough. Like most multilateral institutions supported 
by the United States as the principal benefactor or not, the U.N. is a 
bloated, corrupt system far past its prime, and it has proven 
adversarial to U.S. interests, interests of the United States as a 
whole and of its people.
  A truly just outcome would be for us to stop funding the United 
Nations overall, and I have been advocating for that. But that is a 
discussion point for a different day.
  But the point here that I have to make is that we can't trust this 
administration not to fund U.N. programs in Gaza, and we can't trust 
the U.N. not to fund terrorists, which is exactly why my amendment is 
urgently needed.
  Before I close, I also want to talk about another amendment that I 
will be introducing--again, this is a nonexhaustive list--but another 
one that needs to be mentioned here is one that imposes restrictions on 
the economic support fund in the legislation, the economic support fund 
relative to Ukraine.
  Every dollar in economic aid in this bill for Ukraine really is, as 
written, it is a slap in the face to every hard-working American 
battling the cost-of-living crisis created by Bidenomics here at home.
  Now, economic aid isn't going to win the war for Ukraine. On the 
contrary, economic aid may, at best, prove to be a waste of money, may, 
at worst, end up prolonging the conflict, prolonging the problems and 
the agony from it by masking the true cost to Ukrainians and to 
Europeans, more broadly, of this conflict. Americans would be furious 
to learn that billions of dollars out of their paychecks are 
subsidizing clothing stores and concert tickets for Ukrainians, while 
families here live paycheck to paycheck.
  Now, some of my colleagues called the billions of dollars in economic 
assistance provided to Ukraine a small amount. Really? Economic 
assistance makes up 34 percent of the $113 billion in assistance the 
United States has already provided to Ukraine. Calling that a small 
portion is an insult to every struggling American, every American 
family struggling to put food on the table and a roof over their heads.
  But leaders of both parties will tell you that this bill will cut 
economic aid

[[Page S591]]

to Ukraine. Well, that is a lie. One doesn't cut aid by adding to it. 
And let's be clear: Providing $7.8 billion instead of Biden's initial 
boondoggle request of roughly $11 billion is not a cut. It is simply 
starting with a larger number only to reduce it. It is not a cut.

  The bill, as written, mercifully prohibits pension pays out of that 
economic assistance fund, but it allows American tax dollars to keep 
paying the salaries of Zelenskyy and his bureaucrats.
  Now, my colleagues have also said that cutting economic aid to 
Ukraine in this bill sends a message to our European NATO allies to 
step up and do more. But make no mistake, this is a laughable attempt 
at burden sharing.
  Look, my time is expiring. I will be back. I will be back to speak 
more of concerns that I have with the legislation and ways that I have 
come up with that, if passed by this body prior to passage of this 
bill, could make some things better, could make some things less bad. I 
think, at this point, that may be the best thing we can do. We will do 
everything we can do it.
  Make no mistake, this bill is a mistake. It has been written in the 
wrong way, and it serves the wrong people. Our job, first and foremost, 
is to do no harm to the American people, and, on that front, this bill 
fails miserably.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.
  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be 
permitted to speak for up to 15 minutes, Senator Murray be permitted to 
speak for up to 5 minutes, and Leader Schumer for up to 5 minutes prior 
to the rollcall vote.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  Without objection, it is so ordered.


                          Supplemental Funding

  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to urge strong support for the 
national security supplemental appropriations bill before us.
  Earlier this week, General Kurilla, the Commander of U.S. Central 
Command, told me that this is the most dangerous time in 50 years. The 
threats the United States faces from an aggressive Iran and its 
proxies, an imperialist Russia, and a hegemonic China are 
interconnected, and they require our immediate attention. That is why 
this bill focuses not only on strengthening our allies but also on 
fortifying our military and rebuilding our own defense industrial base.
  Since October, there have been more than 170 attacks on U.S. 
servicemembers throughout the Middle East. We have seen unprovoked 
attacks on our naval ships and the loss of two Navy SEALs at sea and 
three brave servicemembers in Jordan.
  Merchant ships have been attacked in the Red Sea. They have been 
protected by our Navy ships, including, I am proud to say, the USS 
Carney, a destroyer built at Bath Iron Works in Maine, which has shot 
down numerous Houthi UAVs.
  Despite the perilous times we live in, I heard a colleague suggest on 
the Senate floor that we are not ready to consider this bill. I would 
contend that we cannot wait any longer.
  He also implied that it had been shrouded in secrecy. That is simply 
inconsistent with the facts.
  The package before us is the result of months of deliberations, 
starting on October 20, when the President submitted his national 
security supplemental request to Congress, available for all to read 
and review.
  On October 31, the Senate Appropriations Committee held a 3\1/2\-hour 
hearing on the request. Virtually every Member of the Committee 
attended. Secretary of State Blinken and Secretary of Defense Austin 
testified. Prior to this hearing--this public hearing--the last time 
the Committee held a hearing on a supplemental budget request was March 
25, 2010--more than 13\1/2\ years earlier.
  So, under the leadership of Chairman Murray and myself, we have been 
transparent. We have held countless public hearings, including on the 
supplemental before us.
  The following week, our committee held a second hearing. At this 
hearing, the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Health and Human 
Services testified on the supplemental request. In the time that 
followed, there were numerous discussions on the content of the 
supplemental funding bill. Information was gathered on emerging needs, 
particularly with regard to U.S. military operations in the Middle 
East, and the bill's language was refined and improved.

  On February 4, the text of the national security and border 
supplemental was released along with a section-by-section analysis to 
make it easier for Members.
  After it was clear that there was not sufficient support to advance 
the border security provisions, revised text and a summary were 
circulated that excluded the border security sections, and that is the 
package before us today--a package that has taken us months to get to 
this point and that began in October with the submission of the budget 
request and was subjected to extensive public hearings.
  Further delay--or worse, an outright refusal to address these 
challenges--cannot be the answer. There is simply too much at risk.
  The package before us would bolster U.S. military readiness, help 
Ukraine counter Russian aggression, assist Israel in its fight against 
terrorists, and deter a rising China.
  Now let me briefly describe the major components of this legislation.
  First, $35 billion would go to restoring U.S. military readiness. 
This includes $26 billion to replenish Defense Department stockpiles 
with new and, in many cases, upgraded weapons and equipment; $5.4 
billion to increase production capacity for artillery, air defense, and 
long-range precision missiles; $3.3 billion to enhance the U.S. 
submarine industrial base in support of our trilateral security 
partnership with the United Kingdom and Australia, known as AUKUS.
  This funding directly supports our military defense and defense 
industrial base. One of the ways that we support Ukraine, Israel, and 
Taiwan is through the transfer of weapons and equipment from our 
stockpiles. The replenishment funding that I just mentioned allows us 
to replace those articles with new and often more modern, more 
effective munitions and equipment, benefitting both our military and 
theirs. By modernizing our arsenal of democracy and improving the 
readiness of the U.S. military to deter any adversary, this funding 
makes America stronger.
  Second, the bill provides resources to assist Ukraine as it defends 
its territory following the second Russian invasion. And let us keep in 
mind, Putin has made no secret of his plan. His plan is to re-create 
the former Soviet Union. If he is allowed to be successful in Ukraine, 
I believe he will then seize Moldova, invade Georgia, menace the Baltic 
States, and threaten Poland. And then our troops will be involved in a 
European war.
  Today, we are not the one. Our troops are not dying on the Ukrainian 
battlefield.
  We include $15.4 billion to help Ukraine purchase weapons from the 
U.S. industry so that it can defend itself. It includes $11.3 billion 
to support our servicemembers in Europe, principally in Poland and 
Germany, who are helping our allies equip and train Ukrainian forces. 
It also provides $9.4 billion for economic assistance to help Ukraine 
rebuild its economy.
  Now, let me spend a moment on this point. The President's request for 
direct budget support was $11.8 billion. We rejected that amount as too 
much. We reduced it to $7.8 billion, and we further stipulated that no 
funds could be used to reimburse pensions.
  Tonight, I heard on the floor that the Europeans were not doing their 
part. That is simply not true. Many of our European partners--I think 
of the Baltic States, for example, with whom Chair Murray and I met 
with representatives of recently--are contributing a greater percentage 
of their GDP, by far, than we are.
  Why are we joining our European allies in providing economic 
assistance to Ukraine? As part of his plan to try to force Ukraine to 
surrender, Putin has sought to destroy Ukraine's economy, tax base, and 
exports, including grain exports. This funding seeks to help Ukraine 
rebuild so that ultimately it will be able to provide for itself 
economically once again.
  But we are not just giving blank checks. We have included $23 million 
for inspectors general for continued oversight of Ukraine assistance, 
including funding for the special IG that was established in this 
year's National Defense Authorization Act.

[[Page S592]]

  Earlier in this debate, one of our colleagues suggested that our 
country had no strategy for Ukraine. But, once again, the language of 
this bill has been ignored. It requires a strategy with achievable 
objectives with respect to U.S. assistance to Ukraine. And the 
Appropriations Committee did not draft this language alone. We did so 
in consultation with the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services 
Committees.
  Third, this bill fully funds the budget request to support Israel in 
the war against Hamas. It includes $5.2 billion for Israel's missile 
defense programs, including Iron Dome, David's Sling, and Iron Beam. 
The first two of those are coproduced with the United States. It also 
includes funding from--foreign military financing for Israel and 
funding for U.S. Embassy support, oversight, and other assistance.

  This next part is really important. The bill includes--it adds to the 
supplemental $2.4 billion to support our U.S. forces as they face 
ongoing attacks in the region and to sustain U.S. military operations 
in Central Command against the Houthis and other Iranian-backed 
proxies. General Kurilla stressed to me how critical this funding is.
  Fourth, this bill includes resources aimed at deterring a rising 
China.
  It includes $2 billion in foreign military financing for the Indo-
Pacific region, which includes, obviously, Taiwan but also the 
Philippines and Vietnam.
  It provides funding for missile defense for Guam, for new 
technologies to detect undersea threats, and for training and 
exercises.
  Funding is also included to address a chokepoint in the supply chain 
for motors that affects multiple long-range cruise missiles, including 
Harpoons and the Tomahawk.
  The submarine industrial base investments that I previously mentioned 
will also benefit our regional partners as they help the United States 
meet its commitment under AUKUS while protecting the size of our own 
submarine fleet.
  Finally, I want to note that this bill includes $9 billion for global 
humanitarian assistance. This funding would help the State Department 
and USAID respond to critical humanitarian needs around the world, from 
Ukraine and Eastern Europe to the Middle East and Africa. More than 108 
million people worldwide are forcibly displaced today.
  I want to emphasize that only 15 percent of that assistance--$1.4 
billion--is for Gaza, and of that amount, the $400 million that had 
been targeted by the administration to flow through the United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency will not go through UNRWA.
  Despite allegations highlighted in the Wall Street Journal last month 
and numerous other publications that at least 12 UNRWA employees had 
been directly involved in Hamas's October 7 terrorist attack on Israel 
and in taking hostages and that around 10 percent of all of its Gaza 
staff have ties to Islamic militant groups, incredibly, the Biden 
administration continued to push for UNRWA funding.
  I want my colleagues to know that this bill includes an outright 
prohibition on funding in this supplemental and prior appropriations 
from being used for any grants, contributions, or other U.S. payments 
to UNRWA. We can distribute that humanitarian assistance through other 
organizations.
  The bill also includes stringent guardrails on humanitarian 
assistance to Gaza. By March 1, the Secretary of State must certify 
that policies, processes, and guidelines have been established and are 
in use to prevent the diversion of aid by Hamas or other terrorist 
groups. This includes consultations with the Government of Israel, 
which has made clear the importance of humanitarian assistance to its 
objectives in Gaza. Third-party monitoring and intelligence assessments 
provide additional layers of oversight. Finally, we include a total of 
$10 million to the State Department and USAID inspectors general--
funding that the administration did not request but that should 
accompany any assistance for Gaza.
  I encourage my colleagues at this time, this perilous time, to 
support this bill that includes the funding desperately needed to 
strengthen America's military readiness, to help Ukraine counter brutal 
Russian aggression, to assist our closest ally in the Middle East, 
Israel, in its fight against terrorism, and to deter a rising China. 
The stakes are high, and we must meet the moment.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Butler). The Senator from Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, let's be clear. The stakes of this 
moment could not be higher. The question before us is nothing short of 
what kind of future do we want for our kids.
  Our role as the leader of the free world is on the line. If we tell 
dictators like Putin they can trample sovereign democracies with 
impunity; if we tell our allies that they are on their own; if we tell 
suffering civilians help is not on the way; if we tell the world the 
era of American leadership and resolve is over, we will be inviting 
chaos, emboldening dictators, and leaving the world a much more 
dangerous place for our kids. That is exactly why this package is so 
important. That is why we have insisted for months on a serious, 
comprehensive national security supplemental that actually meets this 
moment and doesn't leave any of our allies behind.
  It has been a long, frustrating road, but Democrats have been glued 
to the negotiating table because failure is not an option here.
  Listen, I hope we move forward quickly on this package now. I, like 
many others, want a fair and reasonable, bipartisan amendment process, 
but recognize that those of us who understand the stakes of this moment 
are ready to stay here as long as it takes to get this done.
  I hope all of our colleagues will continue to work with me and the 
Senator from Maine to get this over the finish line because right now 
soldiers in Ukraine are counting their bullets, wondering how long they 
can hold out. Dictators are watching closely to see if this is their 
time to make a move. Civilians, including kids, are caught in the 
crossfire and are in desperate need of food and water and medical care.
  We do not have a second to lose, so let's get this done and show the 
world American leadership is still strong.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in a few moments, the Senate is going 
to take the next step toward passing the supplemental. Tonight's vote 
keeps the process of passing this emergency national security package 
moving forward on the Senate floor.
  As I said, I hope our Republican colleagues can work with us to reach 
an agreement on amendments so we can move this bill more quickly. 
Democrats are willing to consider reasonable and fair amendments here 
on the floor as we have shown on many occasions in the past 3 years. 
Nevertheless, the Senate will keep working on this bill until the job 
is done.
  I yield the floor.


                             Vote on Motion

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All postcloture time has expired.
  The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?
  There is a sufficient second.
  The clerk will call the roll.

       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the 
     ``Preventing Terrorism at the U.N. Act of 2024''.
       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for 
     Palestine Refugees in the Near East (referred to in this 
     section as ``UNRWA'') was established through passage of 
     United Nations Resolution 302 (1949) to assist Arab refugees 
     who had been displaced by the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict.
       (2) The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
     (referred to in this section as ``UNHCR'') was established by 
     the United Nations General Assembly in 1950 to assist 
     refugees and other displaced persons, including internally 
     displaced persons, in all regions around the world.
       (3) UNRWA is the only specialized agency or entity of the 
     United Nations with a sole conflict or regional mandate.
       (4) For years, UNRWA has faced credible and corroborated 
     accusations of corruption, antisemitism, and support for 
     terrorism.
       (5) Such accusations include the use of antisemitic 
     material in UNRWA classrooms and the use of UNWRA facilities 
     for the storage of munitions by Hamas, an Iranian-backed, 
     United States-designated foreign terrorist organization.
       (6) On January 26, 2024, UNRWA terminated the contracts of 
     12 staff members who were accused of participating in Hamas' 
     brutal terrorist attacks against Israel on October 7, 2023.
       (7) The attacks of October 7, 2023, claimed the lives of 
     1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 35 citizens 
     of the United States, and resulted in the hostage taking of 
     240 Israelis and foreign nationals.
       (8) The United States has contributed more than 
     $7,000,000,000 to UNRWA since 1949, making it the largest 
     individual donor to the agency.
       (9) United States contributions to UNRWA were suspended 
     from 2018 through 2020, due to allegations of corruption, 
     antisemitism, and support for terrorism.
       (10) The United States has provided more than $730,000,000 
     to UNRWA since United States contributions to the agency 
     resumed in 2021.
       (11) Following the accusations of the involvement of UNRWA 
     staff in the terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, the 
     Department of State announced the temporary suspension of 
     United States funding to UNRWA.
       (12) Since January 26, 2024, more than sixteen additional 
     countries and the European Union have suspended their 
     contributions to UNRWA.
       (13) While the majority of funding for UNRWA comes from 
     voluntary contributions, the agency receives a portion of its 
     funding from the regular budget of the United Nations.
       (14) The estimated budget for the UNRWA for United Nations 
     fiscal year 2024 includes $55,176,800 from the regular budget 
     of the United Nations.
       (15) The United States provides 22 percent of the regular 
     budget of the United Nations.
       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     the UNHCR should serve all global refugee and displaced 
     person populations, including those within the original 
     jurisdiction of the UNRWA.

     United Nations.--No funds may be provided as a voluntary or 
     assessed contribution of the United States to the United 
     Nations, including any organ, agency, or entity of the United 
     Nations until--

       (2) the Secretary of State certifies to the appropriate 
     congressional committees that the that the United Nations has 
     completed appropriate counterterrorism vetting for all United 
     Nations employees and contractors operating in the original 
     jurisdiction of the UNRWA; and
       (3) the Secretary of State certifies to the appropriate 
     congressional committees that the United Nations, including 
     staff and facilities receiving United Nations funding, do not 
     teach, promote, or include in materials, such as textbooks 
     and other instructional materials, any content that promotes 
     antisemitism or encourages violence or intolerance toward 
     other countries or ethnic groups.
       (e) Transition Report.--Not later than 180 days after the 
     date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit 
     to the appropriate congressional committees a report that--
       (1) identifies the totality of services provided by UNRWA;
       (2) details how such services will be absorbed by existing 
     United Nations funds, programs, specialized agencies, and 
     organizations;
       (3) details how such services may be absorbed through 
     bilateral assistance;
       (4) includes a plan to ensure all United Nations funds, 
     programs, specialized agencies, and organizations implement 
     and maintain stringent counterterrorism vetting standards; 
     and
       (5) includes a plan to ensure all United Nations funds, 
     programs, specialized agencies, and organizations implement 
     and maintain stringent oversight of educational material and 
     curriculum that prohibits all content that promotes 
     antisemitism or encourages violence or intolerance toward 
     other countries or ethnic groups.
       (f) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this 
     section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''

Mr. President, from the earliest days of Vladimir 
Putin's escalation in Ukraine, America's closest allies and partners 
have been paying close attention.
  From halfway around the world in the Indo-Pacific, our friends have 
made it clear that in the Ukrainian people's fight, they see their own 
future.
  From Taiwan:

       Ukraine's survival is Taiwan's survival.

  From Japan:

       Security in Europe and security in the Indo-Pacific are 
     inseparable.

  From Australia:

       It is absolutely in the interest of every free country that 
     Putin's aggression fails.

  But why? Why would peaceful people dare to get involved in others' 
fights? Why would leaders in Asia contribute billions of dollars in 
weapons to help Ukraine defeat Russian aggression? Why would the Prime 
Minister of Japan and the President of South Korea bother with long 
journeys to wartime Kyiv to express solidarity with Ukraine? Why not 
just pull up the drawbridge and keep quiet? Because our allies and 
partners are not naive. Because they know that unchecked aggression 
begets more. Because they know that victory for Russia means a green 
light for China. Because they know that neglecting Ukraine's fight to 
restore its sovereignty raises the costs of defending their own.
  Our partners don't have the luxury of pretending that the world's 
most dangerous aggressors are someone else's problem, and neither do 
we.
  So, today, it is no exaggeration to say that the eyes of the world 
are on the U.S. Senate. Our allies and partners are hoping that the 
indispensable nation--the leader of the free world--has the resolve to 
continue, and our adversaries are hoping for something quite different. 
Friends and foes alike pay close attention to what we say here and to 
how we vote because American leadership matters, and it is in question.
  But let's be absolutely clear. The United States didn't give our 
``greatest generation'' to the fight against Nazi Germany or commit 
half a century of focus and resources to defeating Soviet communism 
just out of a sense of altruism, and we aren't helping partners resist 
authoritarian aggression today out of some warm and fuzzy sense of 
charity. We haven't equipped the brave people of Ukraine, Israel, or 
Taiwan with lethal capabilities in order to win philanthropic 
accolades. We are not urgently strengthening defenses in the Indo-
Pacific because it feels good. We don't wield American strength 
frivolously. We do it because it is in our own interest. We equip our 
friends to face our shared adversaries so we are less likely to have to 
spend American lives to defeat them.
  For years, I have warned about the growing threats to America's 
national security and the growing coordination among our adversaries.
  And, for years, I have worked to steer greater investments toward the 
hard power needed to deter them.
  The Russian despot trying to conquer Ukraine also wants to see 
America weakened.
  The Chinese autocrat hoping to subjugate Taiwan also wants to consign 
American leadership to history.
  The Iranian regime that equips the slaughter of Israel's Jews and a 
terrorist war on international commerce also wants to shatter our 
influence in the region and spill American blood in the process.
  They tell us by their actions. Pretending not to hear them is not an 
option. Delaying until the costs in American lives and treasure rise 
immeasurably is not an option. The time to stand up to these gathering 
threats is right now.
  Every night, millions of Americans sleep in peace because brave men 
and women continue to answer the call to serve in our Nation's Armed 
Forces. Every day, millions of Americans turn for their livelihood to 
an economic order built and underwritten by American leadership. And 
every time that peace and prosperity are threatened, we stand with 
allies and partners who trust in the righteousness of that leadership 
and the credibility of our commitments.
  Today, the future of the world I have just described is in question. 
The endurance of an order in which American support is craved and 
American strength is feared is in doubt. And we, the United States of 
America, have the most to lose.
  Ever since we came to the aid of our allies 80 years ago, America has 
been an inseparable partner in the security of Europe, not out of 
charity but because our own security and prosperity is tied to it.
  Ever since we were attacked in 1941, America has helped guarantee 
stability and free commerce in the Indo-Pacific, not as a moral gesture 
but because we have core interests of our own in this critical part of 
the world.
  Ever since the establishment of the modern Jewish State of Israel in 
1948, America has stood by her, not out of generosity but because of 
the enduring values and interests we share: in security, in democracy, 
and in peace.
  I know it has become quite fashionable in some circles to disregard 
the global interests we have as a global power, to bemoan the 
responsibilities of global leadership, to lament the commitment that 
has underpinned the longest drought of great power conflict in human 
history. This is idle work for idle minds, and it has no place in the 
U.S. Senate.
  In this Chamber, we must face the world as it is. We must reject the 
dimmest and most shortsighted views of our obligations and grapple 
instead with actual problems, as they come, in the harsh light of day.
  And, today, the questions facing this body are quite simple. Will we 
give those who wish us harm more reason to question our resolve? Or 
will we recommit to exercising American strength?
  Will we give those who crave our leadership more reason to wonder if 
it is in decline? Or will we invest in the credibility that underpins 
our entire way of life?
  I cannot answer these questions for any one of my colleagues, but 
none of us can afford to get them wrong.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Maine.
  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the national security supplemental before 
us is of profound importance to America's security. It will provide 
updated, modern, effective munitions to our troops, rebuild our 
flagging defense industrial base, allow our Navy to continue its vital 
operations in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, and support our 
allies.

[[Page S839]]

  Now, time does not permit me to correct every misunderstanding and 
misrepresentation about this bill that we have heard on the Senate 
floor and elsewhere, but I do want to correct some of the most 
egregious misstatements because the American people should have the 
facts.
  The defense supplemental bill before us would strengthen our own 
military by providing $35 billion to restore our military readiness, 
modernize our arsenal of democracy, and rebuild our defense industrial 
base. It would send a strong message to Putin that his goal--his 
dream--of capturing free, democratic nations like Ukraine will not be 
allowed to succeed. It would reassure our closest ally in the Middle 
East, Israel, which is battling terrorists who have killed more 
Israelis--more Jews--in a single day since the Holocaust, who have 
taken as hostages babies and the elderly, and who are using innocent 
Palestinians as human shields. It would help deter a rising and 
menacing China, whose navy now exceeds the size of our own. Each of 
these investments is in our self-interest. It makes America more 
secure.

  A claim was made yesterday that this bill gives $238 million to 
increase U.S. troop deployments to Europe. The implication was that 
this bill increases funding to send U.S. troops into combat in Ukraine.
  That is simply not true. The funding in this bill supports, through 
the end of the year, U.S. servicemembers who are principally in Poland 
and Germany working with our allies to train and equip the courageous 
Ukrainians.
  The Ukrainians are the ones who are doing the fighting and taking the 
casualties. No American soldiers are dying on the Ukrainian 
battlefield. We are training and equipping the Ukrainians because it is 
the right thing to do, but, also, is in America's self-interest.
  The best way to ensure that the United States is not drawn into a 
larger regional war in Europe, in which our troops could be put at 
risk, is by helping Ukraine defend itself against this brutal, 
unprovoked invasion. If Russia prevails in Ukraine, Putin will be in a 
position to threaten our NATO allies all along Ukraine's border, 
including Poland and one of our newest members, Finland.
  What we are doing through this bill is to greatly diminish the risk 
that the United States could be drawn into these larger conflicts. 
History is filled with examples of well-intentioned leaders who sought 
to avoid war but who actually made war more likely by refusing to 
recognize the evil with which they were confronted. Neville Chamberlain 
declared ``peace in our time'' trying to appease Germany before World 
War II began. We should not make that same mistake today.
  Another charge that I heard yesterday is that Europe is not doing 
enough to support Ukraine and that the way to get them to do more is 
for us to do less. Again, this assertion is false.
  In terms of security assistance provided to Ukraine as a percentage 
of GDP--the only fair way to measure it--the United States ranks 15th 
globally--15th. Estonia ranks No. 1. Estonia has the same population as 
the State of Maine--1.3 million people. Yet it has provided 10 times as 
much, as a percentage of its GDP, as our country has to help the 
Ukrainians.
  On February 1, the European Council unanimously approved a 4-year 
``Ukrainian Facility'' economic assistance package worth $54 billion. 
That equals nearly $13.5 billion per year. And that is on top of what 
other countries have already provided, which is approximately $63 
billion in nonsecurity assistance.
  Now, I want to stress that throughout this process, which began last 
October and included extensive hearings and much consultation, we did 
not rubberstamp the Biden administration's budget request. Many changes 
were made throughout the process. But let me just touch on three.
  First, the President requested $11.8 billion for direct budget 
support for Ukraine. We reduced that amount by $4 billion--more than 30 
percent. Furthermore, that budget support will phase out over time. 
This assistance, however, is critical because it helps ensure that 
Russia cannot win this war by utterly destroying Ukraine's economy, as 
Putin is trying to do, and it allows Ukraine to focus more of its 
national resources on the war effort.
  The second important change: This bill includes a clear and strict 
prohibition on funding in this bill and in prior appropriations from 
being used for any kind of financial support to the United Nations 
Relief and Work Agency, known as UNRWA.
  Yesterday's news that the Hamas tunnel was found under UNRWA's 
headquarters in Gaza and that Hamas was using UNRWA's electricity to 
power a command and control section underneath the headquarters 
underscores the need to ensure that not a single penny of taxpayer 
funds is provided to that agency, much less the $400 million that was 
in the President's original request. And I would note that the evidence 
is overwhelming that 12 employees of UNRWA directly participated in the 
October 7 horrific attacks on Israel. And the estimates are that about 
10 percent of their employees are involved in terrorist groups. This 
organization is thoroughly infiltrated by Hamas and other groups.

  Third, we included strict guardrails for all the humanitarian 
assistance for Gaza. By March 1, USAID and the State Department have to 
have procedures, processes, and policies in place that are developed in 
consultation with Israel to ensure that money is not diverted from the 
legitimate humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians to 
terrorist groups like Hamas.
  It was suggested on the floor yesterday that we have no oversight of 
this assistance and no way of knowing where it is going. That is simply 
wrong. USAID delivers direct budget support through a World Bank 
mechanism whereby the funds that are released to the Government of 
Ukraine are done so on a reimbursement basis for verified, preagreed 
categories of expenditures only.
  In addition, USAID employs a rigorous monitoring system that involves 
two international accounting firms, Deloitte and KPMG, to audit this 
assistance. We have increased funding for the Office of Inspector 
General for both Ukraine funding and for the Gaza funding.
  Let me discuss, also, the support that we provide Ukraine, Israel, 
and Taiwan through the transfer of weapons and equipment from our 
stockpiles. A concern was raised on the floor yesterday that this would 
leave our own military vulnerable and without enough weapons. It is 
important to remember that this bill includes $35 billion to restore 
U.S. military readiness and modernize our arsenal of democracy. For 
every dollar of authority provided to transfer weapons to Ukraine in 
this bill, there is $2.50 to replenish U.S. military stockpiles. And 
most of the time, this allows us to replace those older items with more 
modern, effective, and improved weapons. In the case of Israel, many of 
the weapons systems such as Iron Dome and David's Sling are coproduced 
by both the United States and Israel. The Under Secretary for 
Acquisition and Sustainment has said ``production is deterrence.'' The 
supplemental includes $8.3 billion in historic investments to greatly 
expand our production capacity. This will result in a strong, resilient 
munitions industrial base capable of surging to meet the threats facing 
our country.
  But if we do not pass this supplemental now, none of these 
investments will occur.
  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. There are so many 
other misrepresentations that I wish I had time to counter today.
  Let me tell you that this funding is desperately needed to strengthen 
America's military readiness; to help Ukraine counter brutal Russian 
aggression; to assist our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel, in 
its fight against terrorism; and to deter a rising and menacing China.
  In American history, it was our very first President, George 
Washington, who used the term ``peace through strength'' in his fifth 
State of the Union Address. Centuries later, President Ronald Reagan 
reminded us of the vital importance of peace through strength. That is 
the goal of the legislation before us. That is what it will accomplish 
as we meet the challenge of the perilous times in which we live.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.
  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise with immense pride to be from Maine 
this afternoon.
  I want to thank my colleague for not only the hard work that she and 
the

[[Page S840]]

members of the Appropriations Committee have put in over the past 4 
months to bring this bill to the place where it is but also for her 
vocal and outstanding and moving leadership on this issue.
  I simply want to express, I am very proud to be from Maine this 
afternoon and thank you to my colleague.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.
  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to thank my distinguished 
colleague from Maine for his very kind comments.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me join the comments of the 
Independent Democratic Senator from Maine and the kind words for his 
colleague because what she said in a brief period of time is so 
important at this moment of debate.
  I note with pride that of the top nations, on a proportional basis, 
supporting the effort in Ukraine, the Baltics ranked at the top and 
that these small nations, determined to be free, know what it means to 
invest in the cause of the Ukrainians.
  I also note and I believe she made reference to the fact that a 
country like Poland, which ranks fifth on the list of proportional 
assistance to Ukraine, is giving so much that is not accounted for in 
the ledger books. The people of Ukraine, when they left in a panic over 
the invasion of the Russians, went to Poland and were accepted in that 
country as neighbors that were going to give a helping hand when the 
Polish people opened their homes. The leader in the Polish Government 
said to me: Senator, you look all over Poland. You won't find a refugee 
camp of Ukrainian refugees. They are living in our homes.
  That type of assistance is not calculated easily in the accounting 
books, but it is meaningful.
  I might add that among the top five nations I noted on the chart was 
Finland. Finland, because of its leadership, decided to join NATO. And 
their arrival, it is my understanding, and their accession into NATO 
doubled the border that Russia has to face of NATO countries in size. 
Finland is a very large country. We are glad to have them as part of 
NATO and its future. That is at stake as well.
  I don't want to get political in this issue about the future of NATO, 
but I think it is pretty clear there are those of us who believe 31 
nations in NATO are indispensable for maintaining security in Europe 
for years to come--decades to come--and we have to invest in it.
  If the United States should step away from this NATO commitment to 
Ukraine by its action on Capitol Hill, shame on us. There is so much at 
stake here in terms of the future of democracy.
  Last night--I will close with this--as I was leaving Capitol Hill in 
the darkness, I passed by four or five people standing on the sidewalk 
outside. They were Ukrainians and Ukrainian Americans who were there to 
beg us to stand by their country in this hour of need. They have been 
keeping a watch for weeks and months at a time so that the U.S. 
commitment to Ukraine is appreciated by them, and they express it to us 
as Members of Congress.
  I saw them standing in the dark and realized there may be many 
Americans going about their business, but these Ukrainian Americans 
know that this decision by the U.S. Congress and the Senate and the 
House could literally decide the future and fate of their homeland in 
Ukraine.
  I think it is an essential responsibility on a bipartisan basis. And 
I thank Senator McConnell for his inspiring words this morning. On a 
bipartisan basis, we need to stand with Ukraine in their hour of need.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, in this Chamber over the last couple of 
months, we have heard haunting echoes of the past, haunting echoes of 
Chamberlain going to Munich in 1938 to say to Hitler: Go ahead. Take 
that slice of Czechoslovakia. We will simply look the other way and 
declare peace in our time.
  The parallel is not just haunting, it is scary. Folks advocating for 
saying to Putin: Just go ahead, take Ukraine. We will look the other 
way and tackle other challenges.
  In both cases, you had an authoritarian in Hitler, in Putin, 
determined to take adjacent land and certainly in Putin's case, 
determined to crush the democracy of the Republic to the south. 
Ukrainians speak a language that is a close cousin to Russia. Putin 
particularly resents the loss of so much territory, so many states that 
he controlled--or the Soviet Union controlled--not so long ago, and his 
mission is to reclaim as much as he can.
  It should be our mission--it is our mission; it is the American 
mission--to defend democracy in the world, to stand with people who are 
all about freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and freedom of 
religion and the freedom to cast a fair ballot to determine their own 
future. Those are all the values that Putin opposes.
  So much is at stake here for the future freedom of the people of 
Ukraine but also for American leadership in the world. If we follow in 
Chamberlain's footsteps from 1938 and look the other way, where else--
where else--will Putin decide to tackle? And how much partnership will 
we lose in the cause of democracy and freedom by breaking the pact we 
have forged so carefully with Europe to support Ukraine? And how much 
future blood will flow from our sons and daughters as we stand in other 
battles because of our failure in this case to stand with the people of 
Ukraine?
  Xi of China is watching carefully. Can the autocrat simply endure 
until the American people are tired, endure until the partnership 
between Europe and the United States breaks down? Can he simply 
maintain an assault on Taiwan until we fade away with other priorities?
  It is a vision in the world that we have been proud to fight for, the 
vision of democracy and the vision of freedom. This is the moment when 
we have the opportunity to actually secure a bill here in the Senate to 
fund the people of Ukraine. We are not being asked to shed our blood. 
We are not being asked to put our soldiers, our men and women, on the 
battlefield. We are not even being asked to put a huge share of our 
budget into this battle. It is 1.5 percent of our national budget--one 
and a half pennies on the dollar of our budget.
  If we cannot sustain even that modest commitment to stand for 
freedom, to stand for voting integrity in a Republic, in a democracy, 
then on what course has the United States gone?
  Let us stay the course as champions of freedom and champions of 
democracy and take a strong step forward today to completing the work 
of making sure we stand with the people of Ukraine, we maintain our 
partnership with Europe, and we continue to lead for freedom and 
democracy.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.
  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I am asking my colleagues to support my 
motion to table the motion to recommit.
  Now, even for seasoned Senators, this sounds like a lot of technical 
language, and it kind of is; so let's put it in perspective and explain 
what it actually means.
  What is really going on here is that we have got the majority leader 
who has decided to obstruct an open and fair amendment process.
  The motion to commit, which my motion aims to dispense with, is what 
Senator Schumer is using to block every Member of this body from 
accessing the amendment tree and offering up amendments as they please, 
making them pending, then having them dispensed with.
  Instead, Leader Schumer is dictating which amendments are allowed to 
be voted on and which are not. To cut to the chase, essentially, all of 
them are not. And then he turns around and accuses Republicans of being 
obstructionists for not wanting to play by his arbitrary rules.
  Now, some have suggested that too many amendments have been filed, 
pointing out that among a handful of Republicans, over 80 amendments 
were filed. This is not a reason to not allow any amendments. Not all 
of those amendments have sponsors who really want to make sure they 
want to get voted on.
  In any event, the way the Senate works, the way it has long worked, 
the way it still worked to a significant degree when I first got here 
in 2011 was

[[Page S841]]

that we work it out and we allow Members to offer up amendments. And 
when the body gets tired of it, social pressure, coupled with physical 
exhaustion, usually leads to a natural end to the process.
  But every Member of this body has rights, has certain institutional 
prerogatives and prerogatives accorded under the rules, and the people 
of our States should be afforded representation allowing us to address 
the issues that we think are important.
  Sadly, some of our colleagues are ready to sacrifice those 
prerogatives, those privileges and rights, under the rules and by 
Senate custom and tradition for a $100 billion foreign assistance 
package.
  Now, it is important to remember that the Senate Republican 
conference and our counterparts in the House GOP took a consensus 
opinion, a consensus position a couple months ago that supplemental 
spending should not move without language actually forcing the Biden 
administration to secure the border.
  It was language that was negotiated by a small number of Senators. It 
took a few months to get it negotiated. When we finally saw it, less 
than a week ago, last Sunday at 7 p.m., it didn't achieve that goal. 
And for that reason, that proposal received only four Republican votes 
on the vote on cloture of the motion to proceed.
  Only one-third of Republican Senators voted for cloture on the motion 
to proceed to the supplemental without the border provisions. And this 
doesn't make it our conference's position. Quite to the contrary, it 
makes the position within the Senate GOP supporting cloture a slim 
minority among Republicans.
  And so what we are asking is that we be given the opportunity, those 
of us--most of the Senate Republican conference--who have concerns with 
the bill would like more opportunity to debate and, yes, offer 
amendments to this bill. We need to have that opportunity.
  I am seeking this not just for my own interests, but for that of 
every Member of this body--any Member of this body--who has one or more 
amendments that they would want to be considered.
  Look, we shouldn't have to be supplicants to the majority leader and 
be forced to operate solely in a universe with which he is really 
comfortable. We all have rights to bring these amendments forward, and 
we ought to be able to have them considered.
  So I appreciate my colleagues' support on this motion, and I hope 
everyone can support it, regardless of how you feel on the bill and 
regardless of which political party you belong to. This is for all of 
us.
  And it is important to remember that neither passing this motion nor 
opposing cloture today will kill this bill; rather, it would keep 
debate alive and allow amendments to move forward.
  We should also remember that there is no clock ticking here. This is 
not something that is going to evaporate. We are not going to turn into 
pumpkins if we fail to get this done today or tomorrow or this week. We 
can handle this the way that it should be handled, with great care to 
make sure that we know what is in the bill and to make sure that 
Members, as many of them as possible, have had a chance to be heard on 
it and offer improvements to the bill before we move forward.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have spoken quite a bit about how the 
votes we cast as U.S. Senators for this funding have tremendous 
consequences.
  I have talked about whether or not we deliver this aid, especially to 
Ukraine, is a question of whether or not America will stand by the 
world and stand by its allies.
  How we all decide to vote on this bill could not be more important. 
It was just last night we heard the presumptive Republican nominee for 
President openly encourage Russia to attack our NATO allies. All of us 
in this Chamber--all of us--understand those words have consequences.
  Our friends and adversaries alike listen to what major political 
leaders here in America have to say about issues of global concern, but 
as my colleagues know, our votes matter tremendously as well. Action, 
legislation that actually gets signed into law, $60 billion to support 
our Ukrainian allies, that sends a lot more than a message to Putin; it 
sends badly needed ammunition and weapons to Ukraine so they can put an 
end to Russia's bloody invasion.
  So I urge every one of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
join me not only in sending a message to our friends that they can 
count on America to stand by its word, to our adversaries that they 
cannot invade sovereign democracies unchecked and unanswered, to 
civilians caught in conflict around the world that America will help 
deliver food and medicine and more, but to join me and vote against 
this tabling motion so we can finally take action and show the world 
that Congress is united when it comes to American leadership and 
resolve on the world stage. We have been negotiating for months now 
trying to get this funding over the finish line.
  Let's all recognize that each time we falter, our adversaries have 
not been subtle in making a show of it, claiming that America will not 
do anything to protect its friends and allies.
  This--this is the time to prove them wrong. I said it before; I will 
say it again: Those of us who understand the gravity of this moment are 
ready to stay here as long as it takes to get this done. I hope we can 
soon come together quickly and get this to the finish line as soon as 
possible.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.
  Mr. LEE. My friend and colleague from the State of Washington makes 
the point that we need to show unity. Now, nothing says unity quite 
like shutting out the majority of the minority party from having any 
say in amendments, from having even a single amendment be made pending.
  If what we are after is unity, then we should vote for it and allow 
individual Members to exercise their prerogatives, their rights under 
the Senate rules and by custom, practice, and tradition and precedent 
to make their amendments pending. That is not too much to ask.
  My friend and colleague also just acknowledged that, as in her words, 
we can stay here as long as it takes to get this done. If we are 
respectful to each other's rights, privileges, and prerogatives as U.S. 
Senators, it is going to take more time than this.
  I know many may want to get it done today, and you may feel that way 
especially if you think the bill is just perfect the way it is, but we 
owe it to those we represent to do everything we can to make sure this 
bill is adequately debated and that amendments are considered.

;  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Butler). On this vote, the yeas are 67, 
the nays are 27.
  Three-fifths of Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the 
affirmative, the motion is agreed to.
  Cloture having been invoked, the motion to commit falls as being 
inconsistent with cloture.
  The Senator from Texas.
  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I yield 30 minutes of debate time to the 
manager.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.
  The Senator from Maine.
  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I yield 30 minutes of debate time to 
the senior Senator from South Carolina.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.
  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, there is no good reason to delay the 
security and humanitarian assistance in this national security 
supplemental package any longer.
  Ukraine is running dangerously low on munitions on the eve of the 
second anniversary of Putin's invasion; millions of innocent 
Palestinians in Gaza are suffering daily without access to basic 
necessities; and our allies in the Indo-Pacific are counting on our 
support to counter China's aggression and maintain stability in the 
region.
  None of these priorities can wait months longer without being 
addressed. All of them are vital to our security interests. We need to 
pass this supplemental urgently.
  When Ukrainian officials warn that they are running out of shells and 
bullets, it is not an exaggeration. In the fight for an eastern 
Ukrainian city, the ratio of Russian to Ukrainian artillery fire was 5 
to 1--5 to 1. Ukrainian soldiers are being forced to ration their 
bullets even when enemy soldiers are bearing down on them. That is what 
Ukraine is contending with on the frontlines as we speak.
  Meanwhile, Putin is intensifying his onslaught with the help of Iran 
and North Korea which are more than happy to replenish his stockpiles 
if it means ending world order as we know it. In Gaza, millions of 
innocent civilians have been, for months, enduring unimaginable horrors 
on a daily basis.
  More than 28,000 people have been killed since the start of the war. 
Hundreds of thousands are starving with widespread famine looming. Just 
about everyone is displaced with nowhere else to go, and humanitarian 
assistance getting through the few available checkpoints is nowhere 
close to enough. These people need our help, and it can't arrive soon 
enough.
  Just as we have a responsibility to help Israel defend itself against 
Hamas terrorism, we also have a responsibility to make sure that 
innocent Palestinians caught in the crossfire have access to basic 
necessities--food, water, medical supplies.
  This package also includes important assistance for our allies and 
partners in the Indo-Pacific region in order to counter China's 
aggression in the region. Chinese President Xi has made no secret of 
his desire to take Taiwan by force if need be.
  And just because there are wars going on in the Middle East and 
Europe, it does not mean that we can take our eye off threats brewing 
in Asia and the Indo-Pacific. It is in both our interest and our 
allies' interest for us to stay vigilant and provide support to 
maintain stability in the region.
  Later this week, I will be part of a bipartisan delegation with 14 of 
my colleagues attending the Munich Security

[[Page S843]]

Conference in Germany. And one of the pressing questions among world 
leaders will be: Where does America really stand? Do we still believe 
in defending democracy and freedom? Are we still willing to rally the 
world in standing up to autocrats and authoritarianism?
  They will no doubt be closely watching what we do or fail to do here 
in the next few days. And we ought to be able to say to them: America 
remains the indispensable Nation. America stands with our allies in war 
and in peace. But that depends on Republicans working with Democrats in 
good faith to pass this supplemental package.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.
  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, let's take a moment to take stock of how 
we got here: 3 years of weakness from President Biden. From the very 
beginning, President Biden appeased Russia, he appeased Iran, and he 
appeased China.
  He gave Russia one-sided extensions of arms control treaties. He 
looked the other way at Russian aggression against America in cyber 
space or threats to our friends in Europe.
  With Iran, from the very beginning, he wanted to go back into the 
failed nuclear deal. He refused to stand up to attacks on American 
forces throughout the Middle East that Iran is behind.
  And, from the beginning, with China he begged and pleaded to turn 
down the temperature--the temperature that, I would say, China has been 
turning up for years.
  Then, of course, there was the collapse in Afghanistan, in September 
of 2021, which put all of our enemies around the world on notice that 
President Biden was not up to the task of protecting America or aiding 
our friends.
  Vladimir Putin began to marshal forces on Ukraine's borders a few 
weeks later, and then he invaded 2 years ago.
  For 2 years, President Biden pussyfooted around. He wouldn't give 
Ukraine the weapons it needed to defend itself when they needed it. 
And, to top it off, here at home, he opened our border entirely to an 
invasion of over 10 million illegal aliens.
  So, last fall, when President Biden asked for more than $100 billion 
to try to solve his own failed policies, the Republicans here wanted to 
take the opportunity to try to force an unwilling President to protect 
our border, in addition to aiding our friends. So we engaged in several 
months of negotiations, and, after 4 months, we saw that the Democrats 
are more ideologically invested in open borders than they are a secure 
border or, for that matter, aiding our friends around the world.
  Now, I want to commend Senator Lankford from Oklahoma, who led these 
negotiations. I think he did the very best he could negotiating with 
stubborn counterparties who are ideologically invested in open borders.
  There are some good parts of the bill, but, unfortunately, the bill 
itself wouldn't solve the crisis at our border. And we didn't go down 
this path to pass a bill for its own sake. We wanted to force the hand 
again of an unwilling President to protect our borders. That is why all 
but four Republican Senators and some Democratic Senators opposed that 
legislation.
  So now we have in front of us a bill that spends $95 billion. Much of 
that spending--the defense spending--is needful, and I want to commend 
Senator Collins, who led that part of the negotiations, for doing an 
outstanding job of improving what President Biden sent out in his 
request for defense spending. If this bill doesn't pass into law, it 
should be a template for the future and hopeful legislation that might 
come back to us from the House.
  However, the bill still includes $19 billion in nondefense spending. 
Again, I want to commend Senator Collins for reducing that amount from 
what the administration requested, but that is still $19 billion, 
almost 20 percent of this bill.
  Madam President, $7.9 billion goes to Ukraine for direct budget 
support. I believe that we need to be aiding Ukraine with military 
hardware, ammunition, shells, and tanks. Europe is going to have to do 
more to pick up direct budget assistance to Ukraine.
  Up to $9.2 billion goes for humanitarian aid to Ukraine, to Israel, 
or to other vulnerable populations and communities. We don't know how 
the administration is going to break that down. So some--even much of 
that--could go to Gaza.
  There is no reason for the United States of America to be sending 
humanitarian aid to Gaza. Israel was targeted with vicious atrocities 
on October 7 from Gaza by Hamas, and, no matter the guardrails in 
place, when aid goes to Gaza, Hamas doesn't divert it, doesn't steal 
it, doesn't commandeer it. Hamas and their cronies accept it because 
Hamas is the governing authority in Gaza. The United States did not 
send aid to Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan in World War II. It should 
not be sending it to Gaza during Israel's war for survival.
  There is another $1.6 billion in aid, mostly to post-Soviet states in 
Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Maybe, some of that is useful 
spending, but if you look at the administration's own budget requests, 
they say that also goes to things like climate change resiliency or 
green energy investments.
  Finally, there is $481 million for grants to leftwing globalist NGOs 
whose main mission is not to secure our border but to accelerate the 
flow of illegals into this country.
  Now, I have an amendment that would strike all of this nondefense 
spending from the bill, reducing its cost by $19 billion, which is no 
mean thing when we are spending more than a trillion dollars a year 
than we take in. I would also point out that even if we didn't just put 
that money toward deficit reduction, it could also go to, say, three 
Virginia-class submarines for our own military, more than 170 F-35 
stealth fighters, or more than 5,000 precision strike missiles. But 
Senator Schumer won't allow a vote on this amendment or other 
amendments.
  Now, I hope, when this legislation leaves the Senate and goes to the 
House, that the House of Representatives--in particular, the Speaker of 
the House--can sit down and negotiate directly with President Biden and 
get the kind of concessions that President Biden must make to address 
his own failures to secure our border.
  And, in that case, we will not only be able to protect our own border 
but also help our friends around the world who are in the crosshairs, 
thanks to Joe Biden's failures and his weakness.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.
;   Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to 
discuss a matter of enormous consequence that is not being adequately 
covered in the mainstream media nor here in the Senate, and that is, 
right now, today, in Gaza, we are witnessing one of the worst 
humanitarian disasters in modern history. It is unfolding before our 
very eyes, and we must not run away from that reality.
  I am very sorry to say, but we in the United States are deeply 
complicit in what is happening in Gaza. What we do in Congress right 
now could well determine whether tens of thousands of people live or 
die.
  Let us very briefly review what has happened in the last 4 months. On 
October 7, Hamas launched a horrific terrorist attack that killed 1,200 
innocent Israelis and took more than 230 hostages and more than 100 of 
those hostages still remain in captivity today. That is what started 
this war.
  As I have said many times, Israel has the right to defend itself 
against Hamas terrorism, but it does not have the right to go to war 
against the entire Palestinian people. And that, tragically, is what we 
are seeing. As of today, Israel's military campaign has killed more 
than 27,000 Palestinians and injured some 68,000, two-thirds of whom 
are women and children.
  Unbelievably, 1.7 million people have been driven from their homes, 
nearly 80 percent of the population. That is more than twice the 
population of my own State of Vermont. These people displaced have no 
understanding as to where they will go tomorrow or whether, in fact, 
they will ever return to their communities. That is where they are now: 
pushed out of their homes, hungry, desperate, no understanding of where 
they will be in the future.
  The devastation caused by Israeli bombardments is unprecedented in 
modern history, some 70 percent of the housing units in Gaza being 
damaged or destroyed. The Israeli bombing attacks have destroyed most 
of the infrastructure in Gaza. There is no electricity there and very 
little clean water. There are virtually no places where people can buy 
bread or other basic necessities as most of the bakeries have been 
destroyed or shut down. Raw sewage is now running into the streets, and 
communication is extremely difficult because there is little or no cell 
phone service.
  Despite the tens of thousands of Palestinians who have been injured, 
there are no fully functional hospitals in Gaza, and just one in three 
is operational at all.
  Amid repeated attacks on healthcare facilities, doctors and nurses 
with extraordinary courage are bravely working to save lives even with 
inadequate and sporadic electricity or basic medical supplies.
  Israel bombing and the onerous restrictions placed on aid entering 
Gaza

[[Page S847]]

means that only a tiny fraction of the food, water, medicine, and fuel 
that is needed can get into Gaza.
  And even when supplies get across the border, very little of that aid 
can reach beyond the immediate area around the Rafah crossing from 
Egypt.
  Let us take a deep breath and understand what all of this means for 
the men, women, and children who are in Gaza today, right now.
  Not only have they been driven from their homes, not only have those 
homes been damaged or destroyed, not only are they unable to access the 
medical care or the clean water they need, but unbelievably and 
horrifyingly, hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza today face 
starvation.
  Let me repeat: Hundreds of thousands of children face starvation. The 
United Nations says that 1 in 10 children under the age of 5 in Gaza is 
already malnourished, and the entire population is at imminent risk of 
famine.
  What every physician knows is that malnutrition in small children 
causes permanent physical and cognitive damage. It stays with them for 
their entire lives.
  In other words, even if the war ended today, large numbers of 
children in Gaza will have suffered physically from what has happened 
for the rest of their lives, and that is not to mention the 
extraordinary psychological damage that these kids have gone through.
  Can you imagine what it means to be 5 years old, seeing buildings 
collapsing, people dying, suffering from hunger and thirst? That is 
what these kids are going through today.
  If nothing changes, we will soon have hundreds of thousands of 
children literally starving to death before our very eyes, and believe 
it or not--believe it or not--the situation could become even worse.
  Right now, 1.4 million people--more than half of the population of 
Gaza--are squeezed into the area around Rafah, right up against the 
Egyptian border. Rafah was a town of just 250,000 people before the 
war; now there are 1.4 million people there--more than five times the 
original population. These people are packed into crowded U.N. shelters 
or sleeping out in tents. It is a daily struggle for them to find food 
or water.
  And in the midst of all of this horror and suffering, Israeli Prime 
Minister Netanyahu, the leader of Israel's extreme-right wing 
government, has announced that Israel will soon launch a major ground 
offensive against Rafah where 1.4 million people are located.
  What that means is that Netanyahu will soon be forcing these people, 
already living in extreme desperation, to evacuate once again, and 
nobody--nobody--has any idea where they will go.
  These families, already exhausted, traumatized, and hungry will once 
again be displaced with no plan as to how they will survive.
  I struggle to find words for this cruelty. And let me state once 
again that what is happening in Gaza now is funded with U.S. taxpayer 
dollars. These are our bombs and our military equipment that is being 
used. We are complicit. This is not just an Israeli war; it is an 
American war.
  Prime Minister Netanyahu says that all of this is necessary. He says 
that Israel will only accept ``total victory'' in this campaign. Yet 
asked recently what total victory would look like, he said, chillingly, 
that it is like smashing a glass ``into small pieces, and then you 
continue to smash it into even smaller pieces and you continue hitting 
them,'' Netanyahu.
  The question that we must ask ourselves is, how many more children 
and innocent people in Gaza will be smashed by Netanyahu in the 
process? And why is the United States helping to fund this humanitarian 
disaster?
  It is quite clear that beyond total destruction of Gaza, Netanyahu 
has no plan. This week, President Biden acknowledged the severity of 
the crisis. He said that Israel's response in Gaza ``has been over the 
top,'' and added that ``there are a lot of innocent people who are 
starving. There are a lot of innocent people who are in trouble and 
dying. And it's got to stop.''
  The President is absolutely right. It does have to stop. But if that 
is the case, then why in God's name are we now contemplating 
legislation that provides $10 billion to the Israeli war machine to 
continue Netanyahu's war?
  President Biden and Secretary of State Blinken have been trying to 
negotiate an agreement where Israel pauses its military operation, 
Hamas releases the remaining hostages, and massive humanitarian aid 
comes in to help desperate people. We all hope that this deal comes 
together, but Netanyahu is resisting this proposal.
  In my view, he is trying to prolong the war in order to cling to 
power. Most Israelis rightly blame him for creating this crisis and 
want him out. But if Netanyahu prolongs the war, he can avoid 
accountability for his disastrous leadership. And that is why Netanyahu 
is ignoring almost everything that President Biden and Secretary 
Blinken are saying.
  He, this week, dismissed the hostage deal as ``delusional'' and 
brushed aside U.S. concerns about expanding the ground offensive to 
southern Gaza.
  There is a simple question that must be asked. How does it happen 
that despite waging a horrific war, which has caused massive suffering, 
despite ignoring the wishes of the President of the United States and, 
in fact, virtually the entire world community, how does it happen that 
the U.S. Congress is about to send another $10 billion of unrestricted 
military aid to Israel, no strings attached?

  It is beyond comprehension to me that Congress would reward Netanyahu 
even while he ignores everything the President of the United States 
says. Netanyahu is the leader of the most rightwing government in 
Israel's history, a man who has dedicated his political career to 
killing the prospects of a two-state solution, and yet this bill will 
give him a blank check paid for by the American taxpayer.
  It is hard to believe, but that is exactly what this bill will do. 
And what is even harder to understand is that in the midst of this 
almost unprecedented humanitarian crisis, this legislation before us 
actually contains a prohibition on funding for UNRWA, the largest U.N. 
Agency operating in Gaza and the backbone of the humanitarian aid 
operation.
  UNRWA is the organization that actually gets food throughout Gaza. 
Israel's allegations against UNRWA are serious, and they are being 
investigated seriously. But you don't starve 2 million people because 
of the alleged actions of 12 UNRWA employees.
  The whole world is watching. Netanyahu is starving hundreds of 
thousands of children. We, in America, cannot be complicit in this 
atrocity.
  As long as this bill contains money to fund Netanyahu's cruel war, it 
must be defeated.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.
  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this will take a little bit of time. Do 
you want to speak, sir? OK.
  So I want to explain sort of where we started and where we are at. 
Those of us old enough to remember 2001, that was a very bad day for 
America, and it will stick with me forever. I remember being here, 
during the attack, in Washington and asking myself: What can I do to 
make sure this never happens again? We did some things, made some 
mistakes, did some things right, but I will remind you at the end of 
this discussion that before the attack, the lights were blinking.
  When the Taliban took over in Afghanistan and started killing women 
in soccer stadiums for sport and blowing up Buddhist statues, to think 
that wouldn't affect us was pretty naive.
  So there is sort of a debate in my party, to be honest with you, 
about America First, what does that mean, and isolationism.
  Isolationism sounds good; doesn't work, never has, never will. When 
people are willing to do horrible things to others in the name of 
religion or a master race, to think that they will leave you alone is 
just really very naive.
  So when Hitler wanted to kill all the Jews because they were an 
inferior race, for a long time America sat on the sidelines. Voices 
like Lindbergh and others saying: This is not our fight, no more 
foreign wars. Well, you wind up allowing the guy to get stronger. You 
could probably have stopped him dozens of times, but nobody wanted to 
get involved because of the aftermath of World War I.
  Well, what did we learn? Allowing Hitler to get stronger and not 
standing up to his abuse of the Jewish people

[[Page S848]]

and his desire for a master race led to about 50 million people getting 
killed and hundreds of thousands of Americans getting killed because of 
World War II.
  So America First--America First was a slogan being said in the 1930s. 
President Trump talks about America First. It is different to me.
  If America First is isolationism, count me out; I don't believe it 
is. If America First is weak, count me out; I don't believe it is.
  So America First and strong, what does it mean? It doesn't mean you 
don't care about the other parts of the world, but you have to get your 
own backyard right, and you do expect other people to carry their fair 
share of burden.
  That is what it means to me, and it means having a strong military, 
not a weak military. It means letting people know if you screw around 
with America, you will regret doing it. Just ask Soleimani. But you 
can't; he is dead. He had blood on his hands, and President Trump saw 
that his reign of terror ended. That is being strong. So that is sort 
of where we are at in our party right now. I am going to jump from 2001 
to 2011. So, in 2001, America united. We were hurt as a nation. The 
country went through a lot of turmoil. Three thousand of our citizens, 
almost, were killed in various ways. But terrorists, if they could kill 
3 million of us, they would have.

  We go to the Mideast. We make mistakes. The source of the problem is 
Afghanistan. Bush decides to get involved in Iraq. Saddam Hussein was 
truly a bad guy, but we can debate whether or not we should have done 
that. But the one thing that I said, Senator McCain said, and Senator 
Lieberman said: We are down to about 10,000 troops. We need an 
insurance policy force to make sure that the forces we are trying to 
contain--radical Islam in Iraq--do not come back. So President Obama 
had an option of leaving 10,000, and he chose to pull the plug. And 
here is what I said: I feel all we have worked for, fought for, and 
sacrificed for is pretty much in jeopardy by today's announcement. I 
hope I am wrong and the President is right, but ``I fear this decision 
has set in motion events that will come back to haunt our country.''
  That is what I said when President Obama wanted to pull the plug on 
Iraq. This is what Senator McCain said:

       This decision will be viewed as a strategic victory for our 
     enemies in the Middle East, especially the Iranian regime, 
     which has worked relentlessly to ensure a full withdrawal of 
     U.S. troops from Iraq.

  Senator Lieberman:

       This failure puts at the greater risk all that so many 
     Americans and Iraqis have fought, sacrificed, and, in the 
     thousands of cases, gave their lives to achieve: an Iraq that 
     is self-governing, self-defending, and aligned with the 
     responsible nations of the world in the fight against Islamic 
     extremism and terrorism.

  My last line was:

       But I fear this decision has set in motion events that will 
     come back to haunt us.

  Hoping I was wrong. Here is what happened: We pulled the plug on 
Iraq. The JV team called ISIS runs wild, and the carnage that followed 
was devastating to the world, the attacks after the withdrawal in 2011. 
In 2015, 130 people killed in Paris by attacks that came from the 
caliphate that was established after our withdrawal. In 2016, 86 people 
killed in Nice, France. I can go on and on and on--2017, Istanbul, 
Turkey. Just on and on, carnage by the thousands throughout the world, 
and it came to get us here too. The Orlando, FL, Nightclub attack was 
inspired by somebody who pledged allegiance to ISIS. You just remember 
all of the beheadings in Syria. They took large parts of Iraq and Syria 
after the withdrawal.
  Everything we were worried about actually came true, even greater 
than I thought. Yazidi genocide, the Yazidi people were raped and 
murdered by the tens of thousands all because everybody was ready to 
leave Iraq. That was in 2011.
  Let's fast forward to 2021. After having left Iraq, saw what 
happened, had to go back in, we decided to pull out of Afghanistan 
where it all started, 2021. So if you had told me in 2001 we would 
allow the Taliban to come back 20 years later, I would not have 
believed it. But we did. We wanted 2,500--that is what I wanted, more 
if you needed it--to keep the country from falling apart, a residual, 
follow-along force.
  Secretary Blinken said:

       If 20 years and hundreds of billions of dollars in support, 
     equipment, and training did not suffice, why would another 
     year, another five, another ten [make a difference]?

  Let me answer that question. If after all that blood and treasure we 
pulled the plug because we are tired based on the passage of time and 
the enemy comes back and they take over, then other people in the world 
will see us as weak. So, Secretary Blinken, you didn't understand the 
ripple effect of allowing Afghanistan to fall back into the hands of 
terrorists, and President Biden, against sound military advice, you 
chose to pull the plug. Ten years earlier, President Obama pulled the 
plug on Iraq--the rise of ISIS. Apparently, it is hard for us to learn 
much at all.

       Because it's the right one--it's the right decision for our 
     people. The right one for our brave servicemembers who have 
     risked their lives serving our nation. And it's the right one 
     for America.

  He is talking about pulling out of Afghanistan. President Biden, it 
was a horribly bad decision.
  But he is not the only one. Some of my best friends were sort of in 
that mindset.
  ``I write to express my support for President Trump's plan for the 
prompt withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan,'' Senator Hawley.
  ``After the loss of over 2,000 American servicemembers and thousands 
of others injured in action, I agreed it was past time to get our 
troops out of Afghanistan,'' Senator Marshall--really good friends.
  All I can say is, it is not when we leave, it is what we leave 
behind. So we pulled the plug, jointly, on Afghanistan. President 
Trump, at the time of the end of his term, had about 2,500 
servicemembers still. He was going to leave them there, I hope and 
think, but at the end of the day, there was a plan to withdraw by May. 
I think he put in place it was conditional, and the Taliban didn't 
abide by any of the conditions. So when President Biden announced he 
was going to get out, I think, on May 1, ``Getting out of Afghanistan 
is a wonderful and positive thing to do. I planned to withdraw on May 
1st, and we should keep as close to that schedule as possible.'' So 
that was President Trump. And I can't remember exactly when we got out, 
but it wasn't very much after that.

  So 20 years, almost to the day, after 9/11, you have got Republicans 
and Democrats saying: Enough already. Let's leave--not understanding 
why we should stay. And apparently leaving Iraq in 2011, nobody really 
remembered that much at all.
  So the Secretary of Defense said: I don't have any regrets about 
supporting the decision to leave Afghanistan. He really probably needs 
to resign, quite frankly. I like the man personally, but he has been so 
wrong so often, I have lost all confidence in his ability to make good, 
sound decisions. And when he speaks, nobody listens. So the idea that 
he would defend what happened in Afghanistan, the withdrawal, ``I have 
no regrets'' is a bit disappointing because I have a ton of them.
  So what happened after we withdrew or announced we were leaving? 
Thirteen servicemembers were killed in the disaster that was a 
withdrawal. And now the talking point is, that was a disaster. That was 
embarrassing. We shouldn't have done it that way. Well, I will just 
give you my two cents' worth: There is no good way to do a dumb thing. 
What was dumb was to leave Afghanistan and allow ISIS-K and ISIS and 
al-Qaida to come back when a fairly small force compared to what we 
have done in the past could have held the country together. So it was 
just carnage, the 13 brave Americans killed at Abbey Gate.
  What happened after our withdrawal? Remember the C-17 going down the 
runway with Afghans jumping on the wheel, the wings, babies being 
passed over the wire to soldiers. It was just really hard for me to 
sleep, quite frankly, for days after that. And the Veterans' 
Administration had a real spike in assistance from veterans because all 
those who fought and lost loved ones and sacrificed in Afghanistan were 
pretty upset.
  So that was in 2021. Ten years after we withdrew from Iraq and ISIS 
stormed the world, we made the same stupid decision to withdraw in 
Afghanistan. The rest is history. The Taliban has taken over.

[[Page S849]]

  Now, the question is to Secretary Blinken: Did our withdrawal set in 
motion bad things? I would say it did.
  February 24, 2022, Russia invades Ukraine. Many of us believe that 
when we pulled the plug on Afghanistan, it showed a lack of resolve, 
and all the bad guys got bolder. So you will never convince me that our 
decision in 2021 did not encourage and lead to aggression by Russia in 
2022.
  Now, we wanted preinvasion sanctions--Senator Menendez, Blumenthal, I 
think Whitehouse. We had a package of sanctions to hit Russia as the 
buildup was coming. You could see the amassing of Russian forces. And 
we said: Why don't we tell Russia right now, here is what comes your 
way if you invade? And many of us wanted to give lethal weapons to 
Ukraine before the invasion to deter Putin.
  Well, the administration said no to preinvasion sanctions. They said 
no to sending any weapons. They didn't want to be provocative. Well, it 
didn't work. They invaded. And your effort to deter the invasion never 
occurred.
  Once the war started, many of my Democratic friends, to their credit, 
joined all of us to help Ukraine the best we could. We were arguing for 
military assistance that would change the tide of battle. We were told 
that Kyiv would fall in 2 or 3 weeks. Well, they were wrong. The 
Ukrainians have been fighting like tigers. They have put a hurting on 
the Russian military. And for months after the invasion, I, along with 
many others--Democrats included--were pushing the Biden administration 
to help. How do you fight the Russians? You need more tanks. It took 10 
months to get the first delivery of M1 Abrams tanks after Secretary 
Austin opposed tanks, 1 year and 7 months to get to ATACMS. They 
resisted HIMARS, long-range artillery. They have yet to get the F-16s. 
So every time we would talk about a weapon system that would change the 
course of battle, it was like pulling teeth. And it is amazing the 
Ukrainians have done as well as they have.
  But the people who decided not to impose preinvasion sanctions, the 
people who wanted to slow-walk military assistance are the same people 
who wanted to get out of Afghanistan, the same people who wanted to 
withdraw from Iraq. I don't mean to be overly critical, but they lost 
me a long time ago. Devastation in Ukraine, great country, proud 
people, it has just been terrible.
  Putin, by the way, is now an indicted international war criminal for 
kidnapping and stealing Ukrainian children, and this is over 2 years 
into the war.
  What else has happened since 9/11? There was a defense budget 
approved by this body against my wishes to produce a military budget 
that was below inflation. At a time when you had a war with Russia and 
Ukraine, you had the rise of radical Islamic terrorism, you had Iran 
pushing everybody around in the Mideast and China threatening their 
neighbors, so the response in 2024, the fiscal year 2024 budget, in 
light of all of these threats, to pass a military budget below 
inflation, what are we thinking? Have we learned nothing from 9/11?
  So, everybody talks about China, for good reason. We are not at war 
with China, thank God, but I, along with many of my colleagues, want to 
be tough on China. Well, if you want to be tough on China, you have to 
have credibility.
  The budget we passed over my objection, which was agreed to by the 
former Speaker of the House, a Republican, has put us on track to have 
less ships in the Navy by 2030 than we have today. And you want to be 
tough on China?
  The Navy tells us they need about 450 manned and unmanned vessels to 
deal with the threats we face throughout the world. We passed a 
military budget that goes from 292 ships in 2030 to 290, not 450.
  What does it take to get 450 ships in the Navy? Five percent spending 
above inflation for about a decade. We are spending below inflation, so 
I don't think we are ever going to get there.
  What is China doing? Well, they have 370 ships. By 2030, they are 
going to have 435. Today, we have 292; the Chinese navy is 370. By 
2030, they are going to have 435, and we are going to have 290. Well, 
we must come up with some super-duper ships. We are going in the wrong 
direction.
  What are we thinking as a nation? How do you expect to deter China 
when you are reducing your military spending below inflation, you are 
reducing the number of ships available to help our friends in Taiwan 
and throughout the world, and they are dramatically increasing their 
navy? Do you think they feel deterred? I don't think so.
  So I really don't want to hear any more talk about being tough on 
China until we pass a budget that shows we actually mean what we say.
  That is 2022. We have Russia invade Ukraine. In 2021, we get out of 
Afghanistan. In 2022, Russia invades Ukraine. In 2023, we pass a budget 
below inflation. So what also happened in 2023? On October 7, Hamas 
attacks Israel.
  Now, I heard my colleague Senator Sanders talk about we shouldn't be 
sending any more aid to Israel. I respectfully disagree. This was the 
largest loss of life to the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas is 
the perpetrator of the attack, and there was this belief--somewhat in 
Israel and somewhat in America--that you could keep this caged tiger 
somewhat fed, but they wouldn't bite you. That proved not to be true. 
They openly talk about destroying the Jewish people.
  Israel pulled out of Gaza I think in 2005 or 2008. I can't remember 
the day. It wasn't very long until Hamas took over, and anybody who 
wanted to make peace with Israel, they killed--Hamas did. They have an 
underground tunnel complex, and that money they used to build the 
tunnels is pretty much all the aid the world has given them. And all of 
a sudden, Israel is the bad guy.
  I hate that so many people are being killed, but Hamas uses the 
Palestinian people in Gaza as human shields. They want Israel to kill 
more of their people because they think it helps their cause to isolate 
Israel.
  I have been to Israel more times than I can count. I think the idea 
is a professional military force. And here's what is so ironic: The 
Jewish State, Israel, if they wanted to, could kill everybody in 
Palestine. They have the ability to do that. The Palestinians would 
love to kill everybody in Israel; they just don't have the ability. The 
one that could do it has chosen not to; the one with limited 
capabilities is willing to bet the farm on killing as many as they can.
  What an upside-down world we are after 9/11. If somebody in a 
Parliament had made the speech that Senator Sanders just made, 
criticizing America for our response after being viciously attacked, I 
think we would have taken offense to that. And we are only talking 
about October. We are talking about months, not years. There were 24 
brigades that Hamas had. They are down to the last four or five. They 
are hiding among a million Palestinians. I don't blame Israel for 
wanting to destroy them all.
  I actually support Saudi Arabia and Israel recognizing each other and 
trying to find a better future for the Palestinians. That better future 
cannot include Hamas.
  The First Minister of Northern Ireland, which is a beautiful place, 
said something--I really don't know her; I just thought it was an odd 
thing to say--that one day Hamas will be seen as part of the solution. 
I am not so sure that is the case. I don't ever see Hamas being 
considered part of the solution anytime.
  So that is 2023. What else is happening in 2023 and now 2024?
  So Secretary Austin came before our committee.
  We are helping Israel. There is money for Israel in this package, and 
I want to help Israel. There is money for Ukraine in this package, and 
I want to help Ukraine. There is money for Taiwan in this package, and 
I want to help them too.
  I asked Secretary Austin:

       Is it a red line for Iran to orchestrate an attack on our 
     forces that kills an American in Syria or Iraq. . . . Can you 
     say that?

  This was weeks before they actually did this.

       [AUSTIN:] I think Iran should be held accountable for the 
     activities of [Iran].
       [GRAHAM:] Can we say to Iran, if you escalate the second 
     front, if you activate Hezbollah against the State of Israel 
     to create a second front, we will come after you?
       [AUSTIN:] Whether or not we attack Iran because of a 
     decision on the part of Lebanese Hezbollah, that is a 
     Presidential decision.

  Back to my original question.

[[Page S850]]

  I wanted him to tell the world, so the Iranians could hear, that if 
your proxies kill an American, we are coming after you, not just the 
proxies. Well, unfortunately, it wasn't long after that exchange that 
these three brave Americans were killed in 2024 by an Iranian militia.
  So 2020, we get attacked. We say: Never again. In 2024, Iranian 
militia are killing American servicemembers in Jordan and then almost 
200 attacks since the invasion of Hamas against Israel. And we are 
helping Israel, and Hamas and all the terrorists throughout the world, 
including Iran, are trying to pay us back.

  After 9/11, I didn't think this headline would be possible: ``Iran 
closer than ever to weaponizing uranium, building nuclear bomb.''
  So 20-some years after 9/11, we have a budget below inflation. We 
have pulled out of Iraq; 10 years later, pulled out of Afghanistan. 
Russia is trying to dismember Ukraine. Hamas attacked Israel with 
ferocity and barbarity beyond what the Nazis did. How could all this 
happen? And Iran, the ``Great Satan,'' religious Nazis, on the verge of 
getting a nuclear weapon? What the hell happened?
  Now we are going to turn to something else that happened. September 
11, 2001. I don't know how many illegal crossings we had at the 
southern border, but it wasn't that big of an issue. We did immigration 
reform with President Bush, trying to secure our border. So on 
September 11, 2001, if you had told people that in 2024 we would have a 
border that was completely broken, wide open, with terrorism on the 
rise, fentanyl coming in to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans 
every year, rabid Islamic extremists on the Terrorist Watchlist pouring 
through the border, nobody would have believed you. What happened? Did 
we learn anything from 9/11? Apparently not.
  When President Trump left office in December of 2020, we had the 
lowest illegal crossings in 40 years. For fiscal year 2020, it was 
458,000; 2021, 1.7 million; 2022, 2.4 million; 2023, 2.5 million. We 
are on track for fiscal year 2024 for 3.6 million. Over 9 million have 
come across since President Biden has been in office. He inherited the 
most secure border we have had in a long time.
  We have been talking about what to do. In April of 2023, Secretary 
Mayorkas said: We need policy changes to remove individuals who do not 
qualify for asylum. The asylum system needs to be reformed from top to 
bottom--policy changes.
  To Senator Lankford's credit and Senator Murphy's and others, they 
have been working for a very long time to come up with a border 
security proposal that would change asylum, and I thought they did a 
pretty good job, to be honest with you, but there was more to be done. 
The bipartisan bill was a serious effort. It had many good things but 
not quite everything I wanted, for sure.
  So, you see, from 2020 to 2023, there has been a 300-percent increase 
in the encounters, and 172 people on the Terrorist Watchlist came 
through in fiscal year 2023, the end of September of last year.
  Here is the one that just blows me away: parole. During the Trump and 
Obama Presidencies, parole was granted at about 5,600 per year. In 
fiscal year 2022, the Biden administration paroled 795,000 people; in 
fiscal year 2023, 802,000. We are well on our way to a million this 
time. Again, Presidents Obama and Trump paroled 5,623 on average per 
year. President Biden paroled 795,561 in fiscal year 2022 alone.
  Now, what am I talking about when it comes to parole? Here is the 
law. The DHS Secretary, in his ``discretion,'' may parole into the 
United States temporarily, under such conditions as he may prescribe, 
only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or 
significant public benefit, any alien applying for admission to the 
United States.
  Urgent humanitarian reasons. Significant public benefit. Case-by-case 
basis. That law has been completely obliterated.
  The bipartisan bill that is trying to rein in the abuse of parole--
they did a pretty good job but not enough for me. That is why I wanted 
to make sure we would debate the bipartisan bill the same way we did, 
the Gang of 8, which I was part of. That was on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate for a couple weeks. You have to defend your product.
  I want to put a cap on parole.
  And here is what is coming: We are going to start a parole watchlist. 
This is a discretionary decision. You don't need to change the law; you 
just need to quit obliterating the law and follow it. So I am going to 
track every week how many people the Biden administration paroles 
because it is supposed to be done case by case--5,600 per year for 
Trump and Obama and now about 800,000 a year. Clearly these people in 
the Biden administration want to wave in a lot of folks. And when I 
hear Secretary Mayorkas say he doesn't bear any of the blame, that is 
offensive because when you wave in that many, word gets out that if you 
show up, you are going to get in.
  You have an 85-percent chance, if you show up to the U.S. border, of 
being allowed in as of last month. As long as people believe there is 
an 85-percent chance of getting into the country, they will never stop 
coming.
  The Biden administration repealed 90-something Executive orders. They 
canceled the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy. Anything Trump did, they 
changed because they didn't want to be like Trump.
  Well, you have accomplished that goal. You are not like President 
Trump when it comes to securing our border, and I think that is one of 
the reasons President Biden is going to lose.
  The bottom line is you have a pretty secure border. You tore up all 
the infrastructure President Trump put in place, and you want to blame 
him. Give me a break.
  You are taking parole and abusing the law, and when an 85-percent 
chance of getting in the country continues, you are never going to stop 
the flow. So don't tell me, Secretary Mayorkas, that your policies had 
nothing to do with this tsunami--I dare say, invasion--of America.
  And it is just not people. It is drugs. In 2021, there were 71,238 
people who died from a fentanyl overdose. We have seized enough 
fentanyl coming through the southern border to kill 2\1/2\ billion 
people. Most of it is coming through China. It comes through the 
southern border. It is literally an attack on America, and we are not 
doing much to respond. There was a provision in the bipartisan bill 
that addressed the fentanyl problem. It was pretty good but not 
enough--again, enough fentanyl to kill everybody in America and 2,700 
pounds were seized in one fiscal year alone. In one fiscal year, there 
was enough to kill everybody in America. How could that happen after 9/
11?
  After 9/11, we created a Terrorist Watchlist. I wish we had had one 
before 9/11. Now, after 9/11, one of the things we wanted to do was to 
kind of watch people we thought were going to be terrorists or 
associated with terrorists. Here is what has happened: In 2017, we 
found two. In 2018, we found six. In 2019, zero. In 2020, three. In 
2021, 15, when we withdraw from Afghanistan. In 2022, Russia invades 
Ukraine, 98. In 2023, Hamas attacks Israel, 172. There have been 50 
already since September. All of these people are probably up to no 
good.
  CNN, not FOX, in 2023: ``Smuggler with ties to ISIS helped migrants 
enter U.S. from Mexico, raising alarm bells across government.''
  After we pulled out of Iraq in 2011 and the JV team became ISIS and 
destroyed thousands of people's lives--destroyed the Yazidis people and 
created attacks on our homeland--they are still in business smuggling 
people into our country. How could that happen after 9/11? How could 
that happen after 2011? Well, it is.
  This is a San Diego field office warning: Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and 
Hezbollah are coming across in this area--fighting-aged males 
associated with these jihadist groups. How could that happen in October 
of 2023?
  On December 5, 2023--just a couple of months ago--this is the FBI 
Director's testimony before our committee in responding to a question I 
asked:

       While there may have been times over the years where 
     individual threats could have been higher here or there than 
     where they might be right now, I have never seen a time where 
     all the threats or so many of the threats are elevated all at 
     exactly the same time.

  So we take a border security proposal. I appreciate the people who 
worked on it. You did some good things. We had one cloture vote, and

[[Page S851]]

they pulled the plug. The fix was in on both sides here. We didn't 
really have a serious debate to fix the broken border.
  The elevated threat strain is real. We don't want an October 7-type 
attack coming against America like it did Israel. We don't want another 
9/11. We have our military spending below inflation. We have a border 
that is completely broken. We are being poisoned by fentanyl coming in 
from China. Hamas has killed more Jews since the Holocaust. The Taliban 
is now in charge of Afghanistan, and the Iranians, through their 
proxies, are trying to kill Americans and have killed Americans to 
drive us out of the Middle East. Other than that, we are in good shape.
  How does this happen? What are we thinking as a nation? With my good 
friend John McCain, we were wrong some. We probably had too many troops 
for too long. I have, by no means, been perfect, but I think I and many 
others have been more right than wrong. So we have to ask ourselves as 
a country: How could it be that we find ourselves in this national 
security nightmare, and isn't it time to make corrections? I will talk 
about that in a minute. But the hits, they keep on coming.
  ``60 Minutes'' did a program. If you would watch it, it would really 
make you mad. There is a hole in the fence near San Diego that people 
just literally walk through. The Biden administration decided not to 
plug the hole. It got on ``60 Minutes,'' and I think Mexico has plugged 
the hole.

       The number of migrants arriving at the southern border is 
     unprecedented . . . So what is the fastest growing group 
     among them? Chinese migrants . . . We saw large groups, 
     including many from the middle class, come through a 4-foot 
     gap at the end of a border fence 60 miles east of San Diego.

  That is according to ``60 Minutes'' a couple of weeks ago.
  How is this happening, and why are we letting it continue?
  In December, there were 302,034 border encounters. This is the most 
of any month on record--ever. So when Secretary Mayorkas says they bear 
no responsibility, I respectfully disagree.
  The problem you have, Mr. Secretary, is that you have abused parole, 
as 85 percent of the people who show up get in. You have waved in over 
2\1/2\ billion people when Obama and Trump had 5,600 on average. You 
have created the magnet. You have made people believe that, if they get 
here, they are going to come and stay. You really don't deport anybody. 
You have been as weak as water when it comes to securing our border.
  You want to blame Congress. I will be the first to say, Congress 
should do better. I had been working on comprehensive immigration 
reform with Senator Kennedy, I think, during the first Bush term in 
2006, I believe it was--maybe it was the second term--and on the Gang 
of 8 bill in 2013. I had been working on it, trying. It is just hard. I 
understand, but we can't stop trying. The problem we have today is that 
the policy choices of the Biden administration have obliterated border. 
You could bring about control of the border far better than we have 
today if you would just re-implement policies that were working and 
just get over the fact that Trump did it and actually put the American 
people first.

  As to the product that was produced by the bipartisan working group, 
thank you very much for your hard work. I know it is not easy.
  Senator Lankford, on our side, is one of the smartest people I know 
and is one of the most honorable people I know.
  I think you produced a good product on asylum and good stuff on 
parole. There are some things that needed to be changed. As to the 
``break glass'' 5,000--when you can shut down the border when you have 
5,000 a day--it probably should have been 1,000. There are a bunch of 
things. There needs to be a cap on parole to make sure it is not abused 
in the future.
  There are a bunch of things we could have done to make the bill 
better. The reason I am going to vote no to this package is because I 
have been telling people for months now that I want to help Ukraine; I 
want to help Israel; I want to help Taiwan; but we have got to help 
ourselves first. The effort to help ourselves, I thought, was 
halfhearted and not consistent with what we have done in the past to 
try to pass an immigration bill. I thought the fix was in. So the 
border part we did in one day. We are jumping now to the supplemental 
dealing with aid to our allies.
  I am going to stick with what I have been saying: I have been to 
Israel and Saudi Arabia, I think, four times in the last 8 weeks. I 
love our friends in Israel. We have got $10 billion in there for them. 
We have got money that is needed to help Ukraine keep the fight going. 
We have money to harden Taiwan. It all makes perfect sense to me, but 
we can't do that until we secure our own border.
  So I am going to vote no, being consistent with what I have been 
saying, and I am not going to Munich. It is the first time, other than 
being in cycle or sick, that I miss Munich. We have Codel McCain where 
we honor John McCain--Senator Whitehouse and myself. He came up to me--
you know, Sheldon Whitehouse is a wonderful man--saying he may not go 
to Munich if we don't do something on Ukraine.
  I said: Well, I can withstand the wrath of the Europeans, but I can't 
withstand going home and telling the American people--South 
Carolinians, particularly--that we have done a good job on their 
behalf, and we have not. So I will not be going to Munich. I will be 
going to our border.
  While you are over in Munich, talking to our friends and our allies, 
I will be at the border. You can tell our friends and allies that I 
want to help them, but we have a national security nightmare in our own 
backyard, and I intend to do all I can to get a better outcome. I meant 
it then, and I mean it now.
  Finally, here is what the FBI Director said:

       Post October 7, the attack by Hamas against Israel, you see 
     a veritable rogues' gallery of terrorist organizations 
     calling for attacks against us, [the United States].

  They want to attack us as payback for helping Israel. So every 
problem we had before October 7 is now worse, and they want to come 
after us because we dare to help our friends in Israel. The threat 
level has gone to a whole other level since October 7.
  This is the FBI Director, just a few weeks ago, telling us that the 
October 7 attack, orchestrated by Hamas against Israel, has made us 
more vulnerable to attack, and people want to come pay us back because 
we helped Israel.
  I will sort of end where I began.
  ``Zero Dark Thirty'' was a story about the invasion of Afghanistan 
after 9/11, but the folklore now is that there were blinking lights 
everywhere before the attack on September 11 and that we sort of missed 
it.
  So I asked the FBI Director that question:

       Do you see blinking lights against American national 
     security interests? Do you see blinking lights that you 
     equate with a threat to our homeland being attacked?
       I see blinking lights everywhere I turn.

  So, folks, after 9/11, in 2024, the world is on fire. We need to help 
our friends. They have many problems. Israel has got its back against 
the wall. We need to help them with military aid. I intend to do that 
and will do that. Russia invaded Ukraine after we withdrew from 
Afghanistan. Americans are being killed by Iranian proxies. I am not 
only willing to help our allies, I am going to insist that when we get 
back to appropriating--if we ever do--we get rid of this stupid budget 
deal that has the spending below inflation. That is just insane given 
the state of the world.
  To the House, you have been insisting on border security as part of 
any package to help other countries. I get it. I get it. I get it. You 
are right to do that, but stop sending H.R. 2. You aren't solving the 
problem by passing a bill that can't go anywhere. H.R. 2, no matter how 
much you like it--I particularly, actually, do like it--didn't pick up 
one Democratic vote in the House, and you lost two Republicans. We have 
put it on the floor of the Senate. We lost one Republican and didn't 
pick up one Democrat. It is not going to become a law. So it doesn't 
matter if it can't be enacted. I want to secure our border, but with 
H.R. 2, the votes are not here for it.
  To my House colleagues, if you can't pick up one Democrat, how are we 
supposed to pick up 11? And, when we voted on H.R. 2, we lost one 
Republican. So I would advise you to find some alternative to H.R. 2 
that would really help. There are a bunch of them.

[[Page S852]]

Marsha Blackburn has, like, 12 ideas, and I have got three. Let's try 
to find some border security measures, and let's do this.
  There are some people rightly upset that we are giving nonlethal aid 
to Ukraine after all this money. Why don't we just focus on the weapons 
and let our European allies help them financially? I don't mind helping 
them financially some, but our friends in the House probably are going 
to take a different view.

  I talked to President Trump today, and he is dead set against this 
package. He thinks that we should make packages like this a loan, not a 
gift. It is what we did with Lend-Lease for the British.
  In 2003, I had an amendment with Senators Collins, Kay Bailey 
Hutchison, and a couple others to make the reconstruction of Iraq--of 
Iraq--in 2003, a loan, not a grant. Pay us back when you can. Get back 
on your feet, get your oil industry up and running, and try to pay us 
back, within reason, as much as you can. That was defeated by a single 
vote.
  Here is where I think the American people are at: very much 
supportive of Israel; very much understanding, I think, of the 
consequences of failure in Ukraine.
  There is an element in my caucus that wants to pull the plug on 
Ukraine. These are pretty much many of the same people who wanted to 
pull the plug on Afghanistan.
  My friend, Rand Paul--I don't know where his statement is--but he has 
been consistent. You have got to give him that. He wanted to pull out 
of everywhere. He still does. I would just tell him: You may be tired 
of fighting a radical Islam; they are not tired of fighting. You may 
want to become fortress America, but it won't work. Senator Paul, our 
border is our last line of defense, not our first line of defense. So 
when you pull out of Afghanistan, after the passage of time, and expect 
it all to turn out well, you miss what happened in 2011 in Iraq.
  The reason I keep saying this is that wanting a war to be over is not 
enough. The other side has to want it to be over too.
  Here is where we find ourselves in 2024: Radical Islam is getting 
stronger as I speak. They are back in charge of Afghanistan.
  Here is what I have come to learn since September 11, 2001, to this 
very minute: The enemy we are facing are religious fanatics.
  Hitler wanted to kill all the Jews and create a master race. He wrote 
a book, and nobody believed him. They should have.
  These people are on a mission to purify Islam, to destroy the State 
of Israel, and come after us. You can want them to stop. They will not 
stop unless you make them.
  Here is what I would suggest to this body and the American people: 
All this time has passed, but the enemy is still there.
  Here is the good news: There are plenty of people over there who 
don't want what these guys are selling, and they are willing to fight 
with us. Be their partner.
  It breaks my heart to pull the plug on all the people who stepped 
forward in Afghanistan. Only God knows what kind of life they are 
leading right now.
  If you show weakness in one place, it hurts you everywhere else. 
Putin chose to invade in 2022, I think, because he saw us weak in 2021.
  As to what we should do next, we should never count on a foreign 
country to protect American shores. We are going to need some level of 
troop presence--it doesn't have to be 100,000, by any means--working 
with populations over there fighting radical Islam so they won't hit us 
here. If you haven't learned that by now, you have missed a lot. How 
many more times do we have to do the same thing to realize it is not 
working?
  My fear is that the mistakes we have made have caught up to us big 
time. And when you take a broken border and put it into the mix of what 
has been going on for the last 23 years with a radical Islam, it is a 
lethal cocktail to make 9/11 occur again on steroids.
  As I speak this evening, Israel is in a fight for its literal life. 
The Ayatollah is engaging America and other allies through proxies, 
trying to drive us out of the Mideast. If you think the Ayatollah wants 
a peaceful nuclear program, you should not be allowed to drive. He 
wants a bomb. And if he ever got the bomb, he would use it.
  The first thing you have got to understand is who is on the other 
side of the table. The ``Rocket Man'' in North Korea, he has got 
nuclear weapons. I think he is a mafia state. I don't want him to have 
any more, but I don't believe he is going to wake up one day and attack 
us if we are strong.
  China wants to dominate the world in a kind of nonlethal way, a 
combination of force and cheating behavior in the economy. So we have 
got to deal with China.
  Russia wants to reconstruct the old Russian Empire, the old Soviet 
Union. And if you let Putin get away with it in Ukraine, he ain't going 
to stop, and you are going to have a war with NATO. That is why I want 
to help Ukraine.
  But having said all of that, for me to be able to convince people in 
South Carolina to continue to support conflicts overseas, I have to 
prove to them that I get it when they tell me: What about our own 
country?
  So I am not going to Munich. I am going to the southern border. I am 
not going to vote for this aid package because I think this body did 
not seriously entertain trying to strengthen our border.
  The bill is going nowhere in the House. I am going to try to convince 
some of my colleagues in the House: Listen to President Trump. Make 
some of this a loan. It is called the Trump rule, I think. We are 
willing to help you, but pay us back if you can. I think most Americans 
would appreciate that change of attitude. Put together something on the 
new package that is more lethal--lethal aid--minus humanitarian aid, 
with a loan, not a grant, and some reasonable border security 
provisions.

  I think we can do two things. I think we can help our friends, and I 
think we can help ourselves. It will be a more sustainable position for 
political leaders to take when the American people understand that 
others, if they can pay you back, they should.
  I really believe in helping my neighbor when the barn burns down, but 
if they can pay me back down the road, great.
  The bottom line: I thought about this for days. I have been one of 
the leading voices on our side: You can't pull the plug on Ukraine; we 
have got to help Israel.
  I am always in a tug-of-war with President Trump. He did not pull all 
of our forces out in Afghanistan, I appreciate that. ``America First,'' 
to me, works. Isolationism doesn't.
  I know this bill is going nowhere in the House.
  To my House colleagues: I am voting no against aid that I believe is 
very much needed--and I have been an advocate for it--to let you know I 
am listening to you. I am letting my colleagues in my conference know 
it is time to sort of have other people do more if they can. I am with 
you. Let's make it a loan, not a grant. Let's make it more lethal. 
Let's do something on the border that will actually pass. Then we can 
end this debacle in a pretty good spot.
  I will close with this. In a few minutes, the Super Bowl is going to 
kick off. I, like most everybody--most people in the country--am going 
to watch the ball game. I have been to Iraq and Afghanistan more times 
than I can count--52 is the last time, but more since--usually with 
Senator McCain. I have seen the wars go up and go down. I have seen 
surges. I have seen mistakes. I have made my own fair share of 
mistakes. But I cannot tell you how worried I am as an American right 
now that we have lost our vision when it comes to defending America.
  In 2024, my friend, we have the most porous border I have known since 
I have been in public service. Fentanyl is coming over killing 
thousands of Americans. Nine million people have come across. The 
numbers on the Terrorist Watchlist grow daily.
  Hamas has generated a jihad. Our help of Israel is going to make an 
attack on America more likely, with jihadists to pay us back.
  Putin, if he gets away with it, will set in motion the invasion of 
Taiwan by the Chinese.
  So why don't we do this? Why don't we find a way to help our friends 
in Ukraine that will be politically more sustainable? Why don't we 
build a bigger Navy so China will be less likely to

[[Page S853]]

invade Taiwan? Why don't we stick with our friends in Israel as long as 
it takes and quit trying to tell them what is the proper response after 
this carnage?
  I do want Israel to try to lessen civilian casualties. But to our 
friends in Israel: I know why this is so hard. Hamas makes it that way.
  We have got a chance here in the next 30 days or less to come up with 
a solution to our border and help our allies in a way that the American 
people will be more supportive of. I think it is now time for us, as a 
nation, to look to others in the world and say: Do more where you can.
  To our friends in NATO: Trump is right; you should pay more.
  To our friends in Ukraine: We want to be there for you, but we are 
$34 trillion in debt. Let's make it a loan. Pay us back when you can, 
if you can, and come up with a sustainable way of doing business, given 
a nation so in debt.
  And before we do any of that, convince the American people we have 
the ability and the desire to protect our own backyard.
  ``America First,'' to me, means that America leads from the front, 
not from behind; that America shapes history. It is not overwhelmed by 
it. But America has to insist on others doing their part.
  I would say this. There is more others could do, and they should. 
Europe has been pretty good, quite frankly, on Ukraine. There is more 
others could do, and they should.
  We should go back to trying to secure our border. The House has sent 
a bill that had no chance of passing. The Senate took up a bipartisan 
bill in a way that could really not be debated. So both bodies, for 
different reasons, have got us in a spot where we are not going to do 
anything meaningful on the border. So I won't be going to Munich; I 
will be going to the border.
  To the people in Munich who wonder why I am going to the border: If 
you want me to help you, I have got to convince people back home I have 
helped them.
  And I ain't going back to Munich any time soon until we fix our own 
border.
  I will gladly vote yes on this package when it is rearranged.
  The House will take up this bill that will pass, and it is going to 
get stuck. So I am going to try to unstick it, if I can. I am going to 
urge the House to listen to the Trump rule. See if we can pay for some 
of this--not pay for it, make it a loan; pay for it if you can--and get 
this right before it is too late.
  All these years after 9/11, I am absolutely dumbfounded, as a nation, 
how we could be where we are today, and I am going to do my part to try 
to fix it--a stronger military budget, not a weaker one; fix the 
border; help others, but insist they help themselves.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, Abraham Lincoln, when he opened up the 
Gettysburg Address, said: Few will little note, nor long remember what 
I say here today.
  As I rise as the Super Bowl is about to begin, I realize that most 
people are looking for a view of Taylor Swift and not listening to us. 
But nonetheless, I feel compelled to come because we are obviously 
considering important issues.
  As we know, we are currently discussing a national security bill that 
would assist Israel after the October 7 attack and resist the efforts 
of Putin and the Chinese Communist Party. But this issue, importantly, 
has become entwined with border security, U.S. border security.
  The way things work--and we all know this in the Chamber but just to 
specify--if any bill is going to be signed into law, it is because you 
have good policy, you have good politics, and it has good process. If 
you don't have those three things on a big bill, then something is not 
going through.
  I would like to talk about that policy, politics, process dynamic 
here and how the process is being used to defeat the passage of good 
policy. By the way, it is that process which confuses folks, but I will 
get to that. Let me just first discuss a little bit of the policy.
  I am speaking as a Republican, a conservative Republican, and I can 
say that almost all Republicans want to confront the Chinese Communist 
Party. We understand around the world that the Chinese Communist Party 
is doing its best to undermine the interest of the United States, 
turning a blind eye as fentanyl is imported into our country, with 
60,000 to 100,000 people in any given year dying from overdoses. We 
understand that the Chinese Communist Party takes our industry, 
subsidizes theirs with that industry that moves over there, and they 
take our jobs. Then they pollute the atmosphere, and it blows over to 
the United States. This is a geopolitical rival, and the Chinese 
Communist Party has turned their eyes upon Taiwan.
  Most Republicans--all Republicans--want to confront China--or so they 
say. Most Republicans want to keep Vladimir Putin from killing 
Americans. We understand he is trying to kill Americans. If anybody 
watching now or later wants to dispute that fact, just Google ``Wagner 
Group''--Wagner Group, that group of Russians, that military group 
attacking U.S. soldiers in the Middle East. You go there, you are going 
to find an article. You can find a radio transcript of them attacking 
our troops. We slaughtered them. That is not the point. They intended 
to slaughter us. Russian troops attacked Americans. Russians are in 
Venezuela. In Venezuela, they have helped that become a narco-state in 
which drugs are being imported to the United States. And Russian troops 
are trying to hurt us around the world. Most Republicans, if not all, 
say they are against that.
  Lastly, let's talk briefly about support of Israel. Republicans 
support Israel, and after October 7, in which, unprovoked, Hamas went 
in with those atrocities--killing pregnant women, slaughtering infants, 
killing the elderly; not going after combatants, not going after the 
Israeli Defense Forces, but going after Israelis at a peace concert, at 
a kibbutz where a group of Israelis lived who are committed to 
reconciliation with Palestine. That kibbutz was specifically targeted.
  Republicans say: We support Israel. In fact, it is hard for a 
Republican not to support the three things I just listed.
  So we have a policy before us which accomplishes that. It is not 
perfect. No bill comes through here that is perfect. Anybody can come 
up here with a laundry list on any bill and you can cherry-pick and 
find something that is bad with it. That is just the biggest game in 
town around here. But the point is that it overall accomplishes the 
goals we wish to accomplish if you want to keep Russians from killing 
Americans, push back on the CCP, and support our ally Israel.
  Now, can we do more? Absolutely. There is a mess at the southern 
border. One of my colleagues, Lindsey Graham, spoke earlier about a 
hole in the fence that the United States doesn't fix, the Biden 
administration doesn't fix, and ``60 Minutes'' had a documentary of 
them just pouring through this 4-foot-wide hole.
  So we know there is a mess at the southern border. Wouldn't it be 
great if we could put an amendment on this good policy to support our 
allies that will likewise control the southern border?
  The politics of controlling the border are really good. Republicans 
want to control the southern border. The politics to support Israel by 
and large are good on the Republican side.
  But the politics maybe are not as good, and there are some who, 
frankly, are not sure they want to support Israel, they don't think 
they really want to combat Putin, and they are not sure they want to 
support Taiwan, but they don't really want to say that. So instead, 
they say: Well, there is nothing in there about the southern border, 
and so I am not going to support this particular legislation.
  That makes the politics work out.
  I am being principled, by golly. It doesn't support the southern 
border. It doesn't stop those illegals coming across. So therefore, I 
am going to tank the whole bill.
  That politics kind of works for them.
  So our policy is good on supporting our allies. We would like to have 
better

[[Page S854]]

policy to support the southern border. But the politics of not 
supporting our allies are lousy, so if you don't want to support our 
allies, you just say that you don't have anything about the southern 
border, and so therefore, you are not going to support our allies.
  It is getting a little confusing. I apologize. But the people who are 
trying to execute this are relying on that confusion.
  How would you go about doing this? If you don't want the bad politics 
of not supporting Israel and you would like to have better policy--but 
wait a second. If you get the better policy, then you have to support 
Israel and confront Ukraine and China. You use the process.
  Remember, we have to have policy, politics, and process. This is 
where the use of process comes in to give you cover on the politics as 
you work to defeat good policy.
  Now, again, all those folks back home, reaching for the Doritos, 
looking for Taylor Swift on TV or getting tired of seeing Taylor Swift 
on TV, are saying: Process. Process. What is process?
  Well, anyone who has gone to a PTA meeting, a school board meeting, 
any sort of meeting has seen process at work. There is an agenda. If 
you want to be heard, you raise your hand, maybe get on a list. No one 
person or one group is allowed to dominate theoretically, but all get 
to contribute. In that mutual contribution, you come up with a product 
that is actually better for the whole. That is the way process is 
supposed to work. It works whether you are at a PTA meeting, a school 
board meeting, or in the U.S. Senate.
  But that process can be misused. Frankly, anyone who has been to a 
PTA meeting kind of knows it can be misused. So how could the process 
be misused in this set of circumstances? Well, remember, the only way 
we make this bill better is if we are allowed to put in an amendment 
that controls the situation at the southern border. But if you use the 
process to prevent an amendment from being placed, you never get that 
amendment; you never improve the policy; you never allow something good 
to happen to control the influx of illegal immigrants across the 
southern border. And because you never get that amendment, your excuse 
of voting against the policy to support Israel, confronting Putin, and 
the CCP is airtight--because somehow it doesn't address the problem at 
the southern border. But wait a second. You can only do that with an 
amendment, and the process is being used to prevent that amendment from 
being placed.
  Now, if it seems like things are going back and forth, that is kind 
of the intent. How do we confuse the American people? How do I keep my 
politics straight? Because I want my politics to support my allies, but 
I really don't want to support them. I don't want to say that verbally, 
that I don't want to support them, I don't want to confront Putin. The 
way I can do it is prevent an amendment, but I can't say that I am 
preventing an amendment, so I have to use the process to prevent the 
amendment.
  My children and I used to play a game called Opposite Day. They were 
young. At some point, they got too old for the game.
  They would say something like: Daddy, I want ice cream.
  I would say: Well, today is Opposite Day. You don't get ice cream if 
you want it.
  Well, I don't want ice cream.
  Well, Opposite Day is off. You get ice cream after all.
  You know, it would be kind of this going back and forth before I 
would finally buy them the ice cream.
  It is kind of like what is happening here. People are saying they 
don't want something or saying they want something when all their 
actions show they don't. The actions are opposite of that which they 
hope to achieve, but indeed, they are achieving what they actually 
want.
  But that is kind of--I won't go any further with opposite day. It is 
using the process to prevent an amendment from being placed because 
placing the amendment would therefore remove the obstacle to passing 
the policy which they really are opposed to.
  So let's quickly review. If you don't want to support Israel, if you 
don't want to confront Putin, if you don't want to confront the Chinese 
Communist Party and you would rather block this bill from supporting 
them by saying there is nothing to control the southern border, but you 
prevent an amendment from being passed that would control the southern 
border, then your politics are straight.
  Am I frustrated? I am incredibly frustrated. I am frustrated because 
I feel like this is a fundamental dishonesty with the American people.
  By the way, I am for the policy of controlling the southern border. 
There are drugs and people coming across that border, and I want an 
amendment process whereby we can make it tougher and harder for those 
cartels to ship those folks. Give us an ability to have that amendment. 
But I also want to support Israel, confront Putin, and I also want to 
keep the CCP from taking Taiwan for many reasons I could go into.
  By the way, I may be wrong. I may be totally wrong; in which case, I 
will owe an apology to some folks. But if all of a sudden it breaks up 
and we can have an amendment--an amendment that maybe makes it just a 
little harder for a cartel to traffic people and to traffic drugs--I 
will be so pleased. I will be so pleased that I was wrong.
  But on this day when folks are hopefully thinking about the Super 
Bowl and more pleasant things, I can't help but say that we in the 
Senate owe it to the American people to both be honest to them and to 
get something done.
  This is my plea to my colleagues: Let's be honest, and let's get 
something done.
  I yield the floor.

Bring this war to 
an end. Stop the killing and bloodshed. When Joe Biden took office, he 
went to the State Department and claimed ``Diplomacy is back.'' That 
turned out to be a lie. We have yet to see a diplomatic effort from 
this administration. Joe Biden's idea of diplomacy is sending Anthony 
Blinken to Israel to tell Israel to slow down the war in Gaza. That is 
not diplomacy. We need some real diplomacy in Ukraine
;There was also an amendment that I tried to make pending that would 
clarify that, not only would our American taxpayer dollars stop funding 
UNRWA--UNRWA is this singularly offensive, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel 
agency within the U.N., and, I am, here again, grateful to those who 
crafted the bill that at least UNRWA was excluded from U.S. funding 
because UNRWA, as we have discovered in recent weeks and as many of us 
have worried about for years, has been involved in all kinds of 
horrible things, not just the indoctrination of young children in Gaza 
such that they were taught in UNRWA-run schools to hate Jewish people, 
but it has also encouraged them to engage in acts of violence against 
them, and they have been for years--in fact, for the better part of a 
couple of decades. More recently, it appears that a number of UNRWA 
personnel and facilities and other resources were used actively to help 
these attacks and those responsible for the attacks.
; We know that October 7--absolutely grisly. It was a sobering wake-up 
call to all who have witnessed it. And for those of us who have visited 
those areas in Israel, in southern Israel next to Gaza--as my wife and 
I have in recent weeks--it is sobering, heartbreaking, breathtaking. 
There are not enough adjectives associated with misery and shock and 
horror to describe the atrocities that were carried out that awful day 
on October 7. Yet October 7 is--and was--the tip of the iceberg 
compared to what they have planned.
;You add insult to injury to that, after making them work that long to 
make the money, after then taxing them again because you spent too much 
money, you make it so that their money doesn't spend as far, doesn't 
buy as much as it used to, you add insult to injury by not even 
debating an amendment to make sure that their hard-earned tax dollars 
aren't used to kill Israelis and threaten, intimidate, perhaps kill 
Americans and our allies. This is really concerning. I don't understand 
why we would want to do this.
; So that text finally dropped on Sunday of last week. I believe on 
February 4 that legislation dropped, a 370-page piece of legislation 
that would commit many, many billions of dollars to Ukraine, a few 
billion dollars to East Asia, a few billion dollars to Israel, and a 
few billion dollars, combined with some policy changes, to the American 
southern border.
; Are we concerned about Israel? You better believe we are. We know 
that they are in a fight for survival. We also know that Iran is who is 
funding Hamas.
;I think from the get-go--by the way, my position on this has been, I 
think, consistent. You could roll the tape from when I was on this 
floor talking about it. I think these issues should be spread out 
separately. I don't think Ukraine money should be tied to Israel money 
should be tied to Taiwan money. I think it is a mistake. Again, I think 
it robs the ability of individual Senators to say: You know, that 
situation is different.
  Take the difference between Ukraine money and Israel money. There are 
different levels of support in this place. There are different 
likelihoods of success. There are different needs. There are different 
coalitions of allies around the world that can step up or haven't 
stepped up. But to continually come back to the American people without 
an articulated plan here or what victory looks like as it relates to 
Ukraine, you are denying the reality of the justified skepticism.
;I had an amendment to separate out aid for Israel. We are not going 
to get to vote on that.
  By the way, I don't think it necessarily changes the result too much 
on the floor if you separated out Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan. I 
don't think that it does. But it does certainly harm, again, people's 
trust and their faith in the process.
;Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, earlier this week, I came to the 
floor to discuss the horrific terrorist attacks committed by Hamas 
against Israel on October 7, the brutal murder of about 1,200 people 
and the seizure of 240 hostages. I underscored the fact that Israel not 
only has the right but it has the duty to defend itself against those 
heinous acts and prevent any future October 7s. Never again. I also 
repeated my calls to prioritize the release of hostages, including 
American citizens. I also pointed out that while Israel is conducting a 
just war, it must be waged justly, including taking all necessary 
measures to protect innocent civilians.
  Last week, Secretary of State Blinken made his fifth trip to Israel, 
where this time he urged Prime Minister Netanyahu not to launch a major 
military operation against Rafah, a city in southern Gaza whose 
population has increased fivefold since the beginning of the war 
because Palestinian refugees fleeing from northern Gaza and other parts 
of Gaza were told by the Netanyahu government that Rafah was a safe 
place for them to go.

  Within hours of meeting with Secretary Blinken, Prime Minister

[[Page S884]]

Netanyahu rebuffed that request and announced publicly that he had 
decided to launch just such an operation against Rafah. Yesterday, as 
if to rub it in, Prime Minister Netanyahu appeared on ABC Sunday 
television here in the United States to say that despite the requests 
from the United States, he had decided that Israel will launch a 
military operation against the city of Rafah.
  This is part of a pattern--a pattern where Prime Minister Netanyahu 
thanks President Biden and the United States for our substantial 
military assistance but then mostly rejects our request to take 
measures to protect civilians and to facilitate desperately needed 
humanitarian assistance to people in need.
  President Biden has called the bombings in Gaza ``indiscriminate,'' 
and the United States has repeatedly called upon the Netanyahu 
government to take steps to end the huge number of civilian deaths from 
bombing, artillery, and other weaponry. The death toll now stands at 
over 28,000 people, over two-thirds of them women and children. What 
does Prime Minister Netanyahu say? He says Israel is already doing all 
it can.
  President Biden recently called Israel's actions in Gaza ``over the 
top.'' Prime Minister Netanyahu said he didn't know what President 
Biden was talking about.
  Every major international aid organization I have spoken to--and I 
have spoken to virtually every one--says that the humanitarian crisis 
in Gaza is the worst they have seen in the world, ever, in their 
decades of experience, as over 400,000 people are on the verge of 
starvation, and the entire population of over 2 million is at crisis 
levels of food insecurity. Meanwhile, Israeli authorities in Gaza, 
COGAT, say, ``There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza.''
  The Biden administration has repeatedly urged the Netanyahu 
government to allow for more humanitarian assistance into Gaza, only to 
be mostly ignored. The overriding message to the United States from the 
Netanyahu coalition is this: Thanks for giving us all the weapons. 
Thanks for your taxpayers' support. But don't lecture us about civilian 
casualties or the need to better facilitate the delivery of 
humanitarian assistance.
  For example, on his trip to Israel last week, Secretary Blinken 
pointed out that ``Israelis were dehumanized in the most horrific way 
on October 7th, and that the hostages have been dehumanized every day 
since.'' I agree. Secretary Blinken then went on to say ``but that 
cannot be a license to dehumanize others.''
  A former Ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, responded by 
essentially saying: Thank you, Secretary Blinken, for the ammunition, 
but don't accuse Israel of dehumanization because that delegitimizes 
Israel and makes it harder for us to use that ammunition or to defend 
ourselves and exercise our right to self-defense.
  In other words, former Ambassador Oren was saying: Keep sending us 
the weapons, but don't suggest that we are dehumanizing innocent 
Palestinians.
  I would suggest that rather than criticizing Secretary Blinken for 
his comments, Michael Oren and others should condemn the dehumanizing 
statements about Palestinians that have been made by members of the 
Netanyahu coalition and other Israeli Government officials during the 
war in Gaza. Here are just some of them:
  One said: ``There is no such thing as innocence in Gaza.''
  Another Minister described the campaign in Gaza as ``rolling out the 
Gaza nakba. Gaza nakba 2023,'' nakba being a reference to the mass 
displacement of Palestinians back in 1948. And that statement was 
echoed by other members of Netanyahu's Likud Party.
  Another member of Likud said: ``There is no place for any 
humanitarian gestures--we must erase the memory of Amalek,'' referring 
to members of a biblical tribe that was an enemy of Israel--in fact, 
such an enemy that Scripture said the Israelites should put to death 
every man, woman, and child.
  Indeed Prime Minister Netanyahu himself said: ``You must remember 
what Amalek has done to you,'' a reference, scholars say, that has long 
been used by the Israeli far right to justify the inhumane treatment of 
Palestinians.
  Even President Herzog, considered by many to be a more moderate 
voice, painted all Palestinians with a broad brush, saying: ``It's an 
entire nation out there that is responsible. It's not true this 
rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, it's absolutely not 
true.'' President Herzog.
  These are just a sampling of the many statements made by government 
officials and Netanyahu coalition members.
  So what should the United States do? What should we do when bombs and 
artillery that we have provided and paid for are being used to kill 
large numbers of innocent Palestinian civilians and we are told to go 
mind our own business? What should the United States do when over 2 
million Palestinian civilians, who have nothing to do with Hamas, are 
facing a humanitarian catastrophe, but the Netanyahu government refuses 
to open the Eretz crossing or take the other measures that 25 Senators 
wrote to President Biden about last week, asking him to push the 
Netanyahu government to do them? What should the United States do when 
the Netanyahu government refuses to prioritize the release of all the 
remaining hostages, including American citizens?

  What should we do when extremist settlers in the West Bank, in many 
cases with the IDF standing by and in some cases with their active 
participation, attack Palestinians with impunity and push them off 
their land? What should we do?
  What should we do when we have made clear that the United States 
opposes the launch of a new military operation in the city of Rafah 
because it will turn into an even bigger humanitarian disaster, but 
Prime Minister Netanyahu goes on American national TV to say he is 
going to do it anyway?
  Rafah is a city in southern Gaza. Before the war started, it was a 
city with a population of about 300,000 people. Its population has now 
multiplied in size by 5 times. About 1.3 million people are there now, 
over 1 million of them having fled death and destruction in other parts 
of Gaza because they were told by Prime Minister Netanyahu and others 
that they would be safe there.
  I visited the Egyptian side of the Rafah gate about 5 weeks ago, 
along with my colleague Senator Merkley, to better understand the 
humanitarian situation in Gaza. We talked to people. We listened to 
people. We got fully briefed. The humanitarian situation was a 
catastrophe then, and, by all accounts, the situation in Gaza has gone 
from nightmare to pure hell, even more so in the north than in the 
south.
  When asked on national television on Sunday where all of these 
civilians now seeking refuge would go, Prime Minister Netanyahu 
breezily stated:

       You know, the areas that we've cleared north of Rafah, 
     plenty of areas there.

  That is what the Prime Minister said on American TV. Now, unless he 
is talking about areas that were cleared through bombing and have been 
reduced to rubble, it is simply not true.
  Don't believe those who claim that there is an easy path to caring 
for the 1.3 million people in Rafah. It wasn't that long ago that Prime 
Minister Netanyahu claimed that there was no humanitarian crisis in 
Gaza--no humanitarian crisis there. In fact, he boasted that he was 
allowing into Gaza the minimal amount of humanitarian aid to avoid a 
humanitarian disaster. Well, the claim that there is no humanitarian 
disaster doesn't pass any credible test, and we know that.
  For weeks, the United Nations and international aid organizations 
have warned that Palestinian civilians are on the verge of starvation. 
Those warnings have been ignored and dismissed by Prime Minister 
Netanyahu and his extremist government.
  Just recently, the World Food Programme, together with UNICEF, which 
is the U.N. organization to look after the well-being of children 
around the world--both of these organizations, by the way, currently 
headed by Americans--they, WFP and UNICEF, issued an analysis recently 
on the deterioration of the nutrition situation in Gaza during the 
first 120 days of the war. Here are some of the things that they 
concluded: In northern Gaza, more than 90 percent of children age 6 to 
23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls faced severe 
food poverty. The food they do have is of the lowest nutritional value. 
More than 90 percent of children age 6 to 23 months

[[Page S885]]

and more than 95 percent of pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls 
are eating two or fewer food groups. And 95 percent of households are 
limiting meals and portion sizes; 64 percent are only eating one meal a 
day.
  They indicated that health screenings show a rapid deterioration of 
the nutrition situation for children age 6 to 23 months in northern 
Gaza, with global acute malnutrition at over 15 percent.
  WHO, the World Health Organization, classifies global acute 
malnutrition over 15 percent as a critical emergency.
  Yesterday, I began to hear reports of people who have actually 
starved to death in Gaza. So, earlier today, I asked the head of the 
World Food Programme, former American Ambassador Cindy McCain, about 
these reports. I sent her a note--a text message--asking about reports 
that some children have now crossed the awful threshold from being on 
the verge of starvation to dying of starvation.
  She wrote back:

       This is true. We are unable to get in enough food to keep 
     people from the brink. Famine is imminent. I wish I had 
     better news.

  I want that to sink in. Kids in Gaza are now dying from the 
deliberate withholding of food. In addition to the horror of that news, 
one other thing is true: That is a war crime. It is a textbook war 
crime, and that makes those who orchestrate it war criminals.
  So now the question is: What will the United States do? What will we 
do? What will President Biden do?
  President Biden must take action in response to what is happening. 
First and foremost, the President must demand that the Netanyahu 
government immediately allow more food and water and other lifesaving 
supplies into Gaza and make sure it reaches the children and other 
people who are starving, including in the north.
  A few weeks ago, 25 Senators wrote the President a letter outlining 
some of those steps. To my knowledge, none of those five steps have 
been implemented by the Netanyahu government.
  Second, unless and until the Netanyahu government allows more relief 
into Gaza, President Biden needs to invoke section 620I of the Foreign 
Assistance Act. Here is the exact language of that section of the 
Foreign Assistance Act:

       No assistance shall be furnished under this chapter of the 
     Arms Export Control Act to any country when it is made known 
     to the President that the government of such country 
     prohibits or otherwise restricts, directly or indirectly, the 
     transport or delivery of United States humanitarian 
     assistance.

  Now, about 3 weeks ago, I asked senior State Department officials to 
tell me why this law--section 620I, Foreign Assistance Act--has not 
been applied. Tell me how it is not the case that Prime Minister 
Netanyahu is not restricting, directly or indirectly, the transport or 
delivery of United States humanitarian assistance, when we have the 
humanitarian horror show that I just mentioned.
  Well, I haven't gotten an answer to the question I posed about 3 
weeks ago. And the answer is: There is no good answer to that question.
  Now I applaud the President of the United States for issuing National 
Security Memorandum No. 20 a few days ago. National Security Memorandum 
No. 20, which now has full legal force, is based on an amendment that I 
and 18 of my fellow Senators filed on this national security bill that 
we are considering right now, and I want to thank the President and his 
team for putting the terms of that amendment into action, into law, 
through the national security memorandum, which gives the President of 
the United States additional tools to require that countries--all 
countries--that receive and use our military assistance do so in 
accordance with international humanitarian law. In fact, here is the 
wording of the national security memorandum, which is now the law of 
the land.

       The Secretary of State shall . . . obtain credible and 
     reliable written assurances from a representative of the 
     recipient country as the Secretary of State deems appropriate 
     that, in any area of armed conflict where such recipient 
     country uses such defense articles, consistent with 
     applicable law, the recipient country will facilitate and not 
     arbitrarily deny, restrict, or otherwise impede, directly or 
     indirectly, the transport or delivery of United States 
     humanitarian assistance and United States Government 
     supported international efforts to provide humanitarian 
     assistance.

  That is now the law of the land.
  The bill before us does a number of things. It provides military 
assistance to Ukraine, to Israel, and to our partners in the Indo-
Pacific. It also contains lifesaving humanitarian aid that, if it can 
actually be delivered to those who need it, would save lives in Gaza, 
the West Bank, Sudan, and other places around the world facing 
desperate humanitarian situations.
  As I have said before on this floor, I am supporting this bill 
because of the vital military assistance it provides to the people of 
Ukraine, and I will vote for it because, without that assistance, they 
will not be able to sustain their courageous effort to fight off the 
onslaught against their democracy and their sovereignty from Vladimir 
Putin. And I support the vital humanitarian assistance in this bill, 
and I fully support the funds to supply Israel with the Iron Dome 
system and other defensive systems that have been essential to protect 
the people of Israel from Hamas rocket attacks and are there to protect 
them from other incoming missiles.
  With respect to the lethal, offensive portion of that assistance, I 
am asking President Biden to make sure that it is provided in strict 
adherence to National Security Memorandum 20 that he just issued and be 
used only in accordance with international humanitarian law. That 
memorandum provides the President with substantial new leverage to make 
that happen, if he chooses to use it.
  I hope he will because the U.S. Government has an obligation on 
behalf of the American people to make sure that our military support 
aligns with our values and interests. There should be no blank checks 
for any country.
  We cannot continue the pattern where Prime Minister Netanyahu says, 
``Thank you, Mr. President, for America's generous military 
assistance,'' and then thumbs his nose at America's legitimate 
requests.
  This is a huge moment in history with what is going on right now in 
Ukraine, but it is also a critical question for our country with 
respect to what is going on in Gaza. And I hope and I pray that the 
President of the United States will make sure that the United States 
conducts itself in a manner that is consistent with our values and with 
our interests.

  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Butler). The Senator from Florida.
  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam President, some of my Democratic 
colleagues, unfortunately, will want you to believe that any opposition 
to their agenda is evil and unjustified. They have claimed for weeks 
that mere questions about the $95 billion bill that the Senate is now 
considering are rooted in some radical rightwing anti-democracy 
conspiracy, and the liberal press prints these lies as gospel. I think 
this process has destroyed the Senate and ignores the history of our 
great Nation.
  One of the first decisions facing our new Republic was whether to 
engage in the conflict raging between French Revolutionaries and an 
alliance of European nations led by Great Britain.
  As we know, President George Washington ultimately decided to remain 
neutral in that conflict, knowing that our new Nation was not prepared 
to assume the grand responsibilities of supporting a cause, no matter 
how noble, while properly attending to the pressing matters facing his 
new government here at home.
  America was cash-strapped and war weary.
  In the centuries that have passed since that moment, our great Nation 
has evolved. The United States has grown to be the leader of the free 
world--the true global superpower--representing the ideals of liberty, 
freedom and democracy, and standing staunchly against oppression and 
tyranny wherever it is found.
  We no longer must wrestle with these decisions in the ways our 
Founders did, but we still face tremendous domestic challenges that I 
am sure Washington, Hamilton, and Jefferson could never have imagined 
in April of 1793.
  Today, we are once again cash-strapped and war weary. Like never 
before, Americans are questioning whether their Federal Government has 
lost its way and now fails to represent the people they elected. Less 
than 25 percent of the country believes we are on the right track.

[[Page S886]]

  Decades of politicians in Washington being addicted to earmarks and 
pushing reckless fiscal policy have decimated the financial health of 
our great nation. The United States has more than $34 trillion in 
debt--soon to exceed $35 trillion--and a budget deficit projected this 
year of nearly $1.8 trillion.
  Since 2019, the U.S. population has increased just 1.8 percent, but 
our Federal budget is set to increase by 55 percent. Federal revenues 
were down over 9 percent last year. In the last 3 months, we have lost 
nearly 1.6 million full-time jobs. Part-time jobs are up more than 
850,000 as more Americans can't find full-time work and have to work 
multiple jobs to make ends meet.
  Biden's bad economy and reckless policies have created massive 
inflation. It is up 17 percent since he took office. It is causing 
immense pain for families every day, especially our poor families like 
mine growing up.
  Unfortunately, the world's evil regimes and tyrants do not wait for 
the United States to be in top fighting and fiscal shape to launch 
their attacks. And the weakness and appeasement of the Biden 
administration has emboldened them to sow chaos in every corner of the 
world.
  Iran and its proxies, like Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah, are 
waging war against Israel, fighting to destroy the Jewish State and its 
people. Russia continues its war in Ukraine, creating instability not 
seen in Europe since World War II. And Communist China continues to 
threaten the United States and prepare for an invasion of Taiwan that 
will upend world trade and destabilize the Indo-Pacific even further.
  While chaos continues abroad, America's national security is also 
being threatened every day by invasion of single adult males at our own 
borders--one that President Biden's lawless actions have created and 
encouraged and maintained.
  This is the sad reality for our Nation under the weak leadership of 
Joe Biden. It has forced this body to deal with world events in a way 
that I am sure many of us completely dislike.
  I say all of this to put the moment we find ourselves in today into 
the honest context that it deserves but that is so often ignored or 
purposely manipulated by Democrats and their allies in the mainstream 
media. The United States cannot ignore the massive threats we face to 
our national security and prosperity that I have just outlined. On 
that, I hope that we can all agree.
  But as this body so often does, especially under the control of our 
Democratic colleagues, the Senate is about to again fail to meet this 
moment with responsible and appropriate legislation.
  Rather than negotiating a bill for border security in the public, we 
are kept in dark for months and, ultimately, failed to negotiate a 
border security deal with Democrats that could actually get Republican 
support and pass because it did not require Biden to secure the border.
  This bill completely fails to deliver what most of our conference 
supported in tying the disbursement of Ukraine aid to real reductions 
of illegal immigration at the southern border. It is the only way we 
knew to make Biden do his job.
  Voters in Florida want a secure border today, inflation to cease, and 
better paying full-time jobs.
  Our conference demanded a secure border before we helped Ukraine 
secure their border only because we thought it was the only way to get 
Joe Biden to do his job and secure the southern border.
  Our conference supported tying the disbursement of Ukraine to real 
reductions of illegal immigration at our southern border.
  I remain interested in negotiating voting for a bill that secures our 
border now, stops the flow of drugs across our border, and stops more 
criminals and terrorists and human traffickers from coming into our 
communities now in a fiscal, responsible manner.
  When I was in business, I negotiated and closed a lot of deals. And I 
knew that if I could not walk away from the table, I would never get a 
good deal. I also knew that I would never get a good deal if the people 
sitting across the table from me didn't want the same outcome I did. We 
have to walk away from the table until we are negotiating with people 
who share the same goal as our conference, a secure border today.
  The result is what we have before us today--a wildly unaccountable 
foreign aid package that does absolutely nothing to secure the U.S. 
southern border and could funnel billions in borrowed money to Hamas 
terrorists and into the salaries of Ukrainian politicians.
  This bill claims to address the invasion of Ukraine while ignoring 
the invasion we face right here in the United States. This bill could 
send billions in borrowed money into Gaza, which is still dominated by 
the Iran-backed Hamas terrorists who killed 1,200 Israelis and more 
than 30 Americans and are still holding Americans hostage.
  I am unapologetically pro-Israel. I have had the honor of visiting 
Israel five times as both Florida Governor and as a U.S. Senator. What 
happened on October 7 horrified the world, and it struck me personally.
  In 2019, my wife Ann and I visited Kfar Aza, one of the kibbutz that 
was site to a complete massacre. As the early reports were coming out, 
I was really worried about the kibbutz because of its proximity to 
Gaza, about a half mile away.
  When I heard the news that it was the site of some of the most 
horrific and barbaric activities, my heart just sank. I wanted to 
vomit. We had spent an afternoon there in Kfar Aza. It was the most 
peaceful place. I kept thinking about the moms and kids who were 
playing outside and enjoying the warm summer weather. It is gut-
wrenching to think of the fate of the families we met that day.
  I spoke with Chen, the lady who led our tour of the kibbutz who, 
fortunately, was traveling outside of Israel that day and survived. I 
was able to talk with her, and she had not yet been able to go home. 
She said it was unclear if she will ever be allowed to go back to her 
home.
  I can't imagine.
  So many of us in this Chamber are so deeply connected to Israel, and 
I bet many of you have a story like mine.
  We know people in the IDF who have been called to serve. We have 
friends all over Israel who have spent days in bomb shelters as rockets 
have been launched by terrorists intent on wiping Israel and Jews off 
the face of the Earth.
  I have met with survivors and the hostage families. I have a poster 
outside my office that features the faces of the hostages being held by 
Hamas. I am not going to take it down until they are home. I have been 
clear that we cannot see a cease-fire until every Hamas terrorist is 
dead. I want every single one of them dead. These monsters beheaded--
they beheaded--children and babies. They raped girls and burned 
innocent civilians alive. They dragged innocent people through the 
streets and are now holding them as hostages in Gaza, which these 
terrorists absolutely control.
  It is unimaginable that the United States would ever consider sending 
money to a place where we know that it will be used to help terrorists 
who are holding American hostages. And that is exactly what this bill 
does.
  I have heard a lot of my Democratic colleagues talk about what is 
happening in Gaza, and your heart goes out to anybody impacted by war. 
I wish everybody would start talking more about the hostages. We still 
have American hostages.
  I want to make sure everyone understands exactly what I am saying 
here, which is the fact that every dollar that goes to Gaza directly 
benefits Hamas.
  I have spent every day since October 7 telling the stories of those 
being held hostage in Gaza by Iran-backed Hamas terrorists. I have 
pictures of the faces of the hostages, and I am not going to take it 
down.
  Unfortunately, President Biden has not done the same. I can't imagine 
why the President of the United States isn't speaking every single day 
about Americans--Americans--being held hostage by Hamas terrorists and 
what he is doing to get them out.
  The IDF just rescued two American hostages in a mission that the 
Biden administration urged them not to do.
  What has Biden done to rescue any hostages?
  Many of my colleagues will recall the name of 9-year-old Emily Hand. 
Emily and her father Thomas lived in a small kibbutz of Be'eri, which 
was ruthlessly

[[Page S887]]

targeted and destroyed by Hamas during the attacks. In the days 
following the attacks, Emily's dad was initially told that his 
daughter, who had spent the night at a friend's house just a few doors 
down, was killed.
  I am a father of two daughters and a grandfather of seven 
grandchildren. Watching this father speak about the murder of his 
daughter was heart-wrenching.
  He said to CNN at the time:

       They just said, ``We found Emily, and, she's dead,'' and I 
     went ``Yes.'' I went ``Yes,'' and smiled because that is the 
     best news of the possibilities that I knew . . . She was 
     either dead or in Gaza, and if you know anything about what 
     they do to people in Gaza, that is worse than death.

  Those are the words of Emily's father. Soon, to his relief and 
horror, Thomas learned that Emily was, in fact, alive and being held 
hostage by Hamas.
  This beautiful, innocent little girl spent 50 days as a hostage in 
Gaza.
  While I am sure that Thomas thanks God every day to have his little 
girl back in his arms again, he knows that the child he had on October 
6 is long gone. Emily will never be the same as she was before she was 
taken.
  It has been more than 120 days since the attacks, and some parents 
are still waiting for their children to come home. Little baby Kfir 
Bibas' first birthday was spent as a hostage in Gaza. His 4-year-old 
brother Ariel is also still being held hostage. I have a picture of 
Ariel on a milk carton. I have four or five milk cartons in my office--
just a beautiful little boy. Kfir and Ariel's parents have been waiting 
for more than 4 months to hold their babies again.
  Can you imagine?
  Now we have heard horrible reports that these innocent children may 
no longer be alive.
  Why is Biden giving money to Gazans who are holding American 
hostages? Why would we allow Biden to give more money to Gazans who are 
holding American hostages?
  They are holding Americans hostage. When will this stop? Why the heck 
are we allowing Biden to send more money to Gaza in this bill when we 
know that every dollar that goes to Gaza funds terrorism or Hamas?
  What are we doing to get American hostages released?
  I am not going to stop talking about this fact: Every dollar that 
goes into Gaza directly benefits Hamas. That is the undeniable truth, 
and that is why I have been fighting for years to pass my Stop Taxpayer 
Funding of Hamas Act, which prevents U.S. tax dollars from going to 
Gaza unless the Biden administration can certify that not a single cent 
will go to Hamas. Any of my colleagues that are interested in having 
money going to take care of the children in Gaza should want this bill 
to pass. They shouldn't want any money to go to Hamas. They should want 
it to go to these children.
  This isn't a solution in search of a problem--it addresses a very 
real threat of taxpayer money funding Iran-backed terrorism that seeks 
to destroy Israel.
  We cannot allow American families with a family member being held 
hostage to see their tax dollars going to the same people who are 
holding their family member hostage. We have seen reports that the 
Palestinian Authority has been paying over $300 million each and every 
year in monthly salaries to secure its prisoners and in monthly 
allowances to families of dead terrorists. The Palestinian Authority, 
who pays terrorists and their families, should not receive U.S. tax 
dollars. And this bill will allow more of that.
  That is insane.
  In 2021, President Biden's State Department said:

       . . . We are going to be working in partnership with the 
     United Nations and the Palestinian Authority to `kind of' 
     channel aid there in a manner that does its best to go to the 
     people of Gaza.

  The official went on to say:

       As we've seen in life, as we all know in life, there are no 
     guarantees, but we're going to do everything that we can to 
     ensure that this assistance reaches the people who need it 
     the most.

  The Biden administration thinks that the risk of resources going to 
Hamas terrorists is OK because ``in life, there are no guarantees.'' I 
completely reject that. I will not leave anything to chance when it 
comes to preventing U.S. taxpayer money from being sent to the brutal 
terrorists who have slaughtered so many Israelis and Americans.
  That is why I wasn't surprised in August 2021 when the Senate voted 
99 to 0 for my amendment to a budget bill that would have made the Stop 
Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act the law of the land. But, as we would 
learn soon after this vote, the Democrats only voted for it because 
they knew that, in the final text of the bill, written by Democrats, my 
language would be mysteriously missing. I have tried twice more since 
then to pass this legislation in the Senate, and the Democrats have 
blocked it twice.
  I know that the left has a big problem on its hands as so many 
Democrats rally for Hamas and against Israel in the streets of liberal 
cities and on the campuses of America's universities. You would think 
my Democratic colleagues would be eager to show that Democrats don't 
support Hamas. Instead, they blocked my bill, proving that there is no 
interest in the Democratic Party to stand up to these people who hate 
Israel.
  That is why I will be asking today to make my amendment to add my 
Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act to this bill. I hope Democrats don't 
again oppose simply going on the record to vote on my commonsense 
measure. I hope we get a vote, and it passes.
  We have also tried twice to pass a stand-alone Israel aid bill that 
would not send money to Gaza, but Democrats blocked that, too. Each and 
every Democrat voted against aid to Israel. So don't tell me or my 
colleagues who oppose this bill that we don't stand with Israel when 
Democrats twice blocked our bill and then all voted against it--which 
has already passed in the House--to immediately send money to Israel.
  Let me be clear about one more thing: Since the day that Vladimir 
Putin launched Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine, I have stood 
strongly on the side of the Ukrainian people, but there are clearly 
numerous unanswered questions.
  What has happened to the more than $100 billion of aid that has gone 
to Ukraine? What is our plan to win? Why are we paying the salaries of 
Ukrainian politicians? Will Biden give Ukraine the weapons they need? 
Why can't Congress pay for this with savings from other areas? Why is 
the Ukraine border more important than the U.S. border?
  Ukraine must win, and Russia must lose. There is no question that is 
what is in the best interest of America's national security, and that 
is why I have said that we should continue to provide lethal aid to 
Ukraine, paid for with seized Russian assets so it can win its war and 
have a clear plan for how Ukraine will win. We need to answer these 
questions and be strategic about how we protect our interests, 
especially as we add to America's $34 trillion in debt.
  The American people will not tolerate borrowing billions of dollars 
to pay the government expenses and salaries of Ukrainian politicians, 
nor will they tolerate this government having no plan for how Ukraine 
will win, how American resources will help it win, and how we are 
making sure that every dollar spent is with one mission in mind: 
defeating Russia.
  Concern grows when we see that Ukraine has fired another top military 
official and seems to be struggling to show a clear path to victory. 
Without more information, we are left to assume the worst--that this 
entire bill has no clear mission but to accomplish the appearance of 
unity so that American politicians can fly over with a giant check and 
deliver hollow speeches about moral righteousness.
  It doesn't soothe our concerns when we hear the majority whip say on 
this floor that we must pass this bill now so that he can go to Munich 
this week and pontificate about a bill that the Speaker of the House 
has repeatedly stated will never become law. That accomplishes nothing. 
If my colleagues were serious about aiding Ukraine and its war against 
Russia's invasion, they would work with us in good faith to produce a 
bill that can pass here and in the House.
  As I said, I want Ukraine to win, and I want Russia to lose, but that 
does not mean that I am or should be willing to simply accept any offer 
thrown down by the Democrats that they claim--but

[[Page S888]]

cannot prove--will advance that cause or while America is being invaded 
as a result of our open border. I will not accept anything that ignores 
the most urgent threat to U.S. national security: Joe Biden's wide open 
border. This should not need to be said here on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate, but securing America's border is more important than securing 
the border of any other country. We should be able to do both.
  The fact that we aren't using revenue generated from seized Russian 
assets to pay for Ukraine aid is ridiculous, but that is how things 
work here. Your Federal Government cannot continue to write massive 
checks and borrow more money while providing zero accountability to the 
American people. I know the people of Florida are sick of it. We are 
all sick of it, and I think just about every American is sick of it.
  The deal has always been Ukraine aid for border security--not 
immigration policy but real border security now. Florida families are 
feeling the impact of this administration's lawless border policies 
every single day as deadly fentanyl, criminals, and terrorists pour--
pour--across Biden's open borders. There are 1,145 children between 14 
and 18 years old who died from fentanyl in 2021. What is the plan to 
stop that? That is a classroom of students dying every week.
  In 2022, I heard from a mom in Kissimmee, FL, whose son had a future 
in the Air Force and came home to visit her on Mother's Day weekend and 
surprised her. He, unfortunately, visited an old friend who he didn't 
know had begun dealing drugs. The friend convinced the young man to 
take a Xanax which was unknowingly laced with fentanyl, and the mom 
found her wonderful son dead. It is heartbreaking, and there are more 
stories like this.
  There are 100,000 Americans who died from drug overdoses in 2021 and 
72 percent of those from opioids like fentanyl. Families in Florida and 
every State across the Nation are being torn apart by these deadly 
drugs coming across the border. What is Joe Biden's plan to stop these 
drugs from coming across the border?
  My Democratic colleagues seem to finally be acknowledging this crisis 
on TV. Unfortunately, they are still unwilling to stand up to the 
President and force him to do what is right. We all know what is right: 
Secure the border. I can't imagine why. It is obvious to everyone that 
the invasion of our southern border is what Biden, unfortunately, 
wants. Just take a look at the numbers.
  On January 20 of 2021, Joe Biden took office and inherited the most 
secure U.S. southern border in modern history. In some of his first 
acts as President, he used his Executive power to dismantle the 
policies that President Trump used to secure the border and sent a 
clear message to the cartels: The border is now wide open for 
smuggling, and I won't do anything to stop you.
  The surge of illegal immigration started almost immediately.
  In February 2021, right after Biden was inaugurated, there were more 
than 101,000 encounters--101,000 encounters--of illegal aliens 
attempting to cross our southern border between ports of entry. If you 
go to the southern border, what you will see on the Mexico side are IDs 
everywhere. They want to come, but they don't want anybody to know who 
they are. If you had a stellar background, would you be doing that? No.
  That February, there was a massive increase from what we saw just the 
prior month. From there, the numbers continued to skyrocket. March 2021 
saw 173,000 encounters with illegal aliens between ports of entry. By 
July 2021, encounters with illegal aliens between ports of entry 
skyrocketed to more than 213,000. That is more than 213,000 people 
attempting to illegally enter the United States in just 1 month.
  I point this out to make something very clear: The border was secure. 
Then Joe Biden took office, and the cartels got his message loud and 
clear. The invasion hasn't stopped since. In fiscal year 2022--the 
first full fiscal year under the Biden administration--there were more 
than 2.3 million encounters with illegal aliens between ports of entry.
  These aren't families searching for a better life. They are mostly 
single adults. Of those 2.3 million encounters with illegal aliens at 
our southern border, more than 1.6 million were single adults, most of 
whom were military-aged men. That is 70 percent of all people who are 
trying to illegally enter the United States. Even more terrifying, 98 
of the people caught trying to illegally sneak into our country in 
fiscal year 2022 were on the Terrorist Watchlist.
  Here is another terrible stat for you from that period: The CBP 
seized more than 14,000 pounds of fentanyl along the southern border. 
Just 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be a lethal dose, and they seized 
more than 14,000 pounds. That is enough fentanyl to kill 3 billion 
people. This is how much fentanyl has crossed the border. Think about 
how much fentanyl has crossed the border without being seized.
  In fiscal year 2023, things got worse with more than 2.4 million 
encounters with illegal aliens between ports of entry. Again, these 
aren't mostly families searching for a better life; they are mostly 
single adults. Of these 2.4 million encounters with illegal aliens at 
our southern border, 60 percent, or more than 1.5 million, were single 
adults--again, most of whom are military-aged men. There were 169 
people on the Terrorist Watchlist who tried to illegally sneak into our 
country during fiscal year 2023, and we don't know where they are.
  The drugs continue to flow into our country. Last fiscal year, the 
CBP seized nearly 27,000 pounds of fentanyl along the southern border. 
That is enough fentanyl to kill 6 billion people.
  Last December, more than 300,000 illegal aliens were encountered 
trying to unlawfully enter the United States. This is an invasion and a 
clear and present danger to the safety of every American. Even Al 
Sharpton called it an invasion on his MSNBC show last week, but Senate 
Democrats and Joe Biden still won't do what is needed to fix it. Let me 
say that again: Biden's open border is a clear and present danger to 
every single American.
  In a hearing of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs 
Committee last October, I questioned FBI Director Christopher Wray 
about the threats that we are facing because of Joe Biden's open 
border.
  In his response to me, Director Wray said:

       We went through a period where the traditional-structured 
     Foreign Terrorist Organization threat in the U.S. subsided 
     some in favor of this inspired, ISIS-inspired, let's say, 
     attack . . . to be clear that threat has not gone away. What 
     has now increased is the greater possibility of one of these 
     Foreign Terrorist Organizations directing an attack in the 
     United States.

  In the United States.
  He went on to say:

       It is a time to be concerned. We are in a dangerous period.

  Since Joe Biden took office--this is Director Wray--``The terror 
threats have elevated.''
  I refuse to ignore this threat or pretend that it is OK to take care 
of the border in Ukraine while doing absolutely nothing to stop the 
invasion we have right here in the United States.
  I want to get something done, and I will always believe in the 
ability of our great Nation to answer the call and defend freedom and 
democracy wherever it is threatened by tyranny. I care deeply about 
protecting the national security of the United States. At 18 years old, 
I enlisted in the Navy to defend my country. My adoptive father was 1 
of 3,000 American soldiers who did all four combat jumps with the 82nd 
Airborne and then fought in the Battle of the Bulge.
  I know there is evil in the world and that America must be the leader 
of the free world. There is no one else to rely on, but we have to take 
care of the families we represent first. We have to secure our border 
today. This bill does not secure our border, and it has too many 
failures to say it will do what is needed to protect America and our 
interests. This bill allows Biden to send billions to Gaza, which would 
go straight to Hamas terrorists, and sends billions to pay the salaries 
of Ukrainian politicians. That is wrong.
  We all know that no bill is perfect. It is nearly impossible to write 
something that all 100 of us love and have no concerns about, but this 
isn't a situation where we can ignore some parts we don't like. The 
truth is that the things I have just outlined not only fund threats to 
U.S. national security by

[[Page S889]]

giving billions to Gaza that could go to Hamas, but they also 
recklessly force American taxpayers to borrow billions to pay for the 
salaries of foreign politicians while U.S. debt skyrockets to more than 
$34 trillion while doing nothing to secure our border--nothing to 
secure our border--nothing to secure the border of the United States 
where we have drugs, terrorists, criminals, and human traffickers 
flowing across. That could impact every one of our families. That is 
unacceptable. We can and must do better.
  So, today, I am once again going to ask that the Senate be given the 
opportunity to vote on my amendment to add the Stop Taxpayer Funding of 
Hamas Act to this bill. I am asking for a vote on my amendment.
  We have heard from colleagues that they were rightly concerned about 
the citizens of Gaza. If they were concerned about the citizens of 
Gaza, they should want this bill. They shouldn't want a dime to go to 
Hamas. They shouldn't want a penny to go to Hamas. They should want 
every dime--every dime--to go to the children who don't have the food 
they need.
  But in the meantime, shouldn't we spend more time thinking about the 
American hostages? Where is the conversation about the hostages? Where 
is the conversation about what we are doing to get the hostages home? 
What have we heard from Biden? What have we heard from my Democratic 
colleagues? Nothing.
  As I have said before in this Chamber, in August 2021, the Senate 
voted 99 to 0 for my amendment to a budget bill to ensure that U.S. tax 
dollars do not benefit terrorist organizations such as Hamas. It is a 
no-brainer. The vote was 99 to 0. Everyone in this body seems to agree 
that American taxpayers should never fund Hamas terrorists, but they 
don't want to do anything about it. They want to say it but do nothing 
about it. The final text of the bill written by Democrats does not 
include my language.
  We all know that Hamas controls Gaza. Every dollar that goes to Gaza 
comes under the control of Hamas, who decides what to do with it.
  We must make sure American tax dollars aren't funding terrorists. 
What my Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act does is make it so that no 
funds will be authorized for the territory of Gaza until the President 
certifies to Congress that these funds can be spent without benefiting 
terrorist organizations.
  It would also ensure U.S. funds are not authorized for expenditure in 
the territory of Gaza through any United Nations entity or office 
unless the President can certify that--the President will have to 
certify that it is not encouraging or teaching anti-Israel or anti-
Semitic ideas and propaganda.
  Finally, this bill mandates that the President certify that there are 
no hostages held in Gaza by any terrorist organization.
  Senate Democrats have both overwhelmingly supported this commonsense 
measure and blocked its passage in the past. Can anybody explain that? 
What will it be today?
  I sincerely hope that Democrats will stand against taxpayer money 
flowing to terrorists who want to destroy Israel and are still holding 
Americans hostage in Gaza.
  Let me just read the language that some people say prevents the money 
going to Hamas, and tell me if you come to the conclusion this doesn't.

       The Secretary of State shall certify and report to the 
     appropriate congressional committees not later than March 1, 
     2024--

  It is just a report. It doesn't mean they have to stop; it is just an 
after-the-fact report--

     that oversight policies, processes, and procedures have been 
     established by the Department of State and the United States 
     Agency for International Development, as appropriate, and are 
     in use to prevent the diversion, misuse, or destruction of 
     assistance, including through international organizations, to 
     Hamas and other terrorist and extremist entities in Gaza; 
     and--

  It doesn't stop it. They will just say: We will have policies and 
report on the policies--

     such policies, processes, and procedures have been developed 
     in coordination with other bilateral and multilateral donors 
     and the Government of Israel, as appropriate.

  The easy thing is none. The only policy you should have is, no money. 
Don't give a report that you had a policy and it wasn't enforced. Tell 
me that it never happened.
  Then it goes on to say:

       The Secretary of State and the USAID Administrator shall 
     submit to the appropriate congressional committees, 
     concurrent with the submission of the certification required 
     in subsection (a), a written description of the oversight 
     policies, processes, and procedures.

  We don't sign off on them. They are just going to give us a written 
description of them. We don't get to sign off on them. We don't get to 
question them. We don't get to change them. We don't get to vote on 
them. All it is is a written description of ``procedures for funds 
appropriated by this title that are made available for assistance for 
Gaza, including specific actions to be taken should such assistance be 
diverted, misused, or destroyed, and the role of Israel in the 
oversight of such assistance.''
  Israel doesn't have to sign off on it. It just says: What role did 
Israel play? The answer could be that Israel played no role.
  There is nothing in this--there will be nothing in this bill that is 
going to stop money from going to Hamas. There will be absolutely 
nothing. So anybody who says they are worried about the children in 
Gaza, there will be nothing to prevent money from going to Hamas 
instead.
  And I always say the first thing we ought to be talking about is how 
we get our hostages home.


             Unanimous Consent Request--Amendment No. 1542

  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside all pending 
amendments and motions and make my amendment No. 1542 pending to the 
text of Murray 1388; I further ask that there be 2 minutes of debate 
equally divided between the proponents and opponents and that following 
the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on adoption of 
the amendment, with a 60 affirmative vote threshold required for 
adoption.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from New Hampshire.
  Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we all 
share the grief and horror we saw unfold when Hamas committed the 
atrocities against the people of Israel. We all continue to work, as 
the President and his team have been doing, to find a way to get the 
hostages released while also addressing the humanitarian crisis in 
Gaza. But to cut off all humanitarian aid at this point in time would 
mean that innocent civilians and children in Gaza would be irrevocably 
harmed.
  We need to continue, as the administration is doing, to develop this 
framework, to get the hostages out, and to get a pause in the fighting 
while we do, but we also need to address the humanitarian crisis.
  I would also note that if my colleague from Florida is interested in 
securing the border, there was a bipartisan agreement to secure the 
border that Republicans turned and walked away from last week because 
they would rather keep this as a problem and a political issue than 
actually work to pass a solution. They could have, of course, after we 
had gone to the bill that included a border security package that was 
supported by the National Border Patrol Council, representing 18,000 
Border Patrol agents, because they knew it would make our border 
secure. They walked away from it.

  The last thing I will just say is that if we are interested in 
standing up to authoritarians and standing for freedom, as my father 
did in the Battle of the Bulge in World War II and as I just heard my 
colleague speak of how his father did the same, then we need to make 
sure that we make clear to Iran and to China and to North Korea and to 
Vladimir Putin that the United States of America stands for freedom.
  If my colleagues are serious about that, they will be supporting this 
bill.
  With that, I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.
  The Senator from Florida.
  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam President, what we have just witnessed on 
the Senate floor, I think, is disgusting.
  All I ask for is a vote. By blocking the Senate from even voting on 
my amendment to add the Stop Taxpayer Funding of Hamas Act to this 
bill, Democrats have done the work of

[[Page S890]]

Hamas here in the U.S. Senate. Senate Democrats just made clear they 
are so terrified of losing the votes of radical, Hamas-loving leftists, 
they cannot bring themselves to vote on an amendment--all I want is a 
vote; if I can't win it, it is my problem--to vote on an amendment that 
simply states that we are not going to send money to thugs who brutally 
murdered 1,200 innocent people, including more than 30 Americans, and 
are still--they are still holding American hostages.
  We are giving money to Gazans that can help Hamas. They are holding 
American hostages, and we are going to give them money.
  I can't imagine this is where we are, and this bill is going to do 
nothing to address this, while approving billions of dollars of aid. We 
have an open southern border, we have hostages in Gaza, and we are 
going to give Gazans aid that we know is going to go straight to Hamas. 
If you look at the text that I read, there is nothing that is going to 
prevent this money from going there.
  All my bill says is that all the President has to do is certify that 
the money is not going to go to Hamas, and the money can go to Gaza.
  I am disappointed.
  I wish to retain the balance of my time.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.
  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I come to the floor today as we debate 
really difficult, challenging, and serious issues. I am reminded that I 
didn't seek to be a U.S. Senator to do what we have been doing month 
after month--mostly spending each day dealing with confirmations and 
nominations. These issues we are debating and will ultimately vote on 
this week have consequences well beyond the things we have been 
normally dealing with in the U.S. Senate.
  Secretary Gates, a fellow Kansan, warned of the government's 
dysfunction at a moment in history in which he argues that our Nation 
``confronts graver threats to its security than it has in decades, 
perhaps ever.'' I agree with this assessment. We live in a dangerous 
time in a very dangerous world.
  I underscore to my colleagues the importance of doing the work we 
were elected to do. Americans will be directly impacted by our 
decisions but so will our adversaries and our allies. The United States 
must be a steadfast and reliable partner in the midst of so many 
dangers that threaten our Nation's peace and prosperity. The dangers 
are certainly to other people--other people within the world and other 
nations--but what we are dealing with are threats to our own national 
peace and prosperity.
  The national security crises abroad are challenging, and they are 
ever-increasing.
  China is rapidly modernizing its military, with the goal of being 
ready--ready--to invade Taiwan by 2027.
  Putin continues Russia's aggression in Ukraine, putting strain on 
European allies and on food supplies around the world.
  Iran is providing support for terrorism that is attacking our ships 
and bases and killed three servicemembers last month.
  Hamas has stated its attempt to wipe Israel off the map, even saying 
the terrorist attack on October 7 was just--was just--the beginning.
  North Korea's expansion of its nuclear arsenal places risk to us here 
in our homeland.
  In a joint FOX News op-ed that I penned with former Secretary Mike 
Pompeo, we stated this:

       The preservation of freedom requires enormous efforts; 
     indeed, liberty demands the marshaling of every resource 
     necessary in its defense against those who would see it 
     destroyed.

  Putin has chosen to pursue the reconstitution of the Russian Empire 
according to his own warped vision of Russian history, and he has made 
it clear that he has aspirations beyond Ukraine and that he views NATO 
as Russia's enemy.
  Under Putin's leadership, Russia has increasingly collaborated with 
other nations that oppose us--Iran, Syria, and our most powerful 
adversary, communist China.
  Allowing the war in Ukraine to fester will only prolong and deepen 
the instability already wrought, and it puts at greater risk 100,000 
U.S. servicemembers defending NATO's borders, including those from Fort 
Riley, KS.
  It is in America's national interest to assist Ukraine in repelling 
Russia's invasion.
  I thought about wearing a tie the color of Ukraine's flag. We see 
those every once in a while. I thought to myself, that is a mistake. 
While this has something to do with Ukraine, this is really about 
America, about the United States of America.
  We are doing what is necessary for our own well-being and our own 
preservation. Ending the war on terms favorable to Ukraine will leave 
Ukraine and NATO's front in a stronger and better position to deter 
further Russian aggression. By treaty--by NATO agreement--we have no 
choice that should Putin take the next step and invade a NATO member 
country, we will not just be supplying aid, but we will be supplying 
military young men and women.
  Allowing the war to continue is damaging. Allowing Ukraine to not be 
successful is damaging our own security and well-being. We must project 
strength. Failure to do so undermines our credibility, and that 
resonates around the globe.
  A large majority of the funding provided in this legislation to 
Ukraine--this legislation that says it is to Ukraine--has really been 
directly injected back into the United States economy. This bill 
provides $35 billion to replenish American stockpiles and develop and 
produce and purchase American-made weapons. This is not a blank check 
for Ukraine. It is not a blank check for Israel. It is not a blank 
check for Taiwan.
  There is nothing free about this. We are spending a lot of money. It 
is hugely expensive. However, in the absence of spending this money, we 
are going to be spending more later as the world continues to crumble.
  There is no path forward for Ukraine, there is no path forward for 
other countries that are looking for a brighter future, if the United 
States is disengaged from the world. I wish it wasn't true.
  I remember the first graduation speech I gave as a new Member of 
Congress. It was to a small town in West Central Kansas. And I said: 
Growing up, all we paid attention to was the price of grain at the 
grain elevator.
  What we had to know and what affected us in our lives in rural Kansas 
was something very local. I wish it was still that way. But we have 
no--no--alternative. We must engage in the world to protect our own 
selves. It isn't free, and it is spending a lot of money. But it is 
less expensive than the alternative.
  The price tag is overwhelming. The debt is damning to the future of 
our Nation. But in the absence of taking a stand now, we have to take a 
stand tomorrow. And that stand will be even more costly.
  The disastrous, chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, one of the 
saddest days or few days of my life--certainly in my life as an elected 
official--was watching the way things unfolded there. Certainly, it was 
damaging to people who were there, but it also has been damaging to our 
country in huge and significant ways.
  The whole world watched as a void in leadership resulted in the death 
of American servicemembers and stranded thousands of our Afghan 
allies--those who helped our service men and women, stranded them 
behind enemy lines, perhaps to their certain death.
  I was critical--and remain critical--of the Biden administration for 
the manner in which we came out of Afghanistan. And many of my 
colleagues--especially Republican colleagues--joined me in that 
criticism. But our failure to support our allies and partners around 
the world is a replication of what happened and what we did, what we 
didn't do, when we departed from Afghanistan in such an unthoughtful 
and haphazard way.
  We have an opportunity to partially remedy the situation by passing 
legislation to protect those Afghan citizens who helped save the lives 
and promote the success of American servicemembers.
  As we debate how to proceed in this national security supplemental, I 
would take this moment to remind my colleagues of the importance of a 
bill--the Afghan Adjustment Act--as we seek to attain a vote on an 
amendment

[[Page S891]]

to this bill to assure that those Afghan allies are not forgotten.
  As Kabul fell to the Taliban--and while I can certainly see the 
importance of this to those Afghans, this issue comes to me as a Member 
of this body who spends and devotes time to our veterans, to our 
military men and women--our veterans extended the creed ``leave no man 
behind,'' as they helped their Afghan partners flee to the United 
States for safety.

  I don't have the ability to undo what the Biden administration didn't 
do or what it did. I don't have the ability to change the outcome of 
their inept ability to lead on a global stage and defend the country. 
But we as Members of Congress can rein them or push them in a certain 
direction. The reality is the decisions made by the administration in 
Afghanistan have come back to haunt us. We sent a message to the world. 
In my view, it is the same message we would send if we failed to pass 
the emergency supplemental--hopefully--as amended.
  The administration continued its inaction at the border, and it is 
terribly frustrating. This administration has many tools it needs to 
improve the situation at our borders and, particularly, our southern 
border.
  I am disappointed we couldn't move forward on border policies as part 
of this package and to mandate the President to enforce the law. But it 
turned out there was no path forward on the border deal that would get 
the necessary votes in the Senate. And we wanted to succeed in having a 
border provision that not only worked and addressed seriously the 
problems on our border, but we also wanted to send a message to the 
House of Representatives that it is a piece of legislation that they 
could support. And, unfortunately, we never got there.
  Senator Lankford demonstrated leadership. He did what he was asked to 
do. I was in those meetings in which we talked about having a border 
provision of serious and significant magnitude before we moved forward 
with help to any other country. I continue to believe that that is the 
right course of action. But now it doesn't seem to be a course that we 
are able to succeed and put into effect. It will take a different 
Congress and a different administration.
  Kansans are right to be upset when their government does not enforce 
the laws, and they are right to be upset when we spend too much money. 
I am reluctant, as many of my constituents are, to spend more or to 
engage further in the world. But while I and many Kansans are angry and 
frustrated, our enemies abroad are on the march.
  There is not a day that goes by that I don't worry about what is 
happening elsewhere and not so much about what is happening elsewhere 
to people who are there but what happens in our own country if we don't 
deal with those circumstances today.
  It is always easier, I suppose, to look the other way. But often, 
when we do that, the end result suggests that we should have looked 
right in the face of the problem and taken it on. Our enemies are on 
the march.
  I try never to use my membership of the Senate Committee on 
Intelligence to say I know something that nobody else knows. I 
certainly never want to suggest to Kansans that I know something that 
they don't know. I trust their judgment and believe in them. But China, 
Russia, Iran, Iran and its proxies, North Korea are collaborating to 
weaken, to harm, and to attempt to make the United States abandon its 
leadership role.
  There is some morality to the decisions we make here. And I suppose 
there is an argument that can be made about the morality both ways, 
regardless of what we do. Morality--there actually is a right and 
wrong. I think we forget that in our country. Some things are right, 
and some things are wrong. And we try to finesse so that we never have 
to make the decision about which ones are which.
  I suppose right and wrong comes from, really, your soul, who you are 
as a person, how you grew up, what your parents taught you, what you 
learned in church or synagogue. I care about how my constituents feel.
  I indicated to my colleagues recently that we spend so much time 
doing next to nothing here, why do you take me away from my family, and 
why do you take me away from Kansans where I love to be? I would always 
prefer to be in Kansas. But every so often, there are issues that come 
before us that seem to be ones that explain why we are here. This is 
one of those moments in which we are finally escaping the drudgery and 
dissatisfaction of doing little.
  When I came to the U.S. Senate, I was welcomed here by then-Majority 
Leader Harry Reid. Senator Reid was polite and pleasant to me and 
always was; but on that day, on the first meeting as a new Senator here 
on the Senate floor, in that well, he said: Jerry, welcome. How do you 
like being here? My response was to Senator Reid: I was really honored 
that Kansans gave me the chance to do this job. But, sir, it doesn't 
seem like we are ever going to do anything.
  There is nothing about my life that would suggest that I would be a 
Member of the U.S. Senate; nothing in my background, nothing in my 
family. I wanted to come to the Senate to do something; to do something 
right; and to do it well.
  Senator Reid's response to me was: Jerry, you just need to 
understand, we are not going to do anything. You just need to know 
that.
  Here, I had just worked my way to the U.S. Senate only to discover 
that the job description was: ``Let's not do anything.''
  So I tried from that day to take what Senator Reid said and use the 
opportunity that I have been given by Kansans to do something--to do 
something right; to do something in cooperation with my colleagues; and 
to provide meaning for all those days away that me and my colleagues 
are away from home and family.
  When this is all over, I think we all want to actually do something 
that matters. Today, I tell my colleagues and my constituents and 
Americans that the challenge we face will not resolve themselves, and 
the preservation of freedom requires an enormous effort. It is a 
special place we live in--a special place we call home. And the freedom 
and position that we enjoy, we too often take for granted.
  It has been a while since--in fact, many in this body--many in 
Congress--no longer have served in the military. We tend to forget what 
that burden of serving means.
  We owe something to those who served. We owe something to a 
generation of hard-working men and women who have come before us. In my 
view, we owe them to live up to our responsibility to preserve what 
they have defended and protected and made available to me, to Americans 
today, and to our generation, our children and grandchildren, and 
Americans that we will never know.
  I believe in ``America First.'' But, unfortunately, ``America First'' 
means we have to engage in the world. Taking a sober view of history, 
there should be no doubt of the importance of the outcome in Ukraine, 
the Middle East, in China, in the South Pacific, and what it means to 
the United States.
  I go back to what Secretary Pompeo said with me in that FOX News 
opinion piece:

       The preservation of freedom requires enormous effort; 
     indeed, liberty demands the marshaling of every resource 
     necessary in its defense against those who would see it 
     destroyed.

  I am not the articulate individual that President Reagan was, but he 
said it well, perhaps better, than what I and Secretary Pompeo said. 
President Reagan said in his first inaugural address--his first 
inaugural address to become President:

       The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the 
     kind of sacrifice that . . . so many thousands of others 
     [have been] called upon to make. It does require, however, 
     our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves 
     and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds, to 
     believe that together with God's help we can and will resolve 
     the problems which now confront us.

  I am tired of telling people when they ask me how I am--I say: Well, 
I am fine. My family is fine. The world is a mess.
  You can't differentiate the two. Your family, you can't be fine if 
the world is crumbling. That is me, not Reagan.
  President Reagan concluded:

       Together with God's help, we can and will resolve the 
     problems which now confront us.
       And after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are 
     Americans.

  I reserve my time.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.
  Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I want to thank my friend and colleague

[[Page S892]]

from Kansas for the speech that he just gave. I would like to associate 
myself with every single word.
  Madam President, last Thursday, I came to the floor to explain to the 
pages who were on duty then--I think they are different now--and to a 
few people in the Gallery what was about to happen. Then I told them 
what was about to happen was that a lot of people were going to file a 
lot of amendments. There were going to be some people who wouldn't do 
time agreements. And then we would come to the floor, and we would hem 
and haw about how either Leader Schumer, the majority leader, or Mitch 
McConnell, the minority leader, somehow blocked them. Well, that is 
fiction. I am not a fortuneteller. I have seen this play before. And 
what played out over this weekend is exactly what happened in the past, 
where people are making objections without any good-faith offer to 
negotiate time, et cetera.
  So what happens? Great amendments, like those that are being offered 
by Senator Lee, are likely not going to get a vote. Great amendments by 
Tom Cotton, Rick Scott, and other Members are likely not going to get a 
vote. I hope, maybe, that changes, but unless we decide to negotiate in 
good faith--and I don't know why anybody thinks that they will. So it 
is disappointing, but it is not surprising, and that is exactly what I 
was thinking on Thursday.
  And, now, here we are on Monday.
  I have one other thing.
  I had some of my colleagues come to the floor. They referred to the 
fact that I made a statement that says: I feel like it is on me to vote 
the way I think I need to vote, and then go back home and explain it.
  Why? Well, because a lot of people, when they hear a Senator speak, 
they believe that it is the truth. They heard somebody say that, if we 
pass this bill, we are all going to go ride to Kyiv with buckets full 
of money and let oligarchs buy yachts.
  I wonder how the soldier in a trench right now in Ukraine, defending 
against Russians, feels about that. I wonder how the spouses of the 
estimated 25,000 soldiers in Ukraine who have died feel about that. I 
mean, really, guys, sending billions of dollars to Ukraine so Ukrainian 
oligarchs can buy yachts; is that the best you have?
  What we are talking about is funding for the next 10 months. Then we 
have other people say a forever war--a forever war. Well, the last time 
I checked, this appropriations runs out at the end of this calendar 
year. And then, next year, we will have to fight again, either under a 
Biden administration or a Trump administration, to continue to do the 
right thing.
  A lot of people say we are sending $70, $80 billion to Ukraine. 
Really? Well, the last time I checked, about half of it is going to the 
military industrial base here to replace the inventories we sent to 
them, to replace and aid the modernization of our arsenal. We have 
billions of dollars in this bill to actually build up our defense 
industrial base that we now know--thank goodness this is not against a 
NATO ally because we would be desperate trying to actually support all-
out war now.
  Thank you, Vladimir Putin. If anything good came from this, we know 
how weak your military is--a 10-to-1 ratio of Ukrainians to Russian 
soldiers dead. I feel bad for every one of those Russian families who 
lost somebody in this war they didn't want to be a part of--87 percent 
of their ready forces when Putin started this war.
  Putin is losing this war, folks. This is not a stalemate. This guy is 
on life support. He will not survive if the 50 nations that have come 
together in the Ramstein process to support Ukraine stick together. He 
will not survive if NATO becomes stronger.
  NATO already has one and is about to have a second ally that is only 
here because of Vladimir Putin. He has made NATO stronger. He has 
demonstrated that he is weak. He has demonstrated that he is losing.

  We all heard the classified reports that are now public that we 
thought that Russia was going to have air superiority within a couple 
of days and control all Ukraine that they wanted to control within a 
couple of weeks. Folks, that was 2 years ago. Ukraine is winning, and 
Ukraine is winning because the Western world, the NATO allies in 25, 
some two-dozen other countries have come together and made it very 
clear that Putin's desire to reestablish the Russian Empire is 
inconsistent with the democratic world order.
  Putin is losing. This is not a stalemate. A 10-to-1 kill differential 
between Ukrainians and Russians is indisputable. The platforms that he 
is leaving on the battlefield are indisputable. The fact that we need 
to modernize and build up our industrial base is indisputable. Thank 
you, Vladimir Putin, for bringing that to our attention.
  And guess what else. China is watching. I am less concerned about 
Vladimir Putin than I am about China and our retreat from leading the 
Western world.
  Guess what. We are an exceptional Nation, and we are the beacon of 
hope for democracy. When we step away, who fills the void? You would be 
hard-pressed to find any nation that has the scale and the ability to 
do it but the United States, with all due respect to my friends in 
NATO.
  China is watching.
  Why am I so focused on this vote? Because I don't want to be on the 
pages of history that we will regret if we walk away. You will see the 
alliance that is supporting Ukraine crumble. You will ultimately see 
China become emboldened, and I am not going to be on that page of 
history.
  I believe that we have to vote today, and we have to respect some of 
the priorities--maybe the concerns of the House as they move this 
through--but let's let this Chamber be the Chamber that stands with the 
free world. That is what we can do today. That is what we must do 
today.
  And what I must do is go to my great State of North Carolina, and, if 
I have friends who think otherwise, I owe it to them to share every bit 
of knowledge that I have, to have them understand that I don't love 
where we are today, but I hate where we will be if we don't move 
forward with this vote.
  I reserve the remainder of my time.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heinrich). The Senator from Kansas.
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the supplemental 
bill that is before us, but what should be appropriately called the 
``Ukraine funding bill.''
  It is only in America where we try to fund other nation's problems, 
to fight other people's wars for them, before we fix our own budget.
  We are just weeks away from our own government funding ending. We had 
the President's budget, which was due several weeks ago--we don't have 
that budget. We have not done the funding for this year yet. Yet we are 
moving on to a supplemental bill, of course, all in the background of 
$34 trillion of debt.
  A couple of things to point out about this supplemental bill. Stating 
the obvious, there is no border security in this bill--nothing to 
secure our border. We are about to send almost $100 billion overseas 
without addressing our most imminent national security threat that our 
Nation faces: our open southern border.
  I want to start also by saying this. I am not apologetic about being 
a patriot. A patriot is a person that puts America first. Look, I am 
always going to root for my home team, the Panthers. I am always going 
to root for the Kansas City Chiefs. I don't wish other players any ill 
will, but I will always be an American first. When the American hockey 
team is playing the Russian hockey team, I am going to root for the 
American hockey team. If the American soccer team is playing the German 
soccer team, I am going to root for the American team. I don't have ill 
will toward the others. I will be American first and set American 
priorities first.
  I think the next thing we need to point out about this bill is that 
two-thirds of Republican Senators voted against it. Two-thirds of 
Republican Senators have voted against proceeding with this 
legislation. In a Republican-controlled House, I don't see how you are 
going to find more than 50 percent of those Republicans to pass this 
bill. It just isn't going to happen.
  As I take a look at these last 4 months up here, I realize that the 
White House negotiating on securing the border was actually a charade. 
They were never serious about it. And, of course, it never made sense 
to the folks back home. Why would we have

[[Page S893]]

to beg the President of the United States to secure our own border? Why 
would we have to negotiate over that? Why would we have to give them 
Ukraine funding in return for a secure border? It makes sense to 
nobody.
  I want to take a second and talk about why this is important--why 
this issue is important--why are so many of us standing up and fighting 
against this $95 billion to never-ending wars.
  I think, as I even consider the 300 people who die from fentanyl 
every day in this country, this is important. The fact that we don't 
secure our border is going to allow more of that fentanyl into this 
country. We are seeing just upshots and upshots of human trafficking, 
sex trafficking going on across our Nation. As FBI Director Wray said, 
he sees warning, blinking lights everywhere he looks for the first time 
in his career.
  Why wouldn't we? Why wouldn't we when we have over 10 million people 
who have crossed our borders illegally in the last 3 years?
  So I think it is important from a national security standpoint. This 
is important to secure our Nation and to make our families safe again.
  I want to talk for a moment about whom we are fighting for. This is 
no longer just our own border issue. I am fighting for families back 
home. Every State is now a border State. Fentanyl poisoning kills a 
person almost every day in the State of Kansas.
  So I am fighting for all those people who died. You know, I just read 
this week about a young lady in Kansas who has lost four members of her 
family from fentanyl poisoning and most recently, over the past several 
weeks, lost a child to fentanyl poisoning. So I am fighting for all of 
those who lost a loved one to fentanyl poisoning.
  For all those people who are being human-trafficked as we speak, are 
being sex-trafficked as we speak as well, I am fighting for all of 
those people.
  I think it is important to take a second and talk about how we got 
here, you know, how we got to these open borders. This President likes 
to create a crisis, and then he tries to solve it. In this situation, 
the President of the United States created this open border crisis.
  This President penned over 90 Executive orders that opened that 
southern border, to go from less than 1,000 crossing a day to now, many 
days, having over 10,000 a day. These were Executive orders. It was 
policies that changed. The President created this crisis. Even today, 
the President could end that crisis. The President could shut down the 
border. He has the legal authority today to shut down the border, to 
secure the border.
  How did we get thrown into the Ukraine war? Another crisis created by 
our current President.
  You know, I would go back to Afghanistan. When America ran with her 
tail between her legs out of Afghanistan, we lost our reputation. This 
President lost his reputation, and, as I have been taught by so many 
physicians in my own practice, once a professional loses their 
reputation, you can never get it back.
  Then you fast-forward, and you see that this President will not 
respond to Iran's attack on Americans through their puppets with any 
type of significant response. I think it just basically allows our 
enemies to push us around and to shove us.
  How did we get to the Israel situation where Hamas came to be--where 
Hamas had the courage to cross the borders to brutally attack and 
murder thousands of Israelis? I think, again, it is this lack of 
respect. It was a lack of respect.
  It was this President's policies that allowed Iran to increase their 
sales of oil, to allow their economy to grow, to allow them to fund and 
to ship weapons to these puppets of theirs, these terrorists.
  I think an even bigger picture of how we got here is just the 
lawlessness in America today. The lawlessness started with an open 
southern border, cashless bail, turning our heads away from riots, the 
smash-and-grabs, turning our eyes away from these to see the 
lawlessness grow and then to see the fentanyl explode. As my dad, the 
police officer, taught me, wherever there are illegal drugs, crime is 
certainly going to follow it as well.
  So I think in this backdrop of a lawless America, where our 
constitutional rights are being attacked and where, on the world stage, 
a President lost his reputation, it allowed Russia to have the courage 
to attack Ukraine, and it allowed Hamas the courage to attack the 
people of Israel.
  As I look at the big picture of this legislation--$60 billion for 
Ukraine--I think of what else we could do with that. Do you realize 
that the entire annual budget of the Marines is only $53 billion? How 
much more national security would we have if we invested the money in 
our Marines as opposed to sending this money abroad? We could have 
built three walls on the southern border easily with this amount of 
money, maybe much more.
  As leaders, we need to focus on priorities, and I think that is what 
America is seeing right now. I think they are seeing these two-thirds 
of Republicans who voted against proceeding with this supplemental 
bill--we were folks who put our own national security first, put 
securing the border first. But up here in DC, my friends across the 
aisle and the White House--they continue to put Ukraine funding as 
their priority.
  Of course, add to that the complexity of the situation. Each one of 
these issues, even by itself, has merits. There are reasons to push 
them, and there are reasons that you wouldn't do it certain ways. But 
when you throw them all together, it is next to impossible to solve 
this Rubik's Cube, if you will, just seemingly next to impossible.
  You know, one of the things that the national media especially likes 
to do up here is declare within hours of a vote who was right and who 
was wrong. I think it is important to realize that oftentimes we don't 
know who is right or wrong for years, for decades after. And even 
sometimes they write the history books, and they don't get it right.
  I certainly have empathy for those who support Ukraine funding right 
now. And I could be wrong. I could be wrong that this is not the proper 
time to do it. But what I am not wrong on is securing the border, that 
that should be the top priority. Once we secure our own border, then 
let's look abroad and see what we can do to help with Ukraine as well.
  As I think about the border and the significance of the problem, I 
think about the number of people who have died from fentanyl poisoning. 
I know I keep bringing up this fentanyl poisoning, but it is so 
significant--300 people, 300 young adults, young Americans, dying every 
day from fentanyl poisoning.
  You try to put that into historical perspective. Pearl Harbor--a day 
that lives in infamy--2,400 American soldiers died. So that would be 8 
days in February that the same number of people died from fentanyl. 
Every 8 days, we lose the same number of Americans we lost in Pearl 
Harbor, a horrible tragedy.
  Of course, 9/11, some 3,000 people died there. In 10 days--you know, 
just this month of February alone, we have lost more Americans to 
fentanyl poisoning than we lost to 9/11.
  D-day, 2,500 Americans died. Again, in just the month of February, we 
have lost more Americans to fentanyl poisoning than we did to D-day.

  So I think that is what we should be focused on. We should be 
securing our border to stop the flow of fentanyl into this country, to 
stop the human trafficking, to stop the sex trafficking, for all those 
reasons.
  I want to talk a little bit more about what border security looks 
like. Many of us have been to the border multiple times. You know, the 
Border Patrol officers, I think, would be one group of credible people. 
At my last visit, what they focused on was that they need policy 
changes.
  I think it is important that Americans realize that we would have 
proceeded with this bill if there was meaningful border security in the 
original legislation. Again, all the border security has been stripped 
out of this bill, but it is important for Americans to know what was 
missing.
  The Border Patrol officers themselves said that this bill--to make 
America truly secure, we needed more work on asylum, more work on the 
parole issue, and then this magic number of 5,000 and the border shuts 
down--not that it really ever did under this legislation, of course; 
the border never really shut down--that that 5,000 was way

[[Page S894]]

too high and to codify that into law would almost make that the norm.
  Again, the Border Patrol would say: We really can't deal with more 
than 1,000 people crossing the border a day. And even 1,000 is a huge 
stress, and they recommended that whenever we hit 1,000, we would 
literally shut the border down.
  So, again, if this bill would have been negotiated in broad daylight, 
if it would have gone through the Judiciary Committee, went through 
some type of a process where we could have addressed that particular 
number on the parole situation--I think it is so important that 
Americans understand that under President Obama, he was paroling 5,000 
people per year. Barack Obama, President Obama, was paroling 5,000 
people per year. President Trump, 5,000 people per year. Joe Biden, 
700,000 people per year. So this President was illegally or is 
illegally paroling over 700,000 per year.
  Now, what is the magic number that should be? Is it 5,000? Is it 
10,000? I think that we in the Republican caucus were willing to 
negotiate that number and that if there were some extenuating 
circumstances, then the President could come to this body and say: Hey, 
we need more than that number. But just to say that as long as they are 
flown in--and by the way, the vast, vast majority of those parolees are 
flown in on, of course, American taxpayer dollars. So think about that. 
Two million people have been paroled under President Biden--2 million 
people flown into this country for the most part on American taxpayer 
dollars and given a work visa. I wonder how that makes my union workers 
feel--like 2 million people entering the workforce here, willing to 
work for minimum wage or less.
  So this bill did not correct the parole situation, that they could 
continue to come into this country as long as they were flown in.
  Then there is the asylum issue. What this legislation did, again, was 
basically codify catch-and-release. Yes, some of the people were being 
caught and retained, but a significant number were still being caught 
and released for who knows how long.
  So that is the bare minimum that needed to occur on this bill to make 
it palatable because we wanted meaningful border security. We wanted to 
address asylum, address parole, and then this magic number of 5,000 
when people cross the border, and those number of encounters, that we 
would change it, that that would shut down the border.
  So I hope that dispels any questions or concerns about what we would 
like to do with border security.
  I want to talk about Ukraine for a second a little bit more as well.
  As I assess Ukraine, I certainly feel for the folks there. You know, 
this has been a battle for thousands of years over the borders of 
Ukraine. But where we are today, I think it is very disingenuous--very 
disingenuous--to say that this war is anything but a stalemate.
  Look, the war front has not moved in over a year's time. It is a 
quagmire. But meanwhile, 200,000 Ukrainians have died, and maybe twice 
that number of Russians have died, probably 1 million casualties with 
no end in sight. This is a never-ending war, just like the Afghan war. 
I am not sure how long Russia was there but for years and years, and 
then America was there for years and years. But just due to the 
terrain, due to all the circumstances there, there appears to me to be 
no end in sight, and anyone who says otherwise I think is just not 
being intellectually honest with themselves or with Americans.
  I think the focus should be on some type of peace talks right now, 
not on fueling this fire, not on throwing more gasoline on this fire, 
not sending them more and more weapons. I think that if there is a 
will, there is a way, and that if America was leading on some type of a 
peace talk, I think we could have already been there by now.
  But one of the challenges we have with a President who has lost his 
reputation is trying to slow Putin down. So he is in this for the long 
haul. He is not going to step down. He is not going to step back when 
he sees a weak President that we have who is even afraid of Iran.
  So for all those reasons, I cannot support funding to Ukraine at this 
point in time. I think we have to secure our border first, and then I 
am willing to talk about funding for Ukraine. But I need to know what 
is the path to victory, what is our goal here, what some type of a 
realistic schedule looks like for that war coming to a conclusion.
  This legislation before us even promises money for future years--
again, misinformation being passed around by some of my colleagues. So 
this bill commits future Presidents to funding this Ukraine war. And by 
the way, there are a lot of Americans back home who don't think this is 
a good idea at all.
  Look, I grew up in the Vietnam era. I remember what it was like on my 
way to my grandparents to drive by the cemetery and see coffins draped 
with the American flag and the bugler playing ``Taps'' on a regular 
basis--too often a person I saw playing high school football last 
season, and here their life had ended.
  I don't want more wars; I want less wars. But right now, we are 
projecting weakness. Joe Biden has given us war through weakness 
instead of peace through strength.
  Let's turn our attention to Israel and Iran--Hamas as well--just for 
a moment.
  First of all, I want to remind everybody, four times we came to this 
floor and asked for unanimous consent for stand-alone funding for 
Israel.
  And I would do that again tonight if I thought it would be of any 
benefit, if I thought that it had a chance.
  I support funding Israel. Israel has been one of America's--if not 
their best ally, certainly one of their top allies of all times, 
faithful to us, a great source of intelligence. They have stopped so 
many foreign attacks on this land that we--many Americans--owe their 
life to the work that the people of Israel have done. And then, just in 
general, they are being attacked by a terrorist group that not only 
wants to destroy Israel but destroy America.
  Why wouldn't we support Israel?
  But, of course, the issue of Israel now tears the Democratic Party 
apart. It divides them. You know, it looks like, to me, many of them 
are very concerned about supporting Israel, that they have become this 
pro-Palestinian caucus rather than a pro-Israel caucus. They support 
Iran, but not Israel.
  Look, in the world of the Middle East, you can't do both. I don't see 
how you could possibly support Israel and Iran. I don't see how you 
could support Israel and support Hamas. I don't think it is possible. I 
think sometimes you have to choose and support who your friends and 
allies are. And, for me, I believe we should be standing firmly beside 
Israel and eliminating Hamas.
  Again, Hamas wants to destroy Americans. That is their goal. That is 
their stated purpose.
  So we would have--almost to a person, we would have supported some 
type of stand-alone funding for Israel, if given that chance.
  We talked about Israel. We talked about Hamas. We have to talk about 
Iran. There is so much more that this President could be doing right 
now, besides just funding Israel. Look, Hamas is the head of the snake. 
They are the ones that fund, train, support, plan these attacks by 
these puppets of theirs, these terrorist organizations in so many ways.
  So what could the President do besides, you know, funding more wars 
and more battles? I think that there is a military approach. There is 
an economic approach, and there is a diplomatic approach.
  Let's talk a minute about the diplomatic approach. The Abraham 
Accords are making great progress in the Middle East, and perhaps one 
of the most precipitating factors of Hamas attacking Israel was the 
progress of these Abraham Accords, that Israel was close to working out 
an agreement with our friends from Saudi Arabia. And if they would have 
done that, it would have put so much pressure on Iran.
  Well, basically, Hamas attacked on October 7, and now those talks 
have been cut off. But, if somehow, some way, those negotiations, those 
talks could be rekindled, that would indirectly put a huge amount of 
pressure on Iran. So there are huge opportunities for a diplomatic 
approach.
  Economically, let's talk about what we could be doing. Recall when 
Joe Biden was sworn in, Iran had about $6 billion of currency left--$6 
billion in their treasury. Well, today they have

[[Page S895]]

got over $60 billion. Why? Because the sanctions that we had on, under 
the Trump administration, were lifted, and now Iran easily is selling 
all this oil, and, among other things, they have a fleet of 500 ghost 
ships.
  So they take these ships that are owned by foreign countries. They 
use that foreign flag then to smuggle either Russian oil or Iranian oil 
to people, ignoring the sanctions. We should be punishing not just Iran 
but also punishing those countries that lend them their flag, so to 
speak.
  What else could we do economically? I think that we could be 
putting--double-down on all the previous economic sanctions that we 
placed on them, including bank sanctions. And, again, anyone that is 
doing business with Iran, we could be shutting them down as well.
  Militarily, what could we do? I think back to what President Reagan 
did in 1988 when an American warship was attacked. I believe it hit a 
mine, if I recall properly. And what President Reagan did is he ordered 
an attack on Iranian oil platforms, and I think we also sunk three of 
their battleships as well. So without going inside of Iran proper, we 
sent a loud and clear message to Iran. And guess what. It worked.
  Instead, what the Biden administration has chosen to do are these 
fairly innocuous attacks on empty sheds, and maybe sometimes there is 
some old ammunition there. But something more than that needs to be 
beefed up.
  We need to shut down Iran's ships as they are crossing through the 
seas as well. Iran launched three military satellites recently. We 
could take out those military satellites. So there is a lot we could 
do, but this idea of passivity, this idea that if we just watch what 
Iran is doing and thinking that they are going to stop doing it, 
doesn't work. Anyone that has faced a bully in third grade out at 
recess knows being passive never works, and, eventually, you have to 
stand up and smack the bully in the nose. Otherwise, he is going to 
keep pestering you.
  It is that clear. That is what we should be doing in the Middle East 
right now. It is a military action on Iran, economic and diplomacy as 
well. You can't look at that in just a little silo. We should be 
supporting Israel, but all those other things would help Israel 
significantly as well.
  There is funding in this legislation for Taiwan. And, again, I think 
if that was standing alone, I could support it.
  I think back to pre-invasion of Ukraine by Russia. We begged the 
White House to make Ukraine some type of a porcupine, so to speak. That 
would have been our goal--that we should have been getting all the 
military aid in there before this all happened, not after. We could 
have gotten them A-10s that we were mothballing.
  Pardon me. I don't know what is going on, Mr. President.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I don't know either.
  The Senate will be in order.
  Would the person in the Gallery please sit.
  Mr. MARSHALL. Thank you, Mr. President. I didn't know what type of 
security situation there was there. So we felt that we had better just 
pause as well.
  So if we were talking about Taiwan, I think we can compare Taiwan to 
where Ukraine was a couple of years ago. We begged this administration 
to arm Ukraine so that they could protect themselves. If we could have 
gotten them those A-10 Warthogs--think about how that war would have 
changed if Ukraine had these A-10 Warthogs, as all of these Russian 
supply automobiles were stuck there trying to enter from the north. 
There is so much more that we could have done. It seems like this White 
House has just slow-walked the entire response.
  So, yes, I think many of us agree that we should help arm Taiwan to 
make them a porcupine. And, by the way, they have been a great ally, 
too, a great business partner. They seem to be a good player, a country 
that we greatly respect and want to help protect.
  But, at the end of the day, when you bundle this funding without 
giving us our own border security, that doesn't make much sense to us.
  And, of course, there is funding in here for humanitarian aid as 
well, I think to the tune of--goodness, I think it is close to $10 
billion for humanitarian aid. This is in addition to what we typically 
are doing. We would remind everybody that USAID has a budget of over 
$60 billion a year, that we are all doing much of this humanitarian 
work already.
  And, of course, our fear--and I don't know how to answer Kansans 
thoughts on this when they ask me: How are we going to make sure that 
that humanitarian aid gets to women and children, the people that 
really need it, as opposed to--will Hamas intercept it?
  Again, I made several trips to the Middle East, and what I have seen 
is corruption. I have seen the terrorist groups grab the humanitarian 
aid, and it doesn't get to the people that we want it to get to there. 
So I am not convinced on the humanitarian aid part of this that we 
would accomplish what our goals truly, truly are.
  I don't think that this humanitarian aid should be going to support 
Hamas. I am all for helping those that need it, but very concerned 
about where it actually ends up being.
  I want to go back to the budget process just for a second as well. I 
have never have been part of an organization that functions quite like 
this. Most of us have run businesses before or have been on a church 
board or a school board. You know, typically, the fiscal year is going 
to be starting 4 or 5 months from now. We want our CFOs giving us a 
budget outline. We want to be presenting those budgets to the board at 
least 6 weeks before that new year kicks in and certainly ready to go 
before the new year starts.
  This body seldom does a budget. They seem to just fly by the seat of 
their pants. They do a cost-plus system. Whatever we spent this year, 
we are immediately talking about adding 5 or 10 percent to that budget, 
regardless. As opposed to that, I think we should go back to a zero-
based budgeting process. I think we should go back exactly to the way 
the budget of the law of 1974 says we should be doing and then put some 
teeth on it, so if the President doesn't get his budget here on time, 
that there is some type of punishment, if you will, for the White House 
not getting that here on time, within the realms of the Constitution. I 
know there are some certain things we can't do, and I really think a 
President--a responsible President--could have that budget to us 
before--you know, months before the fiscal year ends as well.
  And then I think we should hold the Senate Budget Committee to the 
test and make sure that they get a budget out in time. And then we 
communicate that to the House, and they work on a budget, and we go 
back to this regular order that we have all talked about.
  And my compliments to the Appropriations Committee here in the 
Senate. I think they have done an incredible job, especially with the 
time presented to them, to at least giving us something. It has been 
through subcommittees; it has been through committees--for the most 
part, with large bipartisan support. We would have loved to have had 
them out here by now. We would have loved to have taken those 
packages--there are 12 buckets--taken them one at a time and gone 
through them and shine the light on the bridges to nowhere. Maybe there 
are places we need to accentuate, things that we could cut back.
  In a Federal budget of--goodness, I guess we are at $77 trillion a 
year now. You would think there would be some ways--there would be some 
programs that we could shut down, as opposed to, again, just this cost-
plus system that we do up here: Whatever is last year's budget, let's 
just add 5 percent; let's just add 10 percent as well.
  And it still amazes me that, again, having a $900 billion military 
budget, we are going to have to go back now and spend even more to fund 
these never-ending wars overseas as well.
  So I do think that we need to pay attention to what is going on with 
our budget process.
  I had some folks back home send me some questions, and I thought I 
would try to answer them. Some of them I have covered already, but I 
think this is a good opportunity to talk about some of their questions 
as well.
  The first question: Were the Democrats ever serious about border 
security?
  Listen, I think there are folks in the Democratic Party that want 
border security. I don't know if it is as much of

[[Page S896]]

a priority as it is to me. I would like to assume that they do.
  But, on the other hand, it feels like, for the White House, that is 
not their priority. I think I have never heard from the White House 
that border security is a priority. They talked about an immigration 
system, wanting to grease an immigration system, but I never really 
heard that commitment from the White House that they wanted border 
security.
  Next question: Why is it so urgent to send Ukraine this largest lump 
sum of money right now when the war started over 2 years ago?
  I think that is a great question. Again, I would just point out that 
the situation there is a quagmire. I know that Ukraine is starting to 
launch offensive weapons into Russia, which concerns me. It concerns me 
about escalating a war as well. I think we need to realize that, in the 
stalemate situation, I am not sure why we need to be sending them more 
and more weapons. Again, the focus, I believe, should be on some type 
of peace talks.
  Next question: Has Israel been used as a pawn in these negotiations, 
and what message does this send to our allies like Israel?
  Well, Israel has been used as a pawn. As I pointed out before, Israel 
divides my friends across the aisle, so that much of their base no 
longer supports Israel. So when their base sees them thinking about 
funding Israel, it creates division. It creates havoc. It hurts the 
President's poll numbers.
  So I think that Israel has felt like a pawn. Again, what some will 
say is that the President is using the Ukraine funding as an excuse to 
include the Israel funding.
  Next question--again, these are questions from folks back home that 
wanted to make sure that I answered this: How does funding Ukraine 
address our No. 1 national security concern, the border crisis, as well 
as our long-term concern of our national debt crisis?
  You know, I couldn't agree more. Our No. 1 most immediate threat to 
our national security is an open southern border. The greatest threat 
to our long-term national security is our $34 trillion national debt.
  Look, we are going to spend more money on interest this year than we 
do on the military. When any business is spending that significant 
amount of their budget--probably, I am going to guess around 1/7th of 
our budget this year--1/7th will be spent on interest. I think, 
whenever that happens, that threatens our education programs. It 
threatens our roads and bridges. Any type of long-term infrastructure 
that we could be investing in, if we are going to be spending $900 
billion or trillion on interest, we know that is a tough row to hoe. 
Any business that is ran, when you are that far in debt, spending that 
much in interest soon ends up in some type of bankruptcy.

  So this bill does not address--actually, it worsens our long-term 
national security crisis with the national debt. It certainly does not 
address the border in any way.
  Next question: When will the President realize that deterrence 
doesn't work after the fact?
  Well, I think, again, that is the difference in our philosophies 
here. I always believed President Eisenhower actually said it first. He 
said he believed in ``peace through strength.'' President Eisenhower 
said he hated wars as only a soldier could, as a soldier who has lived 
it and seen its brutality and futility as well.
  As a veteran myself and the brother and son of a veteran and uncles 
who were soldiers and a child who is now in the Active-Duty military, I 
certainly understand the importance of peace through strength and hope 
that we can regain some of that strength as the military begins to 
focus once again on military strength and readiness, as opposed to some 
of the other diverse issues.
  Next question: Why is putting America's safety and security so 
controversial?
  I can't answer that question. To me, it is not controversial. Of all 
my tasks up here, again to our priorities, I think my No. 1 priority is 
to make America safe and secure--I think physically safe with secure 
borders and then financially secure would be right behind that as well.
  Next question: Who within the American Government is responsible for 
overseeing how this money is spent in Ukraine? Whose job has it been to 
this point?
  Well, look, I think many of us have been concerned that there wasn't 
an individual person, an inspector general, focused on this $113 
billion we have already spent. We know that whenever you send over 
large amounts of money at one time, the opportunity for fraud and abuse 
is there. Many leaders of our own country are concerned about the fraud 
in Ukraine as well.
  So I cannot look Kansans in the eye and say, Hey, we know where all 
this money is going. For heaven's sakes, the Department of Defense 
doesn't know where most of its assets are either. It has gotten so big, 
they can't keep track of what they have or where they have it.
  Next question: Why don't we bring Russia and Ukraine to the 
negotiating table to bring peace, instead of funding death and 
destruction indefinitely?
  I couldn't agree with you more. I think we have the leverage. I think 
we have the economic leverage. Even our trade with these foreign 
countries alone gives us a leverage that most people don't have to 
bring them to the negotiating table.
  Next question: How can we be sure that humanitarian aid to the Gaza 
Strip can be used to help civilians and not fall into the hands of 
Hamas terrorists?
  I can't. I cannot be sure of that. We know if history repeats itself, 
that significant amounts of aid have fallen into the hands of these 
terrorists.
  Next question: What is the end goal of Ukraine?
  That is a great question.
  It wasn't too long ago that Ukrainian leadership was here saying they 
wanted to go back to pre-Crimea. Basically, they want Crimea back, as 
well as the other territory that Russia has invaded and controls as 
well. I don't know that that is feasible or not, to think that they are 
going to get Crimea back. Crimea is so important to Putin. Folks don't 
realize the challenges that Russia had in getting their oil and getting 
their crops and their commodities out to a warm water port. Crimea is 
vitally important to their economy and militarily as well.
  I think that is another great point and another great question as 
well. What is the end goal in Ukraine? I don't think America has been 
given the answer to that. Again, I just think back to Vietnam and being 
a young child, listening to Walter Cronkite on ``The Nightly News,'' 
and my parents asking that same question: What is the goal? What are we 
trying to do in Vietnam? Where are we going with this?
  And as we saw, my goodness, the Agent Orange and all the atrocities 
that were coming out of Vietnam. Our soldiers were vilified. Americans 
didn't welcome them back home. It was a horrible time in America. And I 
think there was never a clear purpose of what the end game was in 
Vietnam. Let's don't repeat that same mistake.
  Next: What are we doing to ensure that Europe is doing their part as 
well?
  Listen, it is almost impossible for me to understand exactly how much 
Europe has committed and then actually followed through with. In my 
humble opinion, they have made some very bravado claims that they are 
going to do, and I don't think they have adequately followed up on it 
yet.
  I am still waiting for a report that I can trust and verify that 
Europe is doing their part. I do think that they should be more 
motivated than we are to secure the situation there. They are willing 
to help, but once again, I think it is about priorities for me. Let's 
secure our own borders first.
  Next question: Is there corruption happening in Ukraine?
  Look, I think that there is, unfortunately. I think that there is 
corruption in Ukraine. The largest telecom company in Ukraine is being 
threatened to be nationalized by Zelenskyy. Let me say that again. 
Zelenskyy is threatening to nationalize the largest telecom company in 
Ukraine.
  This particular company is on NASDAQ--American ownership, many 
Americans have ownership on this stock as well. It is sitting on a fair 
amount of cash, and the plan was when this war settled, that they would 
go back and reinvest that cash and reinvest that money through the 
telecom to help Ukraine's economy recover. But it appears to me that 
President Zelenskyy wants that cash.

[[Page S897]]

  And just think what he can do from a political standpoint. It would 
be like if the White House could control two or three of the largest 
telecom companies in America; what an unfair advantage that is to other 
political parties as well. So there is political issues with it, as 
well as I think economic issues, and for Zelenskyy to threaten 
Americans, to threaten our leadership that if we don't give him the $60 
billion, he is going to nationalize this American company, I think is 
hitting below the belt. It is not right. It is not fair. I don't like 
to be threatened. Americans don't like to be threatened.
  So those are some of the questions that folks back home in Kansas 
have asked us. I hope we have adequately addressed them.
  What time I have got left, Mr. President, I think I will talk about 
being a patriot, what it means to be a patriot. And I would just ask 
the folks in the room, Are you a patriot? or when did you become a 
patriot? And maybe if I could, I would just like to share my moment 
when I became a patriot.
  My wife and I got married about 2 weeks before medical school 
started. A year and a half later, in the second year of medical school, 
we had our firstborn. We brought her home to a little studio apartment. 
I took my desk and made a little spot for a crib for her. My wife was 
going to give up her job to take care of the baby, which I was so 
forever grateful for the sacrifices that moms make. And already, we 
were having a rough time making ends meet.
  So I knew I needed to do something economically. I said, This is no 
way to take care of a family. It was one of those moments when I was 
considering what I needed to do. I thought about my forefathers. My dad 
had served in the military. My brother had served. As a matter of fact, 
going back to the Civil War, every generation in my family had somebody 
who had served in the military. Four grandfathers of my grandparents 
served in the Union Army, a few gave their life, made the ultimate 
sacrifice preserving the Union.
  My wife had an uncle who served in World War I, suffered from nerve 
gas exposure in the Argonne Forest. Two of my dad's uncles were part of 
the D-day invasion. My dad served; my brother served; and I served, and 
my son served. Anyway, in that moment, I said, This is what I need to 
do; I need to go in the military, rather than borrow money. I wanted to 
check that box as well. So my wife and I signed up, and officer's basic 
training was in Fort Belvoir, VA, just 30 minutes from where we are 
standing today.
  Most people don't take their wife and newborn with them to basic 
training, but we decided to do that. And even though my wife stayed in 
a different place than I did, I was so glad that she got to come. Every 
spare moment that we had, though, we enriched ourselves in the many 
cultural opportunities that our Nation's Capital gives us.
  We spent a day at Monticello. We spent a day at Mount Vernon. We 
spent a day going through the National History Museum, spending days on 
end at all the different Smithsonians on the Nation's Mall, sucking up 
the history, the nectar of life in this great country, stopping at each 
one of the monuments and reading and learning and going on tours about 
the sacrifices that our forefathers, our Founding Fathers had done for 
all of us.
  Now, as a pre-med student--biochemistry, nuclear engineering--I 
didn't get to spend much time on history, so it was truly a great 
awakening for me. But sometime in that process that summer, between 
taking an oath to defend the Constitution and learning all this 
information about our Nation's history, I became a real patriot, 
dedicating myself to make sure I leave this country better for the next 
generation.
  And as I look at legislation like this--complicated legislation. My 
goodness, trying to do something in Ukraine, something in Israel, in 
Taiwan, in humanitarian efforts, and to think that we have left behind 
this opportunity to secure our border, it is very troubling to me--
horribly troubling to me--that we squandered this once in a generation 
opportunity to fix this problem.
  And that is why I have been willing to go forward. I wanted to go 
back and work. Let's work on this border security issue until we get it 
right, and then we can move on to this, but that opportunity was not 
afforded us, and here we are today.
  But as a patriot, I stand before you and I stand before the people of 
America saying the right thing to do would be to secure our border 
first. There is going to be those who today and tomorrow judge us and 
say that I am in the wrong, but it will take decades. It is going to 
take decades for history to figure out who is right here and who is 
wrong here. And as I have said before, I may be wrong on Ukraine, but I 
am darn secure and darn confident that securing the border should be 
our top priority right now. It is our No. 1, most immediate threat to 
our national security.
  So as this debate concludes, it is with an ill heart that I will go 
home having lost this battle, and Americans are not going to understand 
that. But they are going to hold people accountable. Americans are 
going to hold people accountable that chose to move on from border 
security and fund foreign nations before we took care of our own homes.
  I can promise the Presiding Officer that I am always going to be a 
patriot first.
  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.


                 Congratulating the Kansas City Chiefs

  Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I am here tonight to talk about the 
foreign aid supplemental that is the pending business on this floor, 
but before I do that, I have to take a moment of personal privilege, if 
my colleagues will allow me, in light of recent events, just to say a 
word about the Kansas City Chiefs, which last night, in dramatic 
fashion, won their third Super Bowl in the last 5 years. Now, as a 
lifelong Kansas City fan, it is an incredible privilege to get to 
congratulate the Chiefs again on this floor just as I did last year.
  For those who missed the game, the Chiefs beat the 49ers in a 
terrific, terrific game, with a final score of 25 to 22, in an overtime 
thriller. It is only the second time, I think, in Super Bowl history 
that a Super Bowl has gone into overtime. Yet again, the Chiefs came 
back from a double-digit deficit. They were down 10 points at one point 
in the first half, coming back to win the game again by a score of 25 
to 22.
  This is the first time in 19 years now that a team has won back-to-
back Super Bowls. Already, we in the Kansas City area and Chiefs 
Kingdom are ready for a three-peat as we gear up for next season.
  I just want to call out a few folks who had particularly outstanding 
performances.
  I have to start by highlighting my good friend Harrison Butker, the 
Kansas City Chief's stellar kicker and best kicker in the league. 
Harrison, last night, set a new Super Bowl record with a 57-yard field 
goal at the end of the first half. He scored more than half of the 
team's total points, being 4 for 4 in field goal attempts and, of 
course, 1 for 1 in his point-after attempts. He made a crucial field 
goal there at the end of the fourth quarter that tied the score and 
sent the game into overtime.
  This Super Bowl performance of his underscores a phenomenal season in 
which he was perfect in the postseason and missed only two field goals 
the entire regular season. I will just say that what happened last 
night was typical of Harrison's performance the entire season in terms 
of scoring points for this team. He has truly been an outstanding, 
outstanding, outstanding player this season and absolutely key to this 
team.
  Of course, what can you say about Patrick Mahomes, the best 
quarterback in the league, the best quarterback of all time?
  Andy Reid--another phenomenal coaching game. His end game adjustments 
were absolutely unbelievable.
  A terrific defensive play from Steve Spagnuolo's unit and everybody 
involved.
  Tight end Travis Kelce led the team in receiving last night--9 
receptions for 93 yards.
  Pacheco rushed 18 times for 59 yards, had 6 receptions for 33 yards.
  Mahomes--34 of 46 pass attempts, 333 yards, rushed nine times for 66 
yards and, of course, was named the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player. 
That makes him only the third player to have won that honor three 
times, joining Tom Brady and the great Joe Montana.

[[Page S898]]

  This was a terrific, terrific game, and I hope that we will soon pass 
a resolution here on the floor to honor the Chiefs' terrific victory 
and to prepare for what I think will be its terrific season next 
season.
  Let me just say two more things on this score just personally.
  First, to Clark and Tavia and to their three kids, thank you for your 
leadership. Thank you for putting your faith at the center of all that 
you do. You have made your faith the center of the family. You have 
made your faith the center of your organization, and it shows. The 
excellence that you have brought and have continued with this program 
in Kansas City, with the organization that your family has built, that 
you have carried on, the legacy that you have passed along, is truly 
incredible.
  So thank you, Clark and Tavia. Thank you for your friendship. Thank 
you for your leadership. Thank you for what you have done for this 
organization.
  On a personal note to Harrison Butker and Isabelle, congratulations. 
Thank you for your bold witness, for your faith. Thank you for the way 
that you lead your lives. Thank you for being a terrific ambassador, 
Harrison, and terrific ambassadors as a couple for the Kansas City 
Chiefs, for Kansas City, for the region, but most of all, for your 
faith and for the faith we have in common. It is an honor to get to 
call you a friend. It is an honor to get to see you play.
  This was such a terrific, terrific game last night, such a fantastic 
game. Congratulations to all the Chiefs.
  Senator Marshall and I and others have offered a resolution honoring 
the team, which I hope will pass the Senate with unanimous consent. We 
look forward to sharing that with all of the team members, Andy Reid, 
Clark and Tavia, as well as the entire State of Missouri.
  Since my good friend Senator Marshall is on the floor, I will just 
say that we in Kansas City of Missouri--you know, the Chiefs in 
Missouri football team--are so proud to have the Chiefs in Missouri, 
but, hey, we welcome fans from Kansas and all around the country. So it 
is a great day for Missouri but also for Chiefs' fans everywhere, and 
you are sure welcome to cheer for them in the great State of Kansas as 
well. So thank you for that.
  I thank the Presiding Officer for indulging me in making those 
remarks and in honoring this terrific football team.
  I will just say, as a guy who grew up--as a young guy watching the 
Chiefs play, I still remember exactly where I was--maybe Senator 
Marshall can relate to this--when Joe Montana took the Chiefs to the 
AFC Championship game. Montana played for the Chiefs, of course, for 3 
years toward the end of his career. I still remember right where I was 
while watching Montana in that first season at the AFC Championship 
game. It was the farthest the Chiefs had ever gotten in my lifetime. We 
lost that game, unfortunately. But I was sitting in a Maid-Right in 
Lexington, MO, where I grew up, watching them on a little TV that was 
kind of up in the corner there, and I thought to myself, man, it 
doesn't get better than this. But, as we found out, it does get better 
than that. It gets better than just going to the AFC Championship game. 
It gets better when you win the AFC Championship game and when you win 
the Super Bowl year after year after year.
  Congratulations to the Chiefs and the dynasty that they now have 
created in the National Football League, and I think they are just 
getting started.


                                H.R. 815

  Mr. President, on a more serious note, in turning now to the topic of 
conversation that is before us on the floor tonight, we are considering 
the national security supplemental, and it is absolutely true that 
America faces no shortage of threats to our national security.
  Our own borders, which, to begin with, as we sit here and speak 
tonight, are wide open. The number of border crossings continues at 
alltime highs. There were, in fiscal year 2023, 860,000 illegal ``got-
aways'' and 302,000 encounters with illegal aliens in December of this 
last year alone. That is an alltime high for a single month. The number 
of Chinese migrants at the southwest border jumped more than tenfold, 
from 2,176 in fiscal year 2022 to 24,314 in fiscal year 2023. CBS News 
reports today that migrants in Mexico have made 64 million requests--64 
million requests--to enter the United States using the CBP One app. 
That is an app that the Federal Government developed with your tax 
dollars for the phone that illegal immigrants can now use to get 
concierge service to cross the border. There are 64 million illegal 
immigrants who have asked to set up appointments to enter the United 
States using this app. I laugh, but it is not funny. It is not funny at 
all. It is deadly serious. The threat across our southern border is 
deadly serious.
  The threats that we face on all sides across the world are deadly 
serious. China--Imperial China--is now twice as powerful relative to 
the United States as the Soviet Union was at its peak, and China 
explicitly seeks to dominate the world's largest economic area and to 
displace this country as a global power. That would have monumental, 
unprecedented implications for America's interests, and we cannot allow 
that to happen.
  But right now we are considering a so-called security supplemental 
that puts those pressing concerns last, not first, and that does not do 
anything for our border at all. In fact, we were first served up a so-
called border bill that would have made the problem worse not better--a 
border bill that I think of as the full employment act for illegal 
aliens.
  The border bill, so-called, that was before this Chamber a week ago--
of that border bill, its central feature, from my point of view, was to 
give illegal aliens already in the country expedited work permits--
expedited work permits now to millions of illegals, almost none of whom 
will ultimately qualify to remain here permanently in the country, 
including for asylum claims. Over 80 percent of asylum claims fail, we 
know, statistically. Yet that bill would have given those illegal 
aliens here expedited work permits to go enter our labor force right 
now.
  We are looking at the flatlining of wages in this country for working 
people. Blue-collar workers, A, are having trouble finding a job, and 
B, haven't seen a real rise in their wages in years. Over the last 30 
years, blue-collar wages have declined. Yet the solution of this body 
would be to create even more cheap labor in this country?
  We know why the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Wall Street love that 
bill. It is a cheap labor bill. They love cheap labor. Their first 
preference would be to have overseas cheap labor, but if they can't get 
that, then why not subject Americans and those who are here illegally 
to even more illegal cheap labor? It makes absolutely no sense at all, 
none at all, which is why I voted against it. Yet that was what we were 
offered as a solution to the border.
  As to a solution to China, this body has dragged its feet and 
neglected its responsibilities toward China for years--one is tempted 
to say decades--and the current supplemental does nothing meaningful in 
that regard. In fact, the focus is entirely almost--certainly heavily--
on Ukraine, more money for Ukraine. We have spent $115 billion almost 
in Ukraine so far. This bill would commit tens of billions more--and to 
what end?
  Let me just offer a contrast. Not long ago, I was on this floor, 
discussing the need--discussing the cries--for justice for Americans in 
my State, in Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming, Tennessee, 
Kentucky, and Alaska. These are Americans who have been exposed to 
nuclear radiation or radioactive waste by their own government that 
goes back decades.
  In my State, the city of St. Louis was used as a uranium processing 
facility at the very beginning of the Oppenheimer project, the 
Manhattan Project. We have all learned about this in greater detail 
thanks to that movie, but have we yet learned about the brave men and 
women in this country who gave their health and, in many instances, 
yes, their lives to see that project come to fruition? Well, we haven't 
when it comes to the brave men and women of Missouri. I can tell you 
that.
  St. Louis was a secret uranium processing site for years. When the 
Federal Government shut down its uranium processing work in St. Louis, 
what did it do? Did it clean up the uranium? Did

[[Page S899]]

it clean up the nuclear waste? No, it didn't. Here is what it did: It 
put the waste into canisters--metal canisters, unsecured--and set them 
out in open parking lots and other facilities, exposed to the 
elements--exposed to the wind and the rain and the weather--for years 
on end and then watched as those metal drums leaked nuclear waste right 
out of the drums and right down into the soil and right into the water, 
right into a creek--Coldwater Creek is its name--that runs through the 
greater St. Louis area, from the center of the city out into the 
suburbs.
  Just as this was happening in the 1950s into the 1960s, what was 
happening to those suburbs? Well, people were moving out of city 
centers. They were moving to the suburbs, and they were building homes. 
Where were they building their homes? It was along this beautiful, 
picturesque creek that just so happens to have been contaminated from 
the fifties forward with nuclear waste. Where did the waste come from? 
From the Federal Government.
  But that wasn't the only place in St. Louis that was contaminated, 
no. The Federal Government also then decided: Do you know what? Maybe a 
way to get rid of this would be to just dump all of the waste in a 
public landfill.
  So that is what they did. They took the waste, some of it, to a 
public landfill--without any controls, without any appropriate cleanup, 
and by the way, without informing the public--and they dumped it into 
the landfill, along with everything else that was there, taking no 
precautions and exercising no appropriate cleanup.
  They dumped it in another location called Latty Avenue, and then 
there was yet another location called Weldon Spring, such that there 
are now multiple locations all of these years later in the city of St. 
Louis.
  We are talking now about, in just one metropolitan area in this 
country, there are multiple locations where nuclear waste has been 
dumped into the soil, dumped into the water, exposing people--into the 
air, and for 50-plus years, it has been going on. It continues as I 
stand tonight on this floor--because how much of it has been cleaned 
up? None of it. Has the creek been cleaned up? No. Has the landfill 
been cleaned up? No. Has the second landfill at Weldon Spring been 
cleaned up? No. Has Latty Avenue appropriately been cleaned up? No. No, 
it has not.
  But what has happened is generations of residents in my State--in St. 
Louis and then in St. Charles--have played in that creek, and they have 
gone to those schools. They have been exposed repeatedly to this 
nuclear radiation and waste, and they have developed cancers of many 
and various kinds such that we lead the Nation now, in St. Louis 
County, in breast cancer and in various childhood cancers. It is not 
natural, Mr. President. There is nothing normal about it. It is because 
of what the Federal Government has done and done for decades.

  Why do I mention it? Well, because the program that this government 
set up some years ago to compensate those Americans who have been 
exposed by their government to nuclear radiation is about to expire, 
and just a few months ago, I secured the approval of this body to renew 
it.
  We passed here on the floor of this body, with a strong bipartisan 
vote, a renewal measure to make good on our promise to those Americans 
who have been exposed to nuclear radiation by their government, who 
have grown ill because of nuclear radiation by their government, who 
have died because of nuclear radiation by their government, to make 
good on our promise to help them. We passed it. We also included in 
that legislation relief for the people of St. Louis and St. Charles and 
others in Missouri, relief for people of New Mexico and Arizona and 
Utah and others who were downwind of these tests that we saw so vividly 
portrayed in the ``Oppenheimer'' movie and elsewhere.
  Then what happened, Mr. President? I will tell you what happened. The 
National Defense Authorization Act--the Defense bill--went to 
conference, and there, despite the strong bipartisan vote on this 
floor, it was removed in a backroom deal. Senator McConnell and others 
led the charge to remove this provision.
  What was the rationale? What were we told? Why was it that nuclear 
radiation victims from Missouri to Kentucky, to Tennessee, to Alaska 
cannot be compensated, according to so-called leadership? What was the 
rationale, Mr. President?
  I remember it vividly. I heard it. It rings in my ears every day. The 
rationale is, we don't have the money. The rationale is, it is too 
expensive to do right by the American people who have suffered and died 
because of their government's nuclear radiation program. The rationale 
was, we can't possibly afford it. That was the rationale.
  Now, lo and behold, I turn, Mr. President, to this bill before us, 
and I find we seem to have unlimited sums of money when it comes to 
foreign wars. Good Lord, when it comes to funding the machinery of war, 
we have money; we have money; we have money that we couldn't possibly 
dream of. We can run the presses indefinitely if it is going to go 
overseas, if we are going to be paying foreign governments. Why, we 
have got enough money apparently to send $8 billion direct to the 
treasury of Ukraine. My goodness, we have enough money to make hundreds 
of millions of dollars of our taxpayer funds available to the private 
sector in Ukraine. We are now literally funding their businesses, their 
banks--Lord knows what. We have got money without end. We have got 
enough money to pay for bureaucrats' salaries. We have got enough to 
pay for Ukrainian Government officials' pensions.
  We have got enough for so-called humanitarian aid that gets funneled 
away from, siphoned off into any manner of corrupt uses. We won't know 
because we don't have a special inspector general to oversee this 
money, but that is a different story. Oh, no, we have got plenty of 
money.
  I have listened carefully--carefully--to colleague after colleague of 
mine come to this floor, stand where I am now, and say: It is so 
important that we spend this money on these overseas wars. We must 
spend the money. If we don't spend this money now, why, it may cost us 
more money in the future. No, it is imperative--it is imperative--that 
we spend this money.
  Meanwhile, these same people turn to the citizens of Missouri and 
say: You are not worth a dime. They say: You can't have a penny. They 
turn to the residents of Kentucky and Tennessee and Alaska and New 
Mexico and Arizona and Utah and Texas, and they say: We don't care that 
you were poisoned; we don't have a dime for you. We have unlimited 
money for Ukraine. We are going to rebuild the borders of Ukraine--that 
is in this bill--but we don't have anything for you.
  We are probably, for all I know, paying for radiation exposure 
compensation for Ukrainians in this bill. We very well could be, Mr. 
President. We will never know because there will never be an 
accounting. But the contrast strikes me as not only stark, it strikes 
me as absurd. It strikes me as absurd. It is worse than that; it 
strikes me as grossly unjust.
  Listen, if you want to give money to overseas military operations, I 
think you are making a mistake when it comes to Ukraine. I think doing 
it without oversight is a serious mistake. I think doing it in a way 
that seriously harms our position in the Pacific, which is our most 
important foreign policy challenge, is a serious mistake. I think doing 
it before we secure our own border is a serious mistake.
  But given all of that, if you want to give money to foreign wars in 
Ukraine, that is one thing, but to turn around and say we have plenty 
of money for that endeavor; we have unlimited sums of money for that 
endeavor, but we have nothing for the people in the United States of 
America; we have nothing for those who are sick and dying of cancer 
because of their government's action--to say that, Mr. President, is 
not only a juxtaposition but strikes the mind to say that is manifestly 
unjust, to say that is wrong, to say that cannot be sustained, Mr. 
President, to say that is a scar on the conscience of this body.
  It cannot be that we have unlimited sums of cash for foreign wars but 
we have nothing for the needs of our own people whom our own government 
has hurt and poisoned. That cannot be true in this country. It cannot 
be, which is why I will soon demand again that this body vote to make 
good on this government's commitment to help those whom its government 
has poisoned.
  But I hope and expect that when that time soon comes, we will not 
hear talk

[[Page S900]]

about how expensive it is to clean up after the Federal Government, how 
expensive it is for all of these Americans--hundreds of thousands of 
them who have been poisoned by the government--how expensive it is for 
them, after we have been treated to speech after speech, hour upon 
hour, day upon day, on just how important it is to spend this money on 
Ukraine. If it is good enough for the Ukrainians, surely it is good 
enough for the American people. Surely, Mr. President, it is good 
enough for the American people.
  What of those in East Palestine? Here we are a year now since the 
train derailments, the explosions, the chemical spill in that State. It 
is not just, of course, the residents right there, as devastating as it 
was for East Palestine, but that those chemical agents spilled into the 
waterways, eventually meeting up with the Mississippi, carrying those 
toxic agents all the way down, including to my State of Missouri, 
affecting everybody who lives along the river and at the greater 
watershed area.
  I just note again, Mr. President, what is it that this body has seen 
fit to do for the residents of East Palestine? Has that crisis been 
addressed? Has that spill been cleaned up? Has our river been cleaned? 
No. Have we voted on a railway safety bill? No. No. We haven't lifted a 
finger--this body hasn't--to do anything to help the residents of East 
Palestine or anybody else downstream from that crisis. Certainly, the 
people of Missouri haven't gotten an ounce of relief--nothing. Nothing. 
But we have unlimited time, unlimited resources, and unlimited rhetoric 
for our foreign wars.

  There is a moral incongruity here that cannot be sustained. It cannot 
be that the American people will constantly be asked to be fodder for 
our foreign wars and adventures, while their needs are overlooked, 
overshadowed, and put to one side. It is not sustainable. It is not 
right.
  Whether we are talking about St. Louis or St. Charles, MO, or East 
Palestine, or any other State in this Nation, it is not right that this 
body's priority is time and again overseas wars, the machinery of war, 
foreign adventurism, and, of course, let's not forget the priorities of 
Wall Street. Let's not forget that. Right. Who is it that always gets 
paid?
  In the national Defense bill, we were told over and over that there 
is just no money available for Americans poisoned by their government, 
but I noticed that we had $1 trillion of funds available for defense 
contractors. Wall Street always gets paid. The defense contractors 
always get paid. And this body always hops to do their bidding. I have 
seen it over and over in my short time in the Senate. It doesn't take 
long, if you are paying attention, to see who really calls the shots 
around here. The big corporations, the defense contractors, the Wall 
Street banks--they call the shots. Both parties--let's be honest. That 
is why we call it the uniparty, because at the end of the day, there is 
one set of interests that play the tune and that call the shots, and 
they are the ones who get paid.
  The American people have to take a back seat to that. If the working 
people of my State and Ohio have to get nothing, then that is just how 
it is. But Wall Street will certainly get paid. The defense contractors 
will certainly get paid. They will certainly have their way. And so 
here we are again.
  I am sure they love this bill. They love this bill, which makes me 
think, Mr. President, maybe one way to help clear the eyes and focus 
the mind on this body is, maybe we ought to pass a law that says that 
no Member of Congress can hold stock or trade stock in corporations 
that have contracts with the defense industry. Wouldn't it change 
things around here if no Member of Congress could turn a profit on the 
machinery of war? My goodness, what a difference that would make. My 
goodness, how the debates in this Chamber would change. My goodness, 
might it be, Heaven forbid, that Members might ask themselves, what 
should we do for the workers of this country as opposed to the defense 
contractors who are making hand-over-fist money in Ukraine?
  I keep hearing all this talk about how this bill is really all about 
renewing our industrial base. What that really means is it is about 
sending more money to defense contractors. They have already gotten 
paid once this year. Now they are going to get paid again and I am sure 
again and again and again. But mark my words, in just a few weeks' 
time, we will be hearing about how we have no funds--no funds--for 
anybody who is a victim of nuclear radiation, no funds to do anything 
for East Palestine, no funds to clean up any of the disasters this 
government has created. No, we have no money. We have no money. It has 
all gone to Ukraine.
  I think that the moral contrast is clear, and all I can say is, I 
don't think it is lost on the American people, who want to see a 
Congress that actually puts their interests first, to see a Congress 
that actually invests in them ahead of all others, to see a Congress 
that says: If there is going to be a conflict between what we can 
afford to do overseas and at home, we are going to prioritize home. If 
it is between rebuilding another nation or rebuilding this one, we are 
going to rebuild this one. If it is between securing another nation's 
borders or our own, we are going to secure our own. But at the very 
least, if we are going to invest in all of these foreign wars, we are 
at least going to take care of our people in this country--at the very 
least.
  Mr. President, I think it is not lost on them, which is why here we 
are passing this bill probably in the dead of night--another exercise 
in this body's monumental detachment, disconnect, and, frankly, 
contempt for the American people.
  I will be voting no, Mr. President, but I will be here to stand and 
speak for and say yes to the people of my State and other States around 
this Nation who want to be prioritized, who want to be heard, who want 
to be put first by their government.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Smith). The Senator from North Carolina.
  Mr. BUDD. Madam President, we meet this week at a critical time for 
our country and for our world. There are wars raging in Europe and the 
Middle East.
  China poses a growing threat to the United States and our interests 
in the Indo-Pacific, and we are currently facing the worst border 
crisis in U.S. history. We are feeling the consequences of this crisis 
all over the country.
  In New York City, we witnessed illegal aliens attack members of law 
enforcement and then brazenly flaunt obscene gestures on camera to all 
of America. In Boston, an illegal alien who crossed the border in 
December 2022 was arrested by ICE after raping a handicapped citizen. 
Pick your city. Pick your State.
  In my home State of North Carolina, we have seen a 22-percent 
increase in drug overdose deaths--the highest level ever recorded. This 
is primarily due to deadly fentanyl that was produced in China and then 
transported into our country through an open southern border on 
President Biden's watch.
  Police departments from Charlotte to Raleigh have uncovered tens of 
thousands of pounds of fentanyl, enough to kill every man, woman, and 
child not just in my home State of North Carolina but in this whole 
country.
  Now, in order to tackle the challenges both at home and abroad, the 
Senate and the White House attempted to craft an agreement to deal with 
this border crisis.
  The Senator, my friend and colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford, 
did the best he could considering the ideologies of those he was 
negotiating with. But unfortunately, Senate Democrats are still 
beholden to progressive ideologies and ideologues who believe in open 
borders.
  Now, this term ``progressive'' is a perversion of the term 
``progress,'' isn't it? Especially since it leads the other side of the 
aisle down a path of chaos and tragedy. For example, President Biden 
has taken 94 Executive actions that transformed the border from a place 
of relative security to a place of lawlessness. That might be 
progressive, but, friends, that ain't progress.
  It might be progressive, but it is not progress to live in a nation 
where children die of accidental fentanyl overdoses before they even 
learn to drive a car. It might be progressive, but it is not progress 
to allow terrorists, cartel members, and human traffickers to roam 
freely in communities around this country.
  But when it comes to our side's recent history, the Republican House

[[Page S901]]

acted. They passed H.R. 2. But at the end of the day, it is Democrats 
who refuse to agree to any provisions that would meaningfully secure 
our border.
  At the same time, the threats we face on the world stage demand our 
attention as well.
  We have an opportunity to rebuild the arsenal of democracy, make 
significant investments in our national defense, and prepare ourselves 
for the threat from the Chinese Communist Party. Right now, our defense 
supply lines are brittle. Our manufacturing base is not prepared for 
future conflict, and it has to be modernized.
  Our allies and our partners, like Israel and Taiwan, need our help--
especially our friends in Israel. They are in a fight for survival. We 
need to send them the aid they need to finish the job and to free the 
remaining hostages, one of whom is a North Carolinian.
  At the same time, we should share Israel's military objectives: to 
destroy Hamas, to demilitarize Gaza, and to deradicalize the 
Palestinian population.
  We don't need President Biden's virtue signaling to a Democrat base 
that is increasingly becoming pro-Hamas. We need to let our allies in 
Israel and around the world know that we are on their side and that our 
resolve is, indeed, strong.
  If we let our own defense atrophy and we leave our allies high and 
dry, forces of evil and instability will be even more emboldened, and 
our world will become even more dangerous.
  Remember, it is American strength that deters aggression, and it is 
weakness that provokes it. But in order to be a strong nation, we first 
have to be strong right here at home. We must secure our own border 
before we can help other countries protect theirs. I believe that this 
position is reasonable, and I am going to mention a quick example to 
make my point.
  On one of my recent telephone townhalls, I asked a poll question to 
thousands of people who were on the call. I asked: If you could be 
assured that the southern border was secure, then would you support 
sending support to our allies and our partners?
  I will say that again.
  If you could be assured that the southern border was secure, would 
you then support sending support to our allies and our partners?
  Roughly two-thirds of the respondents said yes. I bet it is the same 
in other States around this country. Most folks aren't opposed to 
helping our friends; they just think we need to take care of our 
country first. And ``America First'' doesn't have to mean ``America 
Only.'' But as I watch the process play out here in this Chamber, I 
can't blame folks back home who really feel frustrated.
  The Senate's initial deal, which at least attempted to address the 
border crisis, was then replaced with a bill with zero border 
provisions at all, and to date, there has not been a full amendment 
process, as was promised.
  For example, I think it would be outrageous to allow a single U.S. 
taxpayer dollar to flow to Gaza while Hamas terrorists hold American 
citizens hostages. This amendment and many others are not even going to 
be considered.
  The truth is that this entire process is not working. The only viable 
path forward is for Congress to force President Biden to get serious 
about border security and then for the American people to see the 
situation at the border start to get better. Until that happens, we 
find ourselves locked in a stalemate as the world burns.
  We can't accept this. Yes, we want to help our allies and our 
partners, but to keep our Nation strong, we must always put America 
first.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.
  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, what we have here is a ``Ukraine First'' 
bill. This bill was never really about securing our border but about 
securing another country's border. What we have here is a failure of 
the elites of Washington on both sides of the aisle--the leadership of 
the Democratic Party, the leadership of the Republican Party--what we 
have here is a failure of these elites to understand that the American 
people want to put America first.
  Sixty-one percent of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck, and 
they want to put Ukraine first. I want you to talk to your constituents 
at home, the ones who live paycheck to paycheck, and tell them why you 
are shipping $60 billion to Ukraine. This will be $170 billion. We have 
never before in the history of the United States flooded so much money 
into another country.
  Sixty-one percent of our country lives paycheck to paycheck. Eight 
out of 10 families who make $50,000 or less won't have enough money to 
pay their bills in 2 weeks if their check doesn't come. If they have 
one interruption in their family, one thing that sets them back, one 
unexpected expense, they won't have enough money to pay their bills, 
and you want to put Ukraine first.
  This is why the Democratic Party is losing the working man. This is 
why the Republicans have become the party of the working class. This is 
why many, if not most, members of the unions are now looking at 
Republicans--because we support the working man and we support the 
working women of America, and we recognize that they do not want to 
send their hard-earned money and taxes halfway across the world.
  What does their money go for? Do we know what they are doing with 
their money in Ukraine? Well, we do know that the money went to fund 
six fashion brands to go to the Paris fashion show. We do know that it 
is funding small businesses to sell ladies' handbags. We do know that 
it is paying for the salaries of 57,000 first responders. What about 
the first responders in our country? What about the people who get in 
an ambulance and have a $35,000 bill in our country? What about 
tackling the problems of America first? Instead, this bill is a 
``Ukraine First'' bill. It is a ``Ukraine First'' policy.
  According to the ``Ukraine First'' party, which includes elites of 
both parties, war is good; war is useful; war profits make us stronger. 
It sounds a bit Orwellian. They say that war profits will build the 
defense industrial base. This is the part they used to say quietly. 
They used to whisper this. They used to never say it out loud, that war 
profits fund the defense industrial base. And by golly, we are going to 
be stronger the more war profits there are. According to the ``Ukraine 
First'' party, war is not so bad. More profits make us stronger.
  Lost in this reprehensible argument is any sense of grief over the 
500,000 dead, for the mothers and fathers weeping graveside. Little 
sense of grief, little sense of understanding that supporting and 
lauding grief is supporting and lauding the death of war. Missing from 
the ``war profits are good'' argument is any sense of compassion for 
the thousands of lives that will yet be lost by the prolongation of 
this war.
  If military contracts for 100,000 rifles are good, what about 1 
million rifles? If military contracts for 1,000 tanks are good, what 
about 1 million tanks? If military contracts for 500 bombs are good, 
what about military contracts for 5,000 bombs?
  Missing from the argument that war profit is good, that the more 
armaments we sell, the better, is compassion for the deaths that we are 
talking about, the prolongation of war.
  You know, war doesn't end typically in victory. Almost all wars end 
in negotiated settlement. The longer there are unlimited war profits, 
the longer there are unlimited weapons being sent to Ukraine, the 
longer the war goes on, the more people who die.
  This is a grinder. It is a meat grinder over there. There are whole 
towns without young men.
  Do I think Russia is in the wrong? Of course they are. Are they the 
aggressor? Of course they are. Do I have sympathy for Ukraine? 
Absolutely. But we also are now funneling money to a country that has 
no elections. They have canceled their Presidential elections. They 
have suppressed speech. They have banned certain opposition parties. 
They have banned certain opposition press. They have banned officials 
of opposition religion.
  Now, this should bother people because it is said that American might 
and foreign aid is to express our power and our values. Are our values 
no elections? Are our values suppressing speech?
  What has become confusing even in our country is the Democratic Party 
has become the party of censorship. They are the party that agrees that 
the Biden administration is OK to meet

[[Page S902]]

with the FBI, to meet with Homeland Security, and to meet in the 
offices of Twitter, meet in the offices of Facebook. They suppressed 
for over a year anybody who is willing to say that it looks like the 
virus came from a lab in Wuhan. That was suppressed for over a year not 
just by private business but by the government, by the Biden 
administration meeting the FBI, Homeland Security, meeting with the 
tech companies. So it doesn't surprise me that they don't care too 
much; just get the honey out the door even though, in Ukraine, they are 
living under a regime where speech has been suppressed.
  What the ``American Firsters,'' what the ``Ukraine Firsters'' are 
really arguing for is an ``America Last'' policy. They are really 
arguing for a longer, bigger, more deadly war because it expands the 
profits of the defense industrial base. How despicable. How absolutely 
disgusting. They are saying the quiet part out loud. They are OK with 
war. The longer the war, the more profits, the stronger the American 
defense base.
  It is a circular argument: We are not sending the money to Ukraine; 
it is coming right back. It is coming back in the form of profits to 
the American arms merchants. It is OK. We are really not going to lose 
$170 billion because it is coming back in profits. We will make more 
bombs.
  What ever happened to the progressive left? Wasn't it great when 
there were people on the left who actually were progressive on things 
such as war? How absolutely disgusting to argue that war profits are a 
benefit, a benefit that somehow overshadows the awful specter of war's 
death and carnage.

  The amount of money going to Ukraine in this bill is more than we 
spend on the entire Marine Corps. Think about it. We are going to send 
to Ukraine more money than we spend on our own Marine Corps. This is a 
bill about ``Ukraine First.'' This is a bill that makes us weaker.
  There is no money to give to Ukraine. It is not like we have a pot of 
money. There is no surplus. There is no rainy day fund. This money will 
be printed up or borrowed from China to send to Ukraine. It makes us 
weaker.
  Once the border bill failed and they decided that this wasn't really 
about the border, that this was about Ukraine's border, the ``America 
Firsters'' plowed on but with a more intellectually honest proposal: 
Nothing for America, everything for Ukraine. That is what this bill is: 
nothing for America; nothing to stop the invasion of nearly a million 
people across our southern border. They offered a border bill that 
would have said: Well, if we have an emergency. The emergency has 
already happened. Nearly a million people came in the last 2 months. 
That is the emergency. This is a bill that is ``Ukraine First'' and 
America last and ought to be defeated.
  I notice my colleague from Alabama is here. I reserve the remainder 
of time.
  Can you tell me how much time I have left?
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.
  Mr. PAUL. Thank you.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.
  Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam President, reclaiming my time, I come to the 
floor to sound the alarm, as a lot of my colleagues are, about the 
crisis at the southern border.
  I have been here over 3 years, and I have never seen this group try 
to do more for people out of our country than within our country. It is 
amazing.
  But this is the worst border crisis in our history. Since Joe Biden 
took office, there have been at least 8 million illegal crossings at 
our southern border--that we know of. This is in addition to the 2 
million ``got-aways.'' These are the illegals that we know of. The real 
number is probably much, much higher.
  Border crossings are at a record high. Deportations are at a record 
low. Why is this happening? You know, it didn't come out of the blue. 
This is a policy choice by President Biden and his allies here in 
Congress. We have been talking about this now for 3 years, asking why; 
and we have not gotten one good answer yet.
  Why is our border open? Joe Biden campaigned on opening up our 
borders. He campaigned on giving free healthcare to illegal aliens. So 
it is no surprise that he is keeping his promise.
  Since taking office, President Biden has taken 94 Executive actions 
related to immigration--94. We have the same laws on the books as we 
did when President Trump was in office, but President Trump secured the 
border. Joe Biden has opened our border more than it ever has been in 
the history of this country.
  Let's take a look at just a few of these Executive actions. First, 
President Biden stopped building the wall. In fact, he has been selling 
all parts of the wall for pennies on the dollar. I know people in 
Alabama who have bought stacks of steel that the American taxpayers 
paid in lots--$300,000 for these certain lots; $300,000 of American 
taxpayer money. These people now can go online at an auction and buy 
these lots for 10 cents on the dollar. I know people who have bought 
$300,000 lots for $30,000, just throwing taxpayer money down the drain. 
The same thing with razor wire, same thing for other parts of the wall 
that are being sold. They are just, basically, being given away. So we 
have been selling parts.
  President Biden--nobody told him to do it. He did it on his own. He 
chose to do it. President Biden got rid of President Trump's ``Remain 
in Mexico'' policy. That was the most effective policy we have seen in 
discouraging the abuse of our asylum system in years. I have been down 
the border several times. Border Patrol has told me time and time 
again: Finish the wall. That is the best thing we can do here. It won't 
stop it, but it will give us an opportunity to police the wall, make 
them come in through certain sections of the wall, and allow us to have 
some kind of border security.
  President Biden is currently suing the State of Texas to get them to 
stop securing the border. Let's think about that for a second. The 
President of the United States is suing a border State for stopping 
illegal immigrants from coming into our country. That doesn't sound 
quite right.
  I am proud that my State of Alabama has sent Texas hundreds of 
National Guardsmen to help them police Texas' borders. Unfortunately, 
President Biden is trying to stop them from doing that.
  As I mentioned, Joe Biden has essentially stopped all deportations 
right now--completely stopped it. He is not letting ICE do their job, 
immigration police. All these policies have led to this unprecedented 
crisis. They have also sent a message to the world: If you can get 
here, you can get in, and you will never, never have to leave. That 
message has been heard around the world loud and clear. There are 193 
countries around the world, and we know of 190 countries that have been 
accounted for coming across our southern borders. Illegal aliens have 
literally crossed our border wearing Joe Biden T-shirts. I would 
imagine the American taxpayers somehow paid for those.
  TV reporters have asked people coming across our borders why they 
came across. Time and time again, they say because President Biden 
invited them. That is on television. FOX News recorded one illegal in 
Tucson saying, ``I love you, Joe Biden. Thank you for everything.'' 
That migrant was not from Mexico. He was from Africa. People are coming 
from every corner of the globe. People are flying to Mexico and then 
walking across our border. The whole world knows that our border is 
open.
  These illegal aliens are criminals, drug traffickers. Just last year, 
nearly 500 people on the Terror Watchlist were caught trying to cross 
our border--500. You would think that would open somebody's eyes. You 
would think it would go all the way up Pennsylvania Avenue, but nobody 
seems to care.
  Just a few weeks ago, Christopher Wray, the FBI Director, said 
something bad is going to happen. This is Christopher Wray, the guy 
that runs our FBI, Federal Bureau of Investigation, said something is 
going to happen. He seemed like in his voice, he was begging somebody 
to do something. Nobody has. But just imagine, if 500 have been caught, 
how many more terrorists have come across the border unchecked. It 
doesn't take many; it only takes a few--9/11 was committed by 19 
foreigners here on visas--19. It only takes a small group to do 
terrible, terrible damage.
  But Americans are already dying because of the border crisis. We all 
know that. We are here to protect American

[[Page S903]]

citizens, but we are losing. We are losing that battle. More than 
300,000 Americans--300,000 Americans--have died from drug overdoses 
since Joe Biden took office--300,000. I met with a police chief of 
Montgomery, AL, not too long ago. He said: Coach, I had never heard the 
word ``fentanyl'' until 2 years ago; and now, it is 95 percent of what 
we have on our streets here in Montgomery, AL, killing young people. 
That is roughly half of the Americans killed in the Civil War--300,000. 
And that was the deadliest war in American history. The Governor of 
Oregon recently declared a state of emergency over fentanyl. The 
Governor is a Democrat. But she declared a state of emergency. Where 
does she think the fentanyl is coming from? She should demand that the 
people that represent the constituents in her State do something about 
what is happening.
  Federal law enforcement has said for years that almost all of these 
drugs are coming over the southern border. You don't have to take my 
word for it. That is what the DEA has said for years. Under Obama, 
under Trump, and under Biden, they said that most of the drugs that 
come into our country come across the southern border.
  Every day we fail to secure our border, another 150 Americans die 
from overdoses--150 a day--a planeload of people. This is in addition 
to Americans who are victims of crime committed by illegals. A few 
weeks ago, we saw the video of illegal aliens attacking New York City 
police officers. New York City is a sanctuary city. In fact, New York 
City is giving out free money on debit cards to illegal aliens as we 
speak. American citizens don't qualify for this money that the New York 
City government is giving out. If you are a citizen, you don't qualify 
for it. American citizens just have to pay for it.
  Yet New Yorkers wonder why there is a magnet pulling illegal aliens 
from all over the world into their city. You wonder why that is? New 
York State is also a sanctuary state. That was a policy choice by the 
current Governor. That means they do not cooperate with ICE. That is 
what a sanctuary city does. When an illegal commits a crime in New York 
or Philadelphia or Boston, they do not get sent to ICE when their jail 
time is up. It doesn't matter what crime they commit. My Democratic 
colleagues want these criminals to stay in our country because they 
don't want them to have to be sent home because that is exactly what 
ICE would do.
  In the New York case, these illegals who attacked the NYPD officers 
were jailed and then released without bail. They were let back on the 
street where they can continue to commit crimes against Americans. This 
case shows you how much Democrats care about our police officers. 
``Defund the police'' is all I have heard since I have been here. 
Really? They want police to go out and arrest the same people over and 
over again. Police are risking their lives every day. Every time they 
arrest someone, every time they kick in a door, they are risking their 
lives. Yet liberal judges and leftwing prosecutors will just let 
criminals go back on the street again, again, and again.
  Democrats like President Biden talk about a lot of compassion in our 
immigration system. We have to be compassionate. They don't have any 
compassion for Americans. They don't have compassion for Americans like 
Kate Steinle who was murdered in San Francisco. They don't have 
compassion for the woman who was raped by an illegal on a train 
recently in Philadelphia. They don't have compassion for the mother and 
daughter killed by a drunk driver who had allegedly been deported four 
times.
  When Americans get attacked or even killed by illegals, Democrats 
just see that as collateral damage. It is just the price of open 
borders. It is clearly more important to them to keep the border open 
than to bring justice to the victims.
  Protect American citizens. What an idea. Just weeks ago, the House 
voted on legislation to deport illegals who have been caught driving 
drunk--deport them.
  Madam President, 150 House Democrats voted against deporting anybody 
that was illegal caught driving drunk--150. The House also voted on 
legislation to deport illegals who committed Social Security fraud; 150 
House Democrats voted against it. Democrats won't even do the most 
basic things to secure our border--won't do anything.
  Now that it is an election year, obviously, now that we have gotten 
to this point and people have to have votes, we are supposed to believe 
that our Democratic colleagues have had a total change of heart--
because I have not seen anybody down there in 3 years and 2 months, and 
I have been going once or twice a year. I have not seen any of my 
Democratic colleagues down there. I wouldn't be shocked if I didn't see 
somebody down there in the near future because it is an election year.
  They are paying lip service to the crisis at the border. They don't 
listen to their rhetoric. Look at their actions. Democrats are not 
doing anything of substance that would actually help. President Biden 
could start by undoing all 94 Executive actions on immigration. We 
didn't need to do that, but he did it because he wants open borders.
  Earlier today, I spoke at length about why the Schumer-Murphy border 
bill is not good enough. I won't belabor the point, but, as Senator 
Murphy said, under their bill, the border never closes. That gets 
pretty much to the point. Even at 5,000 crossings a day, we would still 
process 1,400 illegals per day--1,400.
  This is like putting a bandaid on a bullet hole. Why even worry about 
it?
  The acceptable number of illegal crossings is not 5,000. It is not 
4,000. It is zero. In a TV interview a few days ago, Chris Murphy said:

       We failed to deliver for the [American] people we care 
     about most.

  No, they care more about the undocumented Americans.
  What is an undocumented American? Undocumented is just a leftwing 
code for illegal. They don't like using the word ``illegal.'' The term 
used in Federal law is ``illegal alien.'' That is who we are talking 
about.
  These are not Americans who lost their paperwork and just can't find 
their documents or lost their passport. These are illegal aliens who 
have no right--no right--to be here. First, we stop them from coming 
in, and then we deport the ones who are here.
  For decades, we have been told that there are about 11 or 12 million 
illegals here right now. I would say that is very, very short on 
numbers, but this is a huge problem. Alabama's population is 5 
million--my home State. So there are two States of Alabama's worth of 
illegals already here before Joe Biden let in the other 8 million. This 
takes away power from American citizens.
  They are overrunning our hospitals, our schools. They are even 
affecting the balance of power in Congress and the electoral college. 
Seats in the House of Representatives are divided up based on census. 
Votes in an electoral college are based in votes on Congress. Right 
now, illegals are counted as part of the census.
  A Democratic Member of Congress went on TV recently and said:

       I need more people in my district just for redistricting 
     purposes.

  The presence of tens of millions of illegals in this country is 
tipping power to blue cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and 
Los Angeles.
  It is watering down the power of the American voter. I joined with 
Senator Hagerty to introduce legislation to fix this. Only American 
citizens should have representation in Congress. We ought to count 
citizens only. Otherwise, our voting system is not equal for all 
Americans.
  This shouldn't be a partisan issue. This should be an American issue. 
But it looks like a partisan issue when Democrats in Congress go on 
television and say they need more illegals in their State for 
redistricting.
  Democrats have shown no willingness to stop this crisis--none. They 
put out some press releases and a few vague statements in the press, 
but they have taken no meaningful action in 3 years. Actions speaks 
louder than words.
  Remember, President Trump had the same laws on the books as President 
Biden, but President Trump secured the border. He went with the law. He 
went with the Constitution. Joe Biden opened it up.
  And so new laws are not absolutely necessary, but certain new laws 
would be very helpful. And so, right now, I would like to propose an 
amendment to the Ukraine bill that would actually secure the border. My 
amendment is still a bill. It is a bill I have introduced called the 
Border Safety and Security

[[Page S904]]

Act. The bill would simply suspend all illegal entries, completely, 
until the Department of Homeland Security has operational control over 
the border.
  My amendment also prohibits mass parole programs. The Schumer border 
bill would have allowed parole programs to continue at an unlimited 
pace.
  My amendment prohibits catch-and-release and requires detention. The 
Schumer bill would require release of illegal aliens.
  The Schumer bill would have allowed up to 4,999 border crossings a 
day. My amendment would mean zero crossings as soon as it is signed 
into law.
  It also allows States to sue the administration if it doesn't do its 
job and enforce the laws.
  We should not pass a Ukraine bill until we first pass a border bill 
worthy of the name. That was my position in December, and it is my 
position now. Either we will end this border crisis, or this border 
crisis will end us.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.
  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, often the titles of bills before the 
legislature don't really represent what the bill stands for. The title 
of this bill should say ``Ukraine First, America Last'' because that is 
what this is really about.
  Now, bills in the legislature, bills that come before the Senate, 
don't have pictures or covers on them like a book would have or a 
magazine. But if this bill had an image or a cover on the front of the 
bill, the image would be the migrant in New York who assaulted a police 
officer, was freed from jail on no bail, and gave the middle finger of 
both hands to America.
  That is what this bill is. It is the middle finger to America. This 
bill is the middle finger to every working man and woman in America, 
every struggling American family. This bill gives them the middle 
finger and says: We don't care about you. We care more about Ukraine 
than we care about our southern border.
  We don't seem to care or these ``Ukraine Firsters'' don't seem to 
care about the crime that is happening. They don't seem to care about 
the assault on a police officer in New York. They are intent on more 
coming in. Just that one image of that man, that migrant, that illegal 
immigrant who came across the border and decided to assault, with a 
whole group of other thugs, to assault a police officer in New York--
just that image alone ought to be enough for us to say: Enough is 
enough.
  Enough is enough. We really have to control our border. Guess what. 
From now on, the only people who can come into America are legal 
immigrants. But this bill--this bill--ignores the southern border. 
Almost a million people came over the border in the last 3 months, 
almost a million people. And the ``Ukraine Firsters'' are saying: We 
don't care about the southern border; we care about Ukraine first.
  And so the picture, the image that every American should have when 
they see all of these billions of dollars--$60 billion being shoveled 
out the door, being loaded on the plane--as you see the smiling 
politicians gleefully dropping off the pallets of cash over there, 
every American should remember the image of the young man giving 
America the bird after he assaulted a police officer.
  That is the image of this bill. That is the image of the ``Ukraine 
Firsters,'' and nobody should forget about it.
  When we look at the problems that we face, we need to be fully aware 
that there is no pot of money. There are no surplus funds. There is no 
money to give to Ukraine. We don't have enough money to pay our bills. 
We do not have enough money to pay for what we budget every year. In 
fact, the entire budget that Congress votes on is borrowed.
  Let me make that very clear: The entire budget--not a little bit of 
it, not half of it, the entire budget--is borrowed. This would be like 
someone saying: Well, yeah, I don't have any money for rent, and I 
don't have a job. I am going to borrow the money for my rent.
  That is essentially where we are.
  Two-thirds of spending up here is entitlements. All of the tax 
revenue from every source that comes into the Federal Government is 
only enough to pay for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and food 
stamps. Everything else is borrowed. And we don't vote on the 
entitlements. The entitlements are on autopilot.
  What do we vote on? We vote on what is military discretionary and 
nonmilitary discretionary--$1.5 trillion.
  So people talk about: What is a trillion dollars? Well, we are 
running a $1.5 trillion deficit in 1 year. So in 2 years, $3 trillion 
is accumulated. How much is a trillion? How much is $3 trillion? If you 
take a trillion in $1 bills and you stack them up, $3 trillion would 
reach to the Moon. So 240,000 miles high would be the stack of $1 
bills. That is what we borrow in a 2-year period.
  But it is accelerating. Just in the last week, the Federal Reserve 
Chairman said the debt problem is ``urgent.'' Jamie Dimon, head of one 
of the big banks, JPMorgan Chase, says: The problem is urgent. Some of 
the economists and authors that wrote about the collapse in 2008 that 
predicted it coming have said that the debt is an urgent problem.
  So how does the Senate respond to some of the keenest minds in the 
country saying that we have a debt crisis? They respond by sending $100 
billion of your money overseas.
  And it is not money we have got on hand. It is not cash on hand. We 
don't have any money. We are flat broke.
  People say: It is for our national defense. We have these ``Cold 
Warriors'' who still believe in the domino theory, and they say we are 
going to be somehow overrun by communists if we don't do this.
  But we have no money. There is no money to be sent over there. It all 
has to be borrowed.
  The title of this bill should be ``Ukraine First, America Last,'' if 
they were being honest.
  Sixty-one percent of Americans work paycheck to paycheck. Eight out 
of 10 Americans who make $50,000 don't have enough money on hand to pay 
their bills. If something goes wrong for them, do you think they are 
excited about having their tax dollars shipped off to Ukraine?
  Ukraine first, America last--that is what this bill is about. It is 
about giving the middle finger to America. It is about giving the 
middle finger to every working-class man and woman in America. It is an 
insult. It should be rejected. It should be soundly rejected, and we 
should get back to the business of this country, which is protecting 
our borders.
  We have got a real problem. Democrats didn't even seem to think there 
was a border problem until a few hundred of them were shipped to New 
York, and, all of a sudden, they think there is a problem now. So they 
put them up in a fancy hotel, and they spend millions of dollars 
coddling them.
  But, mark my words, the American people are smarter than the elitists 
up here. The title of this bill is and ought to be if they were honest: 
``Ukraine First and America Last.'' That is what the authors should 
have called this bill.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  How much time do I have remaining?
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.
  Mr. PAUL. I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.
  Mr. LEE. Madam President, there are a number of things that make the 
U.S. Senate unique as an institution. We have got every single State in 
the Union that is represented equally. If you are a big State or a 
small State, a huge population or a tiny one, you have got two 
Senators. That makes our work more important and all the more unique. 
We need to represent our States, looking out for the people of our 
States, and our States sometimes as States.
  I can make a case that voting to pass this bill under these 
circumstances, without amendments or any language whatsoever forcing 
the issue of border security, forcing the border to be made secure by a 
reluctant, recalcitrant, willfully disobedient administration hellbent 
on not enforcing the border-- this is a decision that empowers drug 
cartels, dissolves our borders, and spends insane amounts of money that 
we don't have on priorities of foreign countries--all at the same time.

  Now, look, Senators here today, as always, have an obligation to vote 
no on bills that do bad things. We have an obligation to vote no today 
on bills--including and especially this bill--but

[[Page S905]]

all bills, certainly, that prioritize gangs above Governors, cartels 
above courts, encourage breaking the law over enforcing the law.
  Voting yes on this bill is a capitulation. It is a surrender. It is a 
vote for flooded classrooms and crowded hospitals. It is a vote for 
increased homelessness, deaths by overdose. It is a vote that 
undermines law enforcement; puts citizenship itself at risk and in 
doubt; adds burdens to teachers, food banks; undercuts safety in our 
community parks; and threatens the first jobs that lead to the second 
jobs that, ultimately, culminate in the best jobs for our younger 
people.
  Those who vote yes undermine what Senators are elected to do first 
and foremost, which is to represent our States, not sides. Every 
Senator has the chance--the chance today, the chance tonight, this very 
evening, to vote no on this bill and, by so doing, vote in support of 
Governors, schools, hospitals, churches, playgrounds, clean streets, 
and safe neighborhoods.
  By voting against more funding for Ukraine tonight in this bill 
without any language finally compelling President Biden to enforce the 
border, Senators have a chance to vote against more border chaos, no to 
sanctioned corruptions, and no to shifting our burden of representation 
onto the shoulders of families, police officers, charitable 
organizations, school principals, judges, doctors, and parents.
  Look, at the end of the day, everyone wants peace. World peace, 
however, isn't always within our grasp. World peace isn't our principal 
business. All we can do is world funding, and that is all government 
can ever do is tax, spend, print, and force.
  Our economy is our business; our debt reduction is our business; our 
leadership, due to our multilateral strength, is essential.
  But this, alas, undermines what makes us strong in an attempt to 
prove our strength. And, in trying to do that, we will become less 
strong.
  We are not helping any group of people whenever we prolong a war in 
which they are involved. It doesn't help the Ukrainian people to 
prolong their suffering in this war, and it doesn't help our people to 
refuse to finally--after the Senate Republican conference has come to a 
conclusion, after Senate Republicans have made a commitment to each 
other, to our counterparts in the House, to voters in our respective 
States and across America, we use this as an opportunity to force a 
bargain, a real bargain, a bargain that harnesses appetite more 
prevalent on the left to fund Ukraine and an appetite, sadly, existing 
almost exclusively among Republicans to force the issue of border 
security.
  We committed to that some 3 months ago. We got a bill Sunday night, a 
week ago Sunday night at 7 p.m. eastern standard time that, 
unfortunately, didn't do that. It did other things. It contained some 
provisions that might prove helpful here and there, but it contained a 
lot of other provisions that made clear it wouldn't force this 
administration to do what this administration could already do.
  That was the essence of the bargain that we struck, the agreement, 
the commitment that we made to each other and to our voters months ago. 
Republicans stand for border security and the rule of law.
  Regardless of where they come down on Ukraine aid, they should 
realize that we are forfeiting that leverage, that bargaining power 
tonight if we vote for this. I encourage my colleagues emphatically to 
oppose cloture tonight. And by opposing cloture, to vote for America's 
communities and for the rule of law.
  I yield the floor and reserve the balance of my time.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.
  Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, the vote we will soon take to provide 
military weapons for Ukraine is the most important vote we will ever 
take as U.S. Senators. We are not being asked to send American troops 
into war. We are asked to help the Ukrainians defend themselves.
  If we fail to help Ukraine, Putin will invade a NATO nation. He may 
delay his next invasion until he rebuilds his decimated military, but 
we must be clear-eyed. Ukraine is not the end; it is a step.
  If we fail to help Ukraine, China will eventually absorb Taiwan. If 
we fail to help Ukraine, we will abandon our word and our commitment, 
providing to our friends a view that America cannot be trusted.
  The Chinese Communist Party is already spreading propaganda, using 
our delay as a warning to Taiwan that the United States will not be 
there to help in the face of China's threat.
  If we fail to help Ukraine, NATO, the alliance that has prevented 
great power conflict for over 75 years, will falter and eventually 
disintegrate.
  If we fail to help Ukraine, America will cease to be the arsenal of 
democracy. It will cease to be the leader of the free world. We will be 
replaced by the authoritarians: China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
  If we fail to help Ukraine, we will be known not as our fathers and 
mothers were, the ``greatest generation,'' but as the worst generation.
  Now, for months, I have listened to the arguments for denying help to 
the Ukrainian people. I have observed that the reasons have evolved 
over time. First, it was claimed that Europe was not paying their fair 
share. That was proven incorrect. Our allies have already contributed 
more than $96 billion in aid, and the EU earlier this month agreed to 
provide $54 billion more over the next 4 years.
  Next, it was argued that we should, instead, focus on the Pacific and 
Taiwan, but Taiwan and Japan and South Korea tell us that the single 
best thing we can do to dissuade China's aggression is to support 
Ukraine.
  Next, we were told that we couldn't afford $60 billion for Ukraine-
related funding. But, somehow, we can afford an $850 billion annual 
defense budget, an annual trillion-dollar deficits--which has happened 
under both former President Trump and President Biden.
  Next, it was claimed that we would have insufficient weapons to 
defend America and Israel if we send more weapons to Ukraine. But the 
Department of Defense has explained that helping Ukraine will actually 
strengthen our national security by helping to rebuild our depleted 
military-industrial base.
  The latest excuse for denying aid to Ukraine is that this bill is a 
clever disguise to set up an impeachment of Donald Trump at some point 
in the future. Under this so-called logic, Trump has to be elected, 
Democrats have to win the House, and those Democrats have to be unable 
to find any other discretion of Donald Trump's upon which to base an 
impeachment.
  Now, I know that the shock jocks and online instigators have 
effectively riled up many in the far reaches of my party. But if your 
position is being cheered by Vladimir Putin, it is time to reconsider 
your position.
  Now, I can't see into the future. But there are no guarantees that 
Ukraine will defeat Russia, but that does not mean that we should stand 
back and let Putin have his way with Europe.
  What sending weapons to Ukraine does do is help discourage further 
Russian and Chinese invasions, which could draw us in. It helps 
preserve NATO. It allows America to remain the leader of the free 
world, and it shows that we honor our word to our friends and allies.
  Lech Walesa, the first democratically elected President of Poland 
since 1926 and someone I have been fortunate enough to meet with, 
recently wrote to all the U.S. Senators. He said this:

       You are obliged to assure a peaceful future for your 
     children. Our grandchildren will never forgive us if we fail 
     to stop Russia now. If the U.S. does not lead, nobody will.

  I couldn't agree more. Helping a free people defend their freedom is 
simply the right thing to do.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.
  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, last week, General Kurilla, the 
Commander of U.S. Central Command, gave me a briefing that was directly 
relevant to the national securities supplement that we are now 
considering. During the course of that briefing, the general told me 
that this is the most dangerous security situation in 50 years. The 
threats that the United States faces from an aggressive Iran and its 
proxies, an imperialistic Russia, a hegemonic China, are 
interconnected, and they require our immediate attention and a strong 
response.
  That is why this bill focuses on fortifying our military, rebuilding 
our

[[Page S906]]

own defense-industrial base, and strengthening and defending our 
partners and allies.
  This legislation would send a strong message to Putin that his goal 
of capturing free democratic nations will not be allowed to succeed. It 
would reassure our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel, that 
terrorists will not achieve their goal of wiping that nation off the 
map, and it would counter ever-growing Chinese aggression.
  I urge our colleagues to recognize the perilous times in which we are 
living and vote for this absolutely essential national security bill. 
The world is watching to see if the United States is still the leader 
of the free world.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we all understand we cannot leave our 
job here unfinished. The clock is ticking right now, and there is so 
much at stake. We have a strong, bipartisan package to support our 
allies in Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific and provide 
humanitarian aid to civilians who are caught in conflict. By passing 
this bill, we would show our allies we stand by our word and we will 
help them in the time of need. We will show dictators that their 
flagrant attacks will not go unchecked and they cannot steamroll our 
allies. And we will show the world that American leadership is still 
alive and well and that we are still a strong protector of democracy 
and provider of humanitarian aid.
  Given all the stakes of this moment, now--right now--is a critical 
time to send that message, which is why I am glad we are here on the 
cusp of passing this bill in the Senate.
  And to my colleagues who have been holding this up and dragging the 
process out, we can disagree. You can vote against this. That is how it 
works. But one way or another, this aid will get to our allies. We 
spent months going back and forth to try and get a bill to the floor, 
and now we are here. We are not going to let a few more hours or a few 
more days wear us down.
  However, what is an inconvenient delay for the U.S. Senate is a 
dangerous one for our allies in Ukraine. Putin's forces are on the 
march as we speak. Ukrainians are fighting bravely to defend their 
homeland, but they are running lower and lower on bullets, air defense 
missiles, and more every day.
  We measure time in hours; they are measuring it in how many bullets 
they have left, how many more missiles fall on their cities, and how 
much closer Putin's tanks are getting. The question for us is: How long 
is this going to take? The question for them is: How much longer can 
they hold out?
  We cannot leave them waiting. So I urge my colleagues to support 
moving forward on these votes, vote to waive the budget point of order, 
and let's keep this bill moving.
  And once we get it through the Senate, we are going to push every way 
we can to get this to the President's desk and signed into law.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.

Mr. President, this is indeed a historic day--the passage 
of the national security supplemental appropriations bill. I want to 
commend the extraordinary work of Leader Schumer, of Leader McConnell, 
of our Appropriations chair and vice chair, Senator Murray and Senator 
Collins, and also our colleagues who worked so hard on the bipartisan 
border agreement that was ultimately repudiated by the Republicans.
  The supplemental includes important additional military aid for 
Ukraine and Taiwan and aid for Israel and humanitarian aid for the 
Palestinians and other vulnerable populations.
  I unequivocally support the additional aid for Ukraine. It is facing 
an existential threat. We must pass that aid. I am very pleased to see 
that Ukraine is going to be receiving the aid it desperately needs. 
Putin must be stopped.
  The other provision in the supplemental I strongly support is funding 
for the humanitarian aid for Palestinians and for humanitarian 
catastrophes around the globe. But the situation in Gaza is what is of 
great concern to me. It is horrific.
  Two million Palestinians have been uprooted from their homes. Those 
homes have been reduced to rubble. Folks are desperately seeking to 
survive. They lack adequate food, safe water, and shelter. Many are 
injured without anything remotely resembling sufficient medical care or 
shelter.
  I introduced a resolution, cosponsored by 15 of my colleagues, urging 
the administration to dramatically increase access and delivery of 
humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza, and I am gratified that the 
supplemental does include several billions of dollars for that purpose.
  But despite these provisions that I do support, I voted against the 
supplemental for one key reason: I cannot in good conscience support 
sending billions of additional taxpayer dollars for Prime Minister 
Netanyahu's military campaign in Gaza. It is a campaign that has killed 
and wounded a shocking number of civilians. It has created a massive 
humanitarian crisis with no end in sight. It has inflamed tensions in 
the Middle East, eroding support among Arab States that had been 
aligned with Israel. And, of course, it has severely compromised any 
remaining hope--almost all remaining hope for the two-state solution 
that we all know is ultimately essential for peace in the Middle East. 
And this is an opinion that is not just my own, but it is

[[Page S961]]

expressed by a large majority of Vermonters who have contacted me and 
shared their dismay at the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.
  During my years in Congress, like the Presiding Officer, I have voted 
for tens of billions of dollars in aid for Israel, but I cannot send 
more taxpayer dollars to support Prime Minister Netanyahu's continued 
bombardment in the wholesale destruction of Gaza, knowing the calamity 
that more U.S. bombs and artillery shells will cause for countless more 
civilians who had nothing whatsoever to do with the atrocities that 
were committed by Hamas terrorists on October 7.
  As I made clear on November 28 when I called for an indefinite cease-
fire in Gaza, really for the purpose of saving civilian lives, we all 
do want Hamas gone. They are terrorists. The depth and cruelty Hamas 
perpetrated against innocent, defenseless people, many of them women 
and children, was appalling. It was reminiscent of the brutality of 
ISIS. The viciousness of the Hamas attack was intended to terrorize and 
traumatize all Israelis. And it goes without saying that Israel has a 
right and responsibility to pursue those who ordered and carried out 
the October 7 attacks.
  But Israel's enemy is Hamas, not the Palestinian people, and neither 
Israel nor any country has the right to use lethal force in ways that 
violate the laws of armed conflict by inflicting egregious and 
disproportionate harm to civilians. Palestinian civilians are, by 
definition, innocent. They are defenseless, as were Hamas's victims.

  What has occurred in Gaza using weapons and munitions provided by the 
United States and what will continue to occur as long as Prime Minister 
Netanyahu pursues his current war strategy is more of the same. It is a 
strategy which I and many others believe is deeply flawed. It has cost 
more than 28,000 Palestinian lives.
  Netanyahu's war plan has never been articulated beyond his oft-
repeated refrain of pursuing nothing less than the complete destruction 
of Hamas and the release of the hostages.
  Like many of us, I have spoken with families of hostages who are 
desperately waiting for the safe return of their loved ones, who are 
trapped in the vast network of Hamas tunnels--narrow, cloistered, dark 
tunnels--as Israeli bombs explode above. It is hard to imagine anything 
that is more terrifying for the hostages, as well as for their 
families, as the weeks turn into months with no end in sight.
  Since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza nearly 4 months ago, Prime 
Minister Netanyahu has said nothing about what Israel's strategy is for 
the future of Gaza or the people of Gaza after Gaza is in ruins when 
the war ends.
  Obliterating civilian infrastructure--and that is happening now with 
demolitions set to take down homes and infrastructure--makes it 
impossible for people to have a place to return to. Intentionally 
reducing to rubble hospitals, schools, mosques, and apartment buildings 
is not right. Forcibly displacing 2 million people and creating a 
humanitarian catastrophe and looming famine, this is not an acceptable 
strategy.
  The inescapable conclusion is that the Netanyahu government is not 
listening--is not listening to the White House and President Biden, is 
not listening to key Arab governments that are imploring Israel to 
change course.
  Their belief, which I share, is that the way to prevent a wider war 
and begin building a safer and ultimately more secure Middle East is to 
stop killing and otherwise mistreating innocent Palestinians.
  Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has rejected out of hand the right of 
Palestinians to have a state of their own, is stubbornly pursuing what 
can only be called a scorched-earth policy. It is difficult not to 
conclude that his enemy is not only Hamas but the Palestinians.
  To make matters worse, he and other Israeli officials continue to 
deny that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, despite the 
overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
  How much worse does the situation have to get in Gaza? How much wider 
of a war in the Middle East will be accepted before we use the leverage 
America does have, including the withholding of additional lethal aid, 
to get Israel to stop that bombing campaign, to negotiate a cease-fire 
and the release of the remaining hostages, and to allow the dramatic 
increase in food and water and other humanitarian aid that is needed to 
prevent the widespread starvation, death, and disease the United 
Nations and other relief organizations warn are imminent, and to 
negotiate an end to the war?
  The massive destruction and loss of innocent life is not making 
Israel more secure. To the contrary, it has eroded progress Israel has 
made with its neighboring Arab States, it has inflamed tensions in the 
Middle East, and it has incited attacks on American soldiers. It has 
severely damaged Israel's reputation on the world stage and set back 
the cause of peace in the Middle East, which we must continue to strive 
to achieve.
  The possibility of a two-state solution, which Prime Minister 
Netanyahu has publicly rejected, is on life support. Throughout the 
years, the United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in 
aid to the Netanyahu government, in effect consistently financing a 
government that implements policies that we support for a two-state 
solution but pursues policies that make it impossible for a viable 
independent State of Palestine to emerge. That has been endorsed--a 
two-state solution--by Republican and Democratic administrations. We 
have to mean what we say.
  This must end, and it must end now by sparing innocent Palestinians 
in Israel's pursuit of Hamas and renewing vigorous efforts to create a 
viable Palestinian State--something the Biden administration is doing 
energetically.
  Mr. President, a majority of the Senate has voted to approve 
additional military aid for Israel. I know that the White House will 
not treat that as a blank check. We must increase pressure on the 
Netanyahu government to respect international humanitarian law.
  I am very encouraged by the White House's release on February 8 of an 
unprecedented national security memorandum based on an amendment 
sponsored by Senator Van Hollen and cosponsored by many of us, 
including the Presiding Officer. It articulates a global policy and 
reporting requirements that put Israel and other recipients of U.S. 
military aid on notice that our aid is contingent on their written 
commitment and adherence to U.S. and international laws of armed 
conflict and allowing the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid.
  I also urge the Secretary of State to apply the Leahy law, passed by 
my predecessor, Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Apply that to Israel. This 
has not been the practice.
  For far too long, successive administrations have failed to apply the 
law to the Israel Defense Forces despite many incidents when the IDF 
was credibly implicated in violations of the human rights of 
Palestinians. The Leahy Law is the law of the United States. It should 
be enforced.
  Finally, Mr. President, I do want to say a few words about the 
southern border.
  Our immigration system is broken. Our southern border is overwhelmed 
with thousands of would-be immigrants on a near daily basis. Asylum 
seekers can wait 5 years or more to plant roots in this country before 
learning their fate. They are forced to wait to join the workforce when 
they are here and face bureaucratic backlogs. Most potential immigrants 
have no meaningful way to enter the U.S. legally, given the failure of 
Congress to improve the system for 30 years. Cities all around our 
country are dealing with the consequences and are exhausted. In 
essence, we don't have a functioning immigration system.
  I commend my colleagues, Senators Sinema, Lankford, and Murphy, for 
their extraordinary work, and I am very disappointed that that effort 
was rejected and repudiated by our Republican colleagues.
  The agreement proposed reforms to improve border security that both 
Republicans and Democrats have long recognized that we need in order to 
significantly improve our operations at the border and have a secure 
border. It provides that agreement for additional pathways for legal 
migration, and we need legal migration.

[[Page S962]]

  Our rural communities, like those in Vermont, rely on immigrant and 
seasonal farmworkers and know how important improving our legal 
migration system is to our rural economy.
  We need to address the limited number of family- and employment-based 
visas to address the backlog of green card applications that already 
exceed 10 million people, and we need more worker visas and other 
alternatives for our employers to be able to get the job done.
  I voted last week to proceed on the first version of that border 
agreement that was worked out by our colleagues in the hope that we 
could work and pass amendments, improve it, and pass it. But the 
Republicans who first embraced that agreement or that effort turned 
their backs once Donald Trump insisted they take no action to secure 
the southern border before the November election. Donald Trump has a 
campaign, and we have a responsibility to govern, and that includes 
taking action on the southern border.
  That situation is the result of inaction over many years. Republicans 
and Democrats can take credit for some of those failures, but we have 
to do there what we have done in so many other places--work together to 
get a secure border, find pathways for legal migration, and have safety 
and security at a border we control.
  I am going to end where I began, and that is by thanking Leader 
Schumer and Leader McConnell for their extraordinary effort in getting 
us to this vote on this important legislation.
  I also want to say to the Senate staff and to our Senate pages, who 
have been here all night: Thank you. We are very grateful for the work 
that you do. This was not just an important day; it has been an 
important several months where the business of the Senate in debating 
the important issues of our time has occurred, and you all have been 
part of history."

understand, it always appears to me that the more important the issue, 
the less it gets discussed here in the Congress and in the media--more 
important, less discussion.
  And today I want to say a few words about one of those issues, and 
that is the ongoing and unprecedented humanitarian disaster which is 
taking place in Gaza and which is getting worse every single day.
  On October 7, as I think we all know, Hamas established and went 
forward with a brutal terrorist attack against Israel killing 1,200 
innocent people and took 230 hostages, some 100 of them are still in 
captivity. And in my view as I said many times, Israel had a right to 
respond to that attack and go after Hamas.
  But what Israel did not have the right to do and does not have the 
right to do is to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, 
which is exactly what has occurred.
  When I talk about issues that we in Congress do not fully engage in, 
discuss, appreciate, what we are talking about is that in Gaza right 
now some 30,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 70,000 have 
been injured since that war began. This is a country, an area, of 2.2 
million people. Two-thirds of those who have been killed or injured are 
women and children.
  Unbelievably, and I think this is another point that is not discussed 
very often--1.7 million Palestinians, 80 percent of the population--80 
percent of the population of Gaza has been driven from their homes. The 
men, women, and children have been driven from their homes with no safe 
place to go and no idea as to whether or not they will ever return to 
their communities.
  Imagine that for a moment. Little kids 5 years old, 3 years old--they 
don't know what is going on. Bombs falling, pushed out of their homes, 
they don't know where they are going or whether, in fact, they will 
ever, ever return to their communities.
  The bombing of Gaza--and again it must be talked about over and over 
again--is almost unprecedented in modern history. Seventy percent of 
the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed. Let me repeat 
that. Seventy percent of the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or 
destroyed. The civilian infrastructure of Gaza has been devastated. 
There is virtually no electricity. There are few supplies of clean 
water. There is not one functional hospital for 2.2 million residents 
of Gaza.
  There is not enough food, not enough water, not enough fuel, and not 
enough medicine. And increasingly for the people of Gaza, there is no 
hope. This is the horrific reality. And I know here in

[[Page S1016]]

the Senate we deal with a lot of stuff, but this is the reality that 
cannot be ignored. It must be dealt with. The catastrophe unfolding in 
Gaza today, right now as we speak, is among the worst humanitarian 
disasters in modern history. And while this body was in recess--we had 
a 2-week break. While we were safely with our families, the urgency of 
this crisis only increased. We are truly approaching a point of no 
return.
  For months, the United Nations and other aid organizations have 
warned that the constant bombing and the restrictions on humanitarian 
aid entering Gaza raised the risk of famine--of famine and disease.
  Two months ago, the U.N. warned that the whole population of Gaza was 
hungry--people were going hungry--and that more than half a million 
people faced the most severe category of food insecurity. That is fancy 
terminology for talking about people in desperate need of food.
  Now, today, the worst of those fears are becoming reality. Hundreds 
of thousands of children in Gaza, beautiful little kids, are starving 
to death. Last week, the World Food Programme reported that nutrition 
screenings found that one in six children under the age of 12 in 
northern Gaza are acutely malnourished and 3 percent are experiencing 
child ``wasting,'' a terrible, terrible term that talks about--that 
describes the destruction of human life for kids. These children will 
die without urgent treatment. In other words, if all of the aid in the 
world came in tomorrow, many hundreds of thousands of children in Gaza 
have been permanently damaged.
  Malnutrition in children causes cognitive and emotional distress, 
physical distress. So let us contemplate that. Let us think about that 
for a moment. If nothing changes in the coming weeks, thousands of 
children in Gaza will begin to die of starvation and easily preventable 
diseases caused by the lack of food, medicine, and clean drinking 
water.
  Was this a natural catastrophe? Was this a storm? Was this an 
earthquake? No. This is a manmade disaster. Already, some 90 percent of 
children under 5 in Gaza have one or more infectious diseases, 
according to the U.N., and 70 percent have had diarrhea in the past 2 
weeks due to the lack of clean drinking water.
  This is an urgent humanitarian crisis.
  It cannot be ignored. It must be addressed. Without an immediate 
humanitarian cease-fire and an urgent--urgent--expansion of the relief 
efforts, even more people could end up dying from the lack of basic 
supplies than have been killed in the bombing. In other words, what we 
are looking at is thousands of people are dying, have died from the 
bombs, and now we are going to see more people die from starvation and 
diseases as a result of no clean water or sanitation.
  Scientists at Johns Hopkins University recently modeled what could 
happen over the next 6 months if nothing changes and concluded that 
some 85,000 more people could die in Gaza over that period and more 
from disease.
  We cannot let this disaster continue. Let us be clear--be clear why 
this is happening. It is happening because Israel is simply not letting 
in enough aid, not enough food, not enough water, not enough medical 
supplies, not enough fuel. It is not more complicated than that. This 
is a manmade crisis caused by Israel, and it can be changed tomorrow.
  Israeli restrictions on aid entering Gaza mean that only a tiny 
fraction of the food, water, medicine, and fuel that is needed can get 
into Gaza. Even then, once aid gets in, Israeli bombing and military 
activities mean that very little of that aid can reach beyond the 
immediate area around the Rafah border crossing from Egypt. What that 
means is that some of the most desperate areas of Gaza, that in those 
areas virtually no aid can get through at all. So it is not only that 
aid is not getting in, what aid that is getting in is not going to 
those locations where it is needed the most.
  Even more distressing, aid convoys have been turned back or fired 
upon even after previously clearing their route with the Israeli 
military. In other words, the aid people tell the Israeli military 
where they are going, and the result of that is they, in fact, get 
bombed.
  Bottom line. Despite the urgency of this crisis and the growing 
starvation of the people of Gaza, humanitarian access has actually 
gotten worse--worse--in recent weeks. About 80 trucks per day have 
gotten into Gaza over the last 3 weeks, down by roughly 40 percent from 
earlier periods.
  Before the war, before the homelessness, and before the starvation, 
some 500 trucks per day delivered basic necessities into Gaza. Almost 
all aid deliveries to northern Gaza have been suspended. The Israeli 
Government has rejected most requests for access to the north, and the 
situation has become too dangerous for aid to be safely delivered. The 
reason that aid delivery has become increasingly dangerous is that the 
Israeli military has shown little regard for the safety of humanitarian 
operations.
  Quite the contrary. Earlier this month, the Israeli military fired on 
a U.N. food aid convoy even though it had previously cleared its route 
and timing with the Israelis.
  And here is something that I hope every American hears--that, up 
until now, since this war began, 161 U.N. staff and at least 340 health 
workers have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7. In other 
words, the people who are trying to help the desperate--the people who 
are trying to deliver aid, the people who are trying to provide 
healthcare--are being killed in large numbers.
  The situation today is obviously desperate and getting more and more 
desperate; and as an indication of that desperation, humanitarian aid 
trucks that do get through to northern Gaza have been mobbed by 
starving people. That is the reality. When a truck manages to get 
through, aid is not distributed in an orderly way. Hungry people are 
mobbing the trucks to grab food to feed their kids. The U.N.'s leading 
expert on access to food, this week, said Israel is intentionally 
denying access to food. That is a war crime.
  Unbelievably, in the midst of this humanitarian cataclysm, rather 
than work to improve coordination with the U.N. and get basic supplies 
to Palestinians in the war zone, there has been a concerted attack on 
UNRWA, the largest U.N. agency operating in Gaza and the backbone of 
the humanitarian aid operation. They are the ones who do the lion's 
share of the work in getting humanitarian aid to the civilian 
population. UNRWA runs schools, healthcare, water sanitation, and food 
assistance for Palestinians in Gaza as well as in the West Bank and the 
wider region. Israel has accused 12 UNRWA employees of taking part in 
the October 7 attack--12 employees. This is a serious allegation, and 
it is being investigated seriously, but you don't starve 2 million 
people because of the alleged actions of 12 UNRWA employees out of a 
total workforce of 30,000.
  Despite UNRWA's indispensable role in addressing this unprecedented 
humanitarian disaster, Congress is now considering legislation--Senate-
passed legislation--that would actually prohibit funding for this 
agency, which would only make a horrible situation even worse. Children 
are starving. People don't have water. People don't have medical 
supplies. The agency that historically has done the work of getting aid 
out to people is now being unfunded. The U.S. decision to pause its 
funding for UNRWA has left the agency at a breaking point. That 
decision must be reconsidered immediately.
  That brings to us the United States' role in this crisis, because the 
point is: We are not just looking at some distant part of the world 
where terrible things are happening and we are just learning about it 
and we have nothing to do with it. It is quite the contrary. Simply, we 
are deeply complicit in the humanitarian disaster and the horror that 
is taking place in Gaza today. Most of the bombs and most of the 
military equipment that the Israeli Government is using in Gaza is 
provided by the United States and subsidized by American taxpayers. 
This is not just an Israeli war; this is an American war as well. We 
are providing the weapons for Netanyahu to wage this war.
  I met earlier today with human rights experts from Amnesty 
International. Amnesty researchers have painstakingly documented the 
use of U.S. weapons in numerous Israeli strikes that break the 
international

[[Page S1017]]

laws of war. Most recently, Amnesty documented four unlawful strikes in 
Rafah in December-January that killed at least 95 civilians, including 
42 children, and some of those attacks were done with U.S. weapons.
  The U.S. has laws on the books intended to prevent these kinds of 
human rights violations that are being done with U.S.-provided weapons. 
The problem is that we have very rarely enforced them with any country, 
and we have never enforced them with Israel. For months, as I think all 
of us know, President Biden has been trying to get Israeli Prime 
Minister Netanyahu and his extreme rightwing government to scale back 
the indiscriminate bombing. So far, Netanyahu has not changed his 
tactics. In fact, humanitarian access has actually deteriorated. The 
situation is getting worse. Netanyahu makes polite sounds when U.S. 
officials visit him in Israel, and then he proceeds to do exactly what 
he wants. And what he wants increasingly seems to be the wholesale 
destruction of Gaza.
  The United States is now focused on negotiating a cease-fire 
agreement that would allow for massive humanitarian aid and the freeing 
of the remaining hostages. I desperately hope that this deal comes 
together. I trust that all of us want the killing to stop and the 
hostages to be freed. But, once again, despite what President Biden is 
fighting for, Netanyahu is resisting. It appears that he and his 
extreme rightwing government are trying to prolong this war to hold 
onto their power and to avoid accountability. President Biden has 
repeatedly said that the only viable path to lasting peace and security 
for Israelis and Palestinians alike is a two-state solution. I agree. 
But, of course, Netanyahu has made it very clear that he is completely 
opposed to that outcome, and he has been opposed to that outcome for 
his entire political career.

  On issue after issue, Prime Minister Netanyahu is deeply opposed to 
the goals of the United States. We want civilian life protected; he 
doesn't seem to care. We want more aid getting into Gaza; he won't 
allow it. We want a two-state solution; he is vigorously opposed. Given 
all of that reality--given the fact that with every aspect of this 
crisis, Netanyahu disagrees with what the U.S. Government wants to see 
happen--it is beyond comprehension as to why the United States is 
preparing to send another $10 billion in unrestricted military aid so 
that Netanyahu can continue the murderous campaign that we oppose.
  Enough is enough. The United States cannot continue to be complicit 
in Netanyahu's war crimes. No more military aid for Israel. Whether 
Netanyahu likes it or not, the United States must continue working 
toward an urgent humanitarian cease-fire to allow for the release of 
the hostages and massive influx of humanitarian aid. We should join 
other countries all over the world to pass a cease-fire resolution at 
the U.N. Security Council that includes the release of the hostages and 
full humanitarian access as previous drafts have done.
  The United States should begin the process of recognizing the 
Palestinian State as a full U.N. member state. This is both a fact--
Palestine is a nation recognized by 139 U.N. member states--and a moral 
imperative in the face of what amounts to illegal Israeli annexation.
  President Biden should also make clear that he will not release any 
additional military funding for Israel without firm commitments that 
the cease-fire will be honored unless broken by Hamas and that full 
humanitarian access will be ensured; that funds for the Palestinian 
Authority will be released; and that illegal Israeli settlements in the 
occupied territories will cease.
  None of this will be easy, but to my mind, it is absolutely morally 
unacceptable that the United States continue its complicity in the 
humanitarian disaster that is taking place in Gaza right now. The time 
is now to say no to the rightwing extremist government of Netanyahu--no 
more money for the Israeli military."

                             BLC Objectives

       Express your commitment to upholding international 
     humanitarian law and addressing global humanitarian crises, 
     including by passing the supplemental funding.
       [Israel/Gaza point to be provided by Team MENA]


                   BLC Message & Suggested Questions

       Israel and Gaza:
       [questions and talking points to follow from Team MENA]
       Kidnapped Ukrainian Children: I know that the ICRC has a 
     unique perspective as one of the few interlocutors that talks 
     to both sides and with the ability to operate in occupied 
     territories in Ukraine as well as within the Russian 
     Federation.
       How do you engage with the Russian government on questions 
     of kidnapped children? Have you found more success engaging 
     with certain Russian agencies than others?
       How does the ICC arrest warrant for Putin and his 
     Commissioner for Children's Rights influence the Russian 
     response to engagement on kidnapped children? Is there 
     additional leverage that the international community could 
     bring to bear to help you succeed in your mission of 
     reuniting families?
       War Crimes and Atrocities in Ukraine:
       Can you discuss the nature of war crimes and atrocities 
     being committed in occupied territories now? Is there 
     additional engagement or resources from the international 
     community necessary to help support victims and prevent 
     future such atrocities and war crimes?
       Sudan: There has been bipartisan and bicameral support for 
     increasing U.S. leadership to resolve the horrific crisis in 
     Sudan. I was pleased to see the Administration name a Special 
     Envoy for Sudan, which I expect to put us in a much better 
     position to exert diplomatic pressure to bring about a 
     ceasefire. In addition to increasing our diplomatic efforts, 
     we need greater resources to address the humanitarian 
     catastrophe.
       Where can the U.S. do more to support the work of the ICRC 
     and other humanitarian organizations in Sudan?
       What is your impression of the effectiveness of U.S. 
     mediation efforts?
       Armenia: USAID has committed more than $4 million in 
     additional humanitarian assistance to people displaced by 
     Azerbaijan's military operation in Nagorno Karabkah. But with 
     over 74,000 refugees, I know that the needs are great.
       Has the international response been sufficient to support 
     the vulnerable population from Karabakh forced to leave their 
     entire lives behind?
       Humanitarian Funding: As you know, the Senate's bill for 
     supplemental funding, which includes more than $9 billion for 
     humanitarian assistance, is still under consideration in the 
     House. This funding is critical to addressing the massive 
     shortfall between available assistance and growing needs.
       Given the growing humanitarian needs, how can Congress more 
     effectively assist the ICRC and push other countries--
     including partners that have traditionally not provided 
     substantial foreign assistance--to step up to the plate?


                               Background

       Gaza: In response to the, October 7 attacks, the ICRC 
     scaled up its humanitarian response in Israel and Gaza. As 
     part of this effort, the ICRC has actively advocated for the 
     release of all hostages immediately and unconditionally. 
     Concurrently, the ICRC has asked to visit the hostages, to 
     check on their conditions, to deliver medical care, and to 
     facilitate communication with their families. When political 
     agreements allowed hostages to be released, the ICRC played 
     the role of neutral intermediary to facilitate the release, 
     transfer, and return of 109 hostages from Gaza to their 
     families. ICRC also facilitated the release, transfer and 
     return of 154 Palestinian detainees from Israeli places of 
     detention to their families. The ICRC works closely with its 
     partners in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent 
     Movement and continues to work closely with local service-
     providers, communities and other partners on the ground.
       Ukraine: With over 800 staff working in eight locations, 
     Ukraine is the ICRC's largest operation in 2024. Working 
     alongside partners from the International Red Cross and Red 
     Crescent Movement, the ICRC has provided humanitarian 
     assistance to over 11.6 million people since February 2022. 
     ICRC staff have visited almost 2,400 prisoners of war on both 
     sides, sharing news and updates directly with thousands of 
     families. The ICRC continues to push for access to all 
     prisoners of war through bilateral dialogue and to advocate 
     for the reunification of kidnapped Ukrainian children with 
     their families.
       Sudan: The ICRC's work in Sudan, in cooperation with the 
     Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRCS), includes promoting 
     respect for International Humanitarian Law (IHL), supporting 
     hospitals and health facilities with equipment and supplies, 
     working with local water authorities on improving people's 
     access to clean water and supporting the authorities in 
     providing rehabilitation services for people with 
     disabilities. The ICRC is helping families separated by 
     conflict or displacement to keep in touch with their loved 
     ones, and has facilitated the release of detainees upon 
     request of the parties. Since the beginning of the conflict 
     between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support 
     Forces (RSF) in April 2023, the ICRC has acted as a neutral 
     intermediary between parties to the conflict and conducted 
     various activities to protect and assist those affected by 
     the consequences of the crisis.
       ICRC Funding: The ICRC is appealing for $2.34 billion in 
     2024, a 13% cut from the previous year's appeal. One quarter 
     of the ICRC's total funding comes from the United States. The 
     Senate-passed supplemental included $3.5 billion in the 
     Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account, which 
     includes funding for the ICRC.
       Biography: Ms. Mirjana Spoljaric Egger has been ICRC 
     President since October 2022. From 2018 to 2022, she served 
     as the United Nations Assistant Secretary-General, Assistant 
     Administrator of the UN Development Program (UNDP), and 
     Director of the Regional Bureau for Europe and the CIS. Prior 
     to joining the UN, Ms. Spoljaric had many years of 
     distinguished service with the Swiss Diplomatic Corps, where 
     she served as Ambassador and Head of the United Nations and 
     International Organizations Division, and as Counsellor and 
     Head of the Political Team at the Permanent Mission of 
     Switzerland to the UN. From 2010-2012, Ms. Spoljaric was 
     seconded to the Office of the Commissioner-General of the UN 
     Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near 
     East (UNRWA) as Senior Advisor covering organizational 
     development, management reforms, and external relations. Ms. 
     Spoljaric studied Philosophy, Economics and International Law 
     at the Universities of Basel and Geneva and holds a master's 
     degree."

Mr. President, I rise today in pursuit of peace in the 
Middle East. After nearly 5 months of war in Gaza, the human suffering 
must end. Just today, Americans woke up to the news that Israeli troops 
had opened fire on Palestinians desperate for humanitarian aid, killing 
dozens and adding to the more than 30,000 people in Gaza who have been 
killed during this conflict.
  Hamas's October 7 terrorist attack on Israel took more than a 
thousand lives. Israel, like every nation, has the right to defend 
itself and the right to prevent another terrorist attack like this one 
from ever occurring again.
  Other rights are important as well. The people who live in the Middle 
East deserve a lasting peace and deserve to live their lives with 
dignity and self-determination.
  For decades, the United States Government has supported a two-state 
solution to guarantee those rights for both Israelis and Palestinians--
two states for two people. For years, I have spoken out against the 
diminishing prospects for a two-state solution. For years, Palestinians 
have been poorly served by their leaders, both in the West Bank and in 
Gaza. For years, even before October 7, Hamas's governance of Gaza was 
a major impediment to peace. And also for years, I have believed that 
Israel's long-term strategic interests were endangered by Prime 
Minister Netanyahu's leadership.
  Since October 7, it has only gotten worse. Prime Minister Netanyahu 
and his rightwing war cabinet have created a massive humanitarian 
disaster, pushing the region even further away from a two-state 
solution. Indiscriminate bombings in Gaza have killed tens of thousands 
of Palestinian civilians, wiping out entire families and leaving 
thousands of children orphaned. Nearly 2 million people have been 
displaced, and 45 percent of the residential buildings in Gaza have 
been destroyed. The Israeli Government's refusal to allow adequate 
humanitarian aid into Gaza has left hundreds of thousands of people on 
the brink of starvation.
  And still, more than 100 hostages are held by Hamas. The Israeli 
Government's top priority should have been to bring those hostages 
home, but, instead, Prime Minister Netanyahu focused on revenge. He 
publicly invoked the plight of hostages to justify indiscriminate 
bombing that thwarts the negotiations that would bring them home. This 
is a betrayal of the families whose loved ones are still held hostage 
by Hamas.
  Netanyahu's opposition to a two-state solution is fierce and 
longstanding. For decades, he has undercut Palestinian independence. He 
has deliberately propped up Hamas to try to keep the Palestinian people 
divided. He approved Qatar's payments to Hamas--payments that may have 
been used for Hamas's military operations. He expanded settlements in 
the West Bank, turning the region into a patchwork of disconnected 
parts that undermine Palestinian hopes for a united homeland.
  The result has been a vicious cycle of violence. That is why, for 
years, I have advocated that U.S. military aid should help Israel and 
Palestine move toward peace, not subsidize policies that move peace 
further out of reach.
  Today, Netanyahu is doubling down on his opposition to peace. The 
Prime Minister has openly and directly rejected U.S. policy. He has 
promised he will not compromise and he will hold fast to his rejection 
of a Palestinian State.
  Under his leadership, the Knesset has backed him to the hilt. The 
Prime Minister has also tried to pressure Egypt and other countries in 
the region to accept Gazan war refugees, raising the specter that his 
government is working toward permanently expelling Palestinians from 
their homes. He has insisted that Israel and Israel alone must control 
the entire area of the Jordan River, leaving no room for a Palestinian 
State.
  And the fallout from his bombing campaigns is not limited to Gaza. He 
has given cover for Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other terrorist groups 
to expand the conflict.
  The bottom line is clear: Netanyahu's leadership in this war has been 
a moral and strategic failure that is in direct opposition to American 
policy and American values.
  Netanyahu cannot bomb his way to the return of the hostages. 
Netanyahu cannot bomb his way to security in the region. Netanyahu 
cannot bomb his way to peace.
  The only path to protect Israel's long-term security and to ensure 
that Palestinians have equal rights, equal freedom, and the self-
determination they deserve is a two-state solution--two states for two 
peoples.
  This has been the stated policy of the U.S. Government dating back 
decades, and if this far-right Israeli Government does not share that 
goal, then it is our responsibility to make clear that the Netanyahu 
government does not get a blank check for U.S. aid.
  That is why I have been fighting to condition aid to Israel and 
protect civilians in Gaza. Over the last few months, I have called for 
Israel to prevent harm to civilians and for accountability when U.S. 
weapons are used to target refugee camps and safe zones. I have 
challenged the administration's decision to bypass Congress in 
approving arms transfers to Israel. I have worked with my colleagues, 
led by Senator Van Hollen, on an amendment to condition aid to Israel.
  Earlier this month, President Biden delivered a critical step, 
issuing a national security memorandum that makes clear that any 
country that receives aid from the United States must follow 
international law, including Israel. This is a good policy, but 
enforcement is crucial. Oversight of its implementation is necessary to 
ensure that it is a meaningful step and not just lip service.
  Netanyahu has made clear he plans to launch a military offensive in 
Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians with nowhere safe to go 
are currently taking refuge. The administration has warned that 
expanding operations to Rafah would be a ``disaster'' that the U.S. 
Government does not support.
  Meanwhile, humanitarian aid remains strangled and hunger and disease 
are sweeping Gaza.
  Netanyahu is on dangerous ground. Every day that he continues, more 
innocent civilians in Gaza suffer and are killed, and thousands more 
Americans say ``enough'' and call on our government to end U.S. aid for 
such actions.
  President Biden has indicated that we are on the verge of a cease-
fire that would free the hostages and would allow desperately needed 
humanitarian aid in. I hope that is true, and it is a meaningful step 
toward an enduring peace.
  But until then, the United States has a responsibility to ensure that 
our weapons aren't used to target innocent children and families in 
Gaza. We also have a responsibility to ensure that our support is used 
to advance long-term peace and stability in the region.
  We recognize that it takes two parties to negotiate a meaningful 
peace, and we should also urge the allies of the Palestinians to do the 
same. All nations should push in the same direction: Condition aid, 
return the hostages, resume the cease-fire, and advance peace through a 
two-state solution.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.
  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, in the Hawaii 
Legislature, there was a common custom to ask the presiding officer 
that the previous speaker's remarks were adopted

as if they were my own. And although I didn't listen to the entirety--I 
am not prepared to do that because I only got the back end--I just 
wanted to commend the senior Senator from Massachusetts for her moral 
clarity about the conduct of the war in Israel and the fact that it is 
a strategic and moral failure, and that the Prime Minister of Israel 
must be held to account for the fact that so many people are suffering 
so unnecessarily."

Mr. President, every day we are reminded of the worsening 
humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Most of the infrastructure in the 
territory has been destroyed. Thousands of apartment buildings, 
schools, mosques, hospitals, shops, and markets have been reduced to 
piles of twisted metal and rubble, under which the bodies of an unknown 
number of people are buried.
  Of the world's many humanitarian crises, the situation in Gaza is 
among the worst. This is due in large measure to the onerous 
impediments by the Netanyahu government to the delivery of sufficient 
food, water, medicines, shelter, and fuel.
  Getting aid to those who are suffering and preventing starvation 
should be our most immediate and highest priority, along with obtaining 
the release of the hostages.
  As I said when I spoke out for a cease-fire in November, an immediate 
and indefinite cease-fire is the only way to achieve these goals. I am 
very heartened by Vice President Harris's call for an immediate--if 
temporary--cease-fire to get aid in and hostages out, because the 
reality is, the supply of lifesaving aid has dwindled to a trickle.
  Last week, the depth of the humanitarian emergency in Gaza exploded 
with the deaths of dozens of Palestinian civilians as they frantically 
tried to reach food supplies from aid trucks that were guarded by 
Israeli soldiers. People were trampled, people were run over by trucks, 
and they were shot.
  It was a horrifying scene and a direct result of the Netanyahu 
government's failure to put in place workable procedures for the 
delivery of sufficient aid to starving people. As others have said, 
there is no legal or security justification for restricting 
humanitarian aid to civilians who are caught in the middle of an armed 
conflict.
  The more desperate people become, the more chaotic and precarious the 
security situation, the more likely there will be other senseless 
tragedies just like this.
  I recently introduced a resolution, along with 15 of my colleagues, 
calling for the urgent delivery of sufficient humanitarian aid.
  The Biden administration has repeatedly called for greater access for 
more aid trucks to Gaza, but the number getting through remains far 
below prewar levels. And I am encouraged, nevertheless, that President 
Biden has directed the United States to begin airdropping aid in--a 
decision made with the understanding that, while not enough by any 
means, it could save lives.
  Israel now occupies Gaza. It has an obligation under international 
law--not to mention the moral responsibility--to feed and shelter 
Palestinians under its occupation.
  Beyond the moral imperative, the path to peace, security, and 
stability would be enhanced dramatically by facilitating the delivery 
of essentials for survival to the Palestinian people whose fate is 
imperiled. But as we saw last week, that is not happening.
  The Netanyahu government's rejection of U.S. and international 
appeals to meet the basic needs of innocent Palestinians trapped in 
Gaza and the resulting loss of innocent lives, is really the latest in 
a pattern that we have seen for years.
  The United States has long supported--and the United States will 
always support--Israel as a free and Jewish democratic state. But 
candor requires acknowledging that we have an ongoing, serious 
difference with Israeli leadership.
  It is the longstanding U.S. policy that the Middle East conflict can 
only be solved through negotiations to create two independent states of 
Israel and Palestine. President Biden has reaffirmed this.
  But Prime Minister Netanyahu has publicly rejected a two-state 
solution, and he has even credited himself for actively working to 
prevent the creation of a Palestinian state. I will use his words. He 
couldn't have been more clear. He said:

       I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over 
     the entire area in the west of Jordan--and this is contrary 
     to a Palestinian state.

  The United States opposes settlements and the destruction of 
Palestinian homes, orchards, schools, and other infrastructure in the 
West Bank. It violates international law and is a severe obstacle to 
peace. Secretary of State Blinken has reaffirmed this.
  Yet Prime Minister Netanyahu embraced the settlements. In 2017, he 
said:

       We will deepen our roots, build, strengthen and settle.

  In 2019, he said:

       With God's help we will extend Jewish sovereignty to all 
     the settlements as part of the land of Israel, as part of the 
     state of Israel.

  Under his leadership, settlements have expanded exponentially. 
Settlements bring extremist settler violence, some of it with firearms 
financed by American taxpayers.
  Shootings of West Bank Palestinians, threats laced with hateful 
messages that if they don't leave their homes, they will be killed, and 
the destruction of land and other property have surged--surged--in 
recent months, including, in some instances, with Israeli soldiers 
passively standing by and watching.
  It is the longstanding U.S. policy, codified by the Leahy law, that 
units of foreign security forces that violate human rights are not 
eligible for U.S. training or equipment or other assistance.
  And according to multiple reports, that law has not been applied to 
the Israeli Defense Forces, despite numerous cases of shootings of 
Palestinian civilians.
  We must face the contradiction of what we are doing. We are 
airdropping food to famine-stricken Gaza today and supplying bombs for 
Israel to drop on devastated Gaza tomorrow.
  We call for humanitarian relief, but how can that call be meaningful 
when aid workers are killed in their effort to deliver it and 
Palestinians are killed in their effort to retrieve it?
  It is time for us to acknowledge--all of us to acknowledge--what the 
entire world knows: It is impossible to deliver humanitarian aid in a 
very active war zone.
  Israel is a great country, Jewish and democratic. Israel has been--
and remains--our closest ally in the Middle East. For decades, Israel 
has been under attack by those who have sought to destroy it.
  President Biden--and so many of us--understand the history of Israel 
and the history of the Jewish people. October 7 was the worst attack on 
the Jewish people since the Holocaust. And we cannot ever let that 
happen again.
  But both of our countries right now are on a wrong path. Israel must 
stop its indiscriminate attacks that are killing so many Palestinian 
civilians--women and children, the majority among them who perished.
  And the United States must end its unconditional support when Israeli 
policies are wrong that are unjustified; that are causing so much 
suffering; and that, in the view of many of us, are doomed to fail in 
the goal of achieving lasting peace.
  How many times do we have to be repudiated by Prime Minister 
Netanyahu on the use of indiscriminate force; on the recklessness of 
expanding West Bank settlements; on impeding the delivery of aid; on 
advocating an endless Israeli post-conflict occupation of Gaza? How 
long and how often will Prime Minister Netanyahu reject our policies 
but take our money before we say, ``Enough''?
  How many more than the 30,000 Palestinians already killed and the 
70,000

[[Page S1101]]

wounded before we say to Prime Minister Netanyahu, ``Enough''? How many 
more homes and shops and schools and childcare centers and hospitals 
must be destroyed before we say to Prime Minister Netanyahu, 
``Enough''?
  Israel must--and Israel always will--make its own decisions as to who 
will be its political leaders. Israel must and Israel always will make 
its own decisions as to when and how to defend itself. It is their 
right.

  But the United States, too, must make its own decisions consistent 
with our values, with our judgment, and with what we believe to be in 
our national interest. The Biden administration has taken important 
steps to bring accountability through diplomacy by issuing a national 
security memorandum that builds on the Leahy law, but it is time for 
us--and I include all of us in the U.S. Congress--to stop accommodating 
the Netanyahu government. It has consistently shown it does not share 
our goal of achieving peaceful coexistence between the Israeli and 
Palestinian people.
  Our failure to act damages the authority, credibility, and reputation 
of the United States, not to mention our foreign policy and security 
interests. In my view, it undermines the security interests of Israel, 
which is increasingly isolated in the international community. 
Opposition to the disproportionate use of force in Gaza is widespread, 
including in our own country. So, too, regrettably, is the rise of 
anti-Semitism, which we must always condemn, and Islamophobia, 
likewise, which we must always condemn.
  It has been said many times before: U.S. aid is not a blank check. 
When it comes to the Netanyahu government, it has, for many years, 
across Democratic and Republican administrations, been a blank check. 
It is long past time for the United States to stop supporting by 
commission and omission actions that are inconsistent with our 
principles and our policies, and which make peace between Israelis and 
Palestinians ever more elusive, ever more difficult to achieve."

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to raise awareness of not only the 
desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza, but also, the fact that 
Israeli hostages that probably number over 100 have not been freed by 
Hamas.
  Every means at our disposal, including U.S. sea and airdrops, should 
be airlifted to get all necessary aid to civilian populations trapped 
and in dire need of supplies.
  I applaud the Biden administration's new mission to airdrop food and 
other aid directly into Gaza in collaboration with our Jordanian allies 
and in cooperation with Israeli forces.
  If our Nation could lead the Berlin airlift following World War II, 
surely we can ease the suffering as we urge a truce and work with our 
allies toward a two-state solution.
  I include in the Record a proposal for a negotiated truce and a two-
state solution that will allow for rebuilding.

 Guest Essay: Establishing `Gaza-Palestinian Protectorate' Would Go a 
                                Long Way

                      (By U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur)

       Halfway around the world, the war between Hamas' terrorist 
     units and Israel is a piercing global tragedy. It demands a 
     global response. Yet, ``Peace and Justice'' have eluded 
     solution in this troubled region for over a century. It will 
     be even harder to achieve after this conflagration ends. The 
     extraordinary death toll will resound for generations 
     forward. How does one create a lasting peace borne of such 
     fierce, enduring hatreds?
       The invasion Hamas' fighters launched from Palestinian Gaza 
     into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 broke the cease-fire that had 
     tensely hung over that very troubled region. More than 1,200 
     innocent Israeli civilians were slaughtered in a barbaric 
     attack, with more

[[Page H809]]

     than 100 Israeli and some American hostages still remaining 
     in captivity. More than 250,000 Israelis were evacuated and 
     displaced from their homes. In Gaza, 1.7 million Gazans have 
     subsequently been displaced with Hamas health officials 
     claiming more than 25,000 civilians dead, and more than 
     60,000 injured with two-thirds of the victims being women and 
     children.
       How does any army defeat a hostile enemy positioned amidst 
     a civilian population and underground in a vast ``bunker 
     city'' with miles of interconnected tunnels, dug for purposes 
     of war, not peace?
       Over 140,000 Hezbollah terrorist forces supplied by Iran, 
     are positioned in southern Lebanon, shooting rockets down on 
     Israel now. It is no accident Yemen's terrorist Houthi 
     adherents, also supplied by Iran, have been purposefully 
     shelling private cargo ships as well as targeting U.S. naval 
     vessels in the Red Sea to disrupt global trade in this 
     conflicted region. Russia's role in exacerbating resurgent 
     unrest was made clear when top Gen. Sergei Shoigu recently 
     visited Iran. And a Hamas delegation was in Moscow not long 
     after it attacked Israel.
       Across the Middle East, a spiderweb of terrorism is 
     hastening, hell-bent on evil. Iranian drones and missiles are 
     being used against Ukraine, Israel, the United States, and 
     our allies in Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, and Jordan. North Korean 
     missiles are likewise in use against Ukraine. The global 
     distinction between tyranny and liberty could not be clearer. 
     The world community of nations must not allow terrorist 
     forces enabled by Iran and Russia to foment unrest and 
     carnage. The sacred boundaries of nations must be respected, 
     defended, and enforced.
       The history of the Middle East instructs that former 
     adversarial nations can make peace among themselves. For 
     nearly five decades, dating back to my days of service in the 
     Carter administration, proposals for a two-State solution 
     have been advanced for Israel and Palestine.
       Ironically, the depth and brutality of this present 
     conflict may create an opening for a far-reaching solution. 
     If the world community could spend as much money on peace as 
     it has on war, both the Israelis and Palestinians could have 
     thriving homelands,
       To move forward, I propose that the United Nations, or a 
     coalition of willing nations, begin to negotiate a ``Gaza-
     Palestinian Protectorate.'' The parties involved should aim 
     to negotiate a long-lasting solution to the conflict in Gaza, 
     address challenges in the West Bank, and divide the contested 
     territory securing their existence with an International 
     Multilateral Security Force to separate warring factions.
       If the civilized world could achieve this with a divided 
     Korea, why not with Palestine and Israel?
       The goals of the Protectorate would be fourfold:
       1) an international coalition of nations should be 
     assembled and involved in organizing its administration and 
     staffing;
       2) Gaza would be demilitarized of weapons, war, tunnels, 
     and fortifications;
       3) Hamas would have no role, politically, administratively, 
     or economically;
       4) Palestinians from Gaza should be involved in the 
     administration of the Protectorate's on-site operations, 
     including its police forces.
       The Protectorate would have three immediate tasks. The 
     first would be to quickly secure resources and provide food, 
     water, shelter, and medical care to the almost 2.3 million 
     people of Gaza.
       The second is to provide an international military 
     coalition that can demilitarize Gaza as quickly as possible. 
     Gaza must never again be a threat to its neighbors.
       The third is to physically separate Gaza and Israel, by 
     creating a demilitarized zone between the two, that is 
     virtually impenetrable, as is the DMZ between North and South 
     Korea. As part of the separation, the infrastructure to 
     provide water, sewage treatment, and energy needed by Gaza 
     should be located in Gaza and staffed by the people of Gaza.
       One of the long-term missions could be to rebuild what is 
     now a destroyed area under a new vision of peace and 
     prosperity. Gaza has many undeveloped resources, the primary 
     of which is its land and location. While small in size, Gaza 
     is located in one of the most attractive parts of the 
     Mediterranean, with miles of undeveloped, beautiful beaches 
     that could become a recreational center of the region.
       With peace and stability, Gaza could become a financial and 
     economic hub that attracts capital and businesses from around 
     the world. Gaza and the West Bank have the thousands of 
     workers needed to rebuild what has been destroyed along with 
     necessary staff to renew the economy. A ``Gaza Development 
     Authority'' as part of the Protectorate could create and 
     administer a long-term development plan to bring prosperity 
     and transparency that would forestall the corruption that so 
     often accompanies unfettered development,
       Hope must arise from this cruel war. Old diplomacy, and old 
     solutions should be shelved. They should be replaced with a 
     forward-looking approach that could bring peace, justice, and 
     prosperity to this war-torn region. Succeeding would give 
     hope to a civilized world that hungers for peace in these 
     troubled lands.
  Ms. KAPTUR. The U.S. is prepared to continue airdrops if we can work 
with our allies to achieve it by sea or air. The world community can 
help.
  We have a moral obligation to achieve and to assure the release of 
hostages and sustainment of life for those who are innocent on the 
ground."

January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise; and I rise as a 
liberated Democrat, unbought, unbossed, and unafraid. I rise in the 
spirit of Shirley Chisholm, who coined the notion of being unbought, 
unbossed, and unafraid. I rise as a proud scion of the enslaved 
Africans whose lives were sacrificed for more than 240 years to make 
America great.
  Their lives were sacrificed because America at that time desired to 
have a caste system, a system wherein persons were born into this 
caste, would live, die, and be buried as a part of the caste. Not a 
class. Caste is hereditary. A class is a socioeconomic circumstance.
  There was this desire to have persons be a part of the caste, and 
persons of African ancestry were selected because they were 
identifiable, and they wanted an identifiable caste. They wanted this 
caste to be subservient, immediately agreeing to whatever the master 
said, and they wanted them to be powerless. They were exactly that: A 
powerless, subservient, identifiable caste for more than 240 years.
  Mr. Speaker, I still love my country, notwithstanding its history. I 
love it because I believe in the ideals that have been expressed in the 
Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Pledge of 
Allegiance. Those ideals give me hope. I believe that America still has 
much to achieve, but I believe that America can still dream big and 
accomplish great things. It is my hope that we will at some point 
achieve the ideals extolled in the Pledge of Allegiance--liberty and 
justice for all; the ideal of government by the people for the people; 
the notion that we can have a country wherein all persons are created 
equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. 
These are the things that I believe we can achieve.
  I believe that we ought to honor the persons who were enslaved. I 
honor victims of great, horrific tragedies. I honor the victims of the 
Holocaust. There is nothing to be compared to the Holocaust. There is 
nothing to be compared to the enslavement of millions of people for 240 
years. These are two horrific incidents in history, two circumstances.
  I believe that we ought to respect and acknowledge that the Holocaust 
occurred and that it has had an impact not only on the people of that 
time but on the people of this time.
  I also believe we ought to acknowledge that enslavement occurred. 
There are people who don't want to acknowledge slavery in this country. 
They want to say that it was involuntary relocation. This is a fact. 
Well, it wasn't. It was murder. It was rape. It was robbery. It was 
kidnapping. It was all of these horrific things, including lynching. It 
was an horrific, horrible circumstance that was imposed upon people.
  I think we should honor both the Holocaust and what we call slavery, 
the enslavement of persons of African ancestry, because these persons 
of African ancestry built the Capitol. We know of the great things that 
they did: built the roads, the bridges, planted the crops, harvested 
the crops, fed the Nation.
  They were the economic foundational mothers and fathers of the 
country. Why wouldn't we honor them, given the role that they played in 
making America great? For some reason, we can't find it in our hearts, 
it seems, to honor them; but we can find it within our hearts, as I 
have found it within my heart, to honor the victims of the Holocaust.
  Some people would ask why. Here is the reason why. I am glad you 
asked. It is easy to look through the window of life into someone 
else's horrific circumstances and condemn what happened. However, it is 
very difficult to look into the mirror of life, into our own 
circumstances, and acknowledge what happened. It is difficult for 
people who have suffered to do it.
  You would think that people who have suffered would be among the 
first to say we need to have a Slavery Remembrance Day, ought to be 
among the first to say, well, to give a Congressional Gold Medal to the 
enslaved persons, just as we have given a Congressional Gold Medal to 
the enslavers.

                              {time}  1130

  In 1956, this Congress of the United States of America that accorded 
a Congressional Gold Medal to Confederate soldiers won't do such a 
thing. This Congress will not honor the victims of slavery the same as 
we have honored Confederate soldiers who were the enslavers.
  Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to look into the mirror of life, but 
that is why I am here. I am here to help you see what you choose not to 
see and to do what you choose not to do. You may not do it today, but 
it will happen. It is just a matter of time. There will be more like me 
to require you to see what you choose not to see. It is just a matter 
of time.
  So, I am a proud scion. That means that I am a descendant of these 
people who had the injustice of enslavement perpetrated upon them and 
perpetuated for some 240 years. I am a descendant, but I like saying 
that I am a scion because it has more of a regal connotation. It says 
you are proud to be associated with your ancestors. It says you 
recognize what your ancestors have accomplished. It recognizes the 
greatness of your ancestors.
  Yes, I am a scion, but I am also the progenitor of August 20 as 
Slavery Remembrance Day. August 20 is the date that the White Lion 
docked at a place that we now call Norfolk, Virginia, near there, in 
Point Comfort. It had 20 persons of African ancestry on board, who were 
traded to the Colonies.

[[Page H1052]]

  This was the genesis of slavery in the Colonies. There had been 
slavery before that, but this was the genesis of slavery in the 
Colonies, which became a part of America.
  So, I am the progenitor of making Slavery Remembrance Day a day that 
is commemorated to the same extent that we commemorate the Holocaust--
two separate incidents, two separate circumstances, and two separate 
horrific occurrences in history. One we commemorate, and I do so 
proudly. The other, we would like to forget. We would like to just set 
it aside and not give those enslaved persons the just treatment that we 
would accord others.
  I want to see Slavery Remembrance Day commemorated across the length 
and breadth of this country, a day set aside to commemorate the more 
than 10 million lives that were forced into slavery, had it perpetrated 
upon them and perpetuated for some 240-plus years.
  We ought to commemorate their lives; therefore, I contend, we have 
and must have Slavery Remembrance Day.
  Now, President Biden has agreed with me and Senator Elizabeth Warren. 
The two of us have been working together. We had Slavery Remembrance 
Day pass in the House of Representatives. It hasn't passed in the 
Senate, but it passed in the House of Representatives.
  I will always say thanks to Mr. Steny Hoyer, who was at that time in 
a position to make a difference, and he did. Many people are in a 
position to make a difference, and they don't. Mr. Hoyer made a 
difference. I imagine he has been criticized for it.
  Mr. Hoyer, wherever you are, I assure you that posterity will see the 
kindness and the understanding that had to envelop you for you to do 
this, and I commend you for what you did. I know that history is going 
to be kind to you.
  The President acknowledged Slavery Remembrance Day with a communique, 
a press statement, if you will, and I am proud to know that he would do 
so. This President is a President whom I have great respect for, and I 
commend him for many things that he has done.
  Today, I want to commend him for his comments about the Palestinians 
and the suffering--the suffering--that is taking place in Palestine--
Gaza, if you will--but in Palestine to this very second as I am 
speaking now.
  I commend the President for having the courage. It takes courage to 
do what he did. It takes courage in an environment where Palestinians 
are not appreciated, not celebrated.
  In this House, we have passed resolutions, several of them, that have 
done things that I think should have been done related to what happened 
on October 7, what happened to persons who were living in Israel. I 
commend and appreciate the passage of those resolutions. I voted for 
resolutions to deal with the circumstances that occurred on October 7 
when the dastardly deeds were perpetrated by Hamas.
  Hamas is a terrorist organization. Hamas did things that we really 
don't care to talk about or discuss, but we have to acknowledge that 
there was murder, that there was rape, and that there were 
decapitations that took place. We have to acknowledge the truth. It 
happened by Hamas, so I have no kind things to say about Hamas. I have 
things to say about Israel, the Palestinians, and the President.
  Mr. President, I thank you for what you said. You said you wanted to 
help with the humanitarian crisis. You said that there would be a pier 
constructed such that food could be brought in to the Palestinians.
  I commend you for this, Mr. President. I think we should do this.
  Mr. President and Mr. Speaker, I have introduced a resolution 
affirming the state of Palestine's right to exist. I filed this 
resolution because a resolution was filed, H. Res. 888, reaffirming the 
State of Israel's right to exist. Israel has a right to exist. This is 
where I stand. I also stand on the solid, firm conviction that the 
state of Palestine has a right to exist.
  Yes, I said ``state.'' I know it is not a state currently by our 
traditional definition, but I believe that it has a right to exist as a 
state, and I have introduced a resolution affirming the state of 
Palestine's right to exist.
  I did it because I believe there ought to be some balance in the 
House of Representatives. I believe that there ought to be some people 
with the courage to say, ``I support the Palestinians,'' with the 
courage to say, ``Killing babies, knowingly killing babies, knowingly 
killing hundreds and thousands of babies, is an injustice.''
  You have to have the courage to say committing an injustice in the 
name of justice is still an injustice.
  Sometimes, you have to stand alone, but I have been taught and 
believe that, on some questions, it is better to stand alone than not 
stand at all. Hence, we have H. Res. 902, affirming the state of 
Palestine's right to exist.
  Mr. President, I believe a picture is worth a thousand words, and I 
want people to just see what we have as evidence of the suffering that 
is taking place in Palestine. This is a picture, an actual 
representation, of people in Palestine. You have two adults and two 
children. You see the babies.
  If you only see Palestinian babies, I would beg that you would open 
your eyes a little wider, clear your vision, and assume that these 
babies are babies from your hometown. Assume that these babies are 
babies from your neighborhood. Assume that these are Israelis. How 
would you feel if you saw this circumstance existing for Israelis?
  These circumstances are circumstances that are horrific. Babies and 
innocent people ought not be killed in the numbers that are being 
killed. It is an injustice. You cannot, in the name of justice, create 
an injustice. It still becomes and is an injustice.
  Here is another example of the horrific circumstances of devastation 
and destruction that exist. I just don't know that you can see enough 
of it to completely comprehend what has been destroyed. There are many 
estimates as to how much of Gaza has been destroyed. The pictures speak 
louder than the numbers. I called the numbers to our attention before.
  Here is a baby. This baby is a victim of the war in Gaza. This baby 
cannot be blamed for anything that Hamas has done. You can't allege 
that this baby is somehow associated with Hamas.
  Killing innocent babies is unacceptable. I refuse to allow people to 
convince me that you can kill babies and somehow conclude that it is 
okay because the babies were in the way. I refuse to accept it. Those 
who do, I would hope that you would understand that there are some of 
us who can't.
  Another picture is a depiction of Palestinians having to move out of 
harm's way and having to do so with what appears to be their 
belongings. There are children and a donkey-drawn, if you will, cart of 
some sort. There is no car, and they have to move from one end to 
another.
  Those living conditions are horrible. We have to do something about 
it, and I will tell you why in just a moment.
  Another picture, the final picture, is of a baby, another child. This 
child, hopefully, will grow up and, hopefully, will get the necessary 
help in terms of physical aid as well as mental aid. This child is 
going to need help, and I would hope that this child will get help.
  I would hope that this child doesn't become the next generation of 
persons who will find themselves at odds with the State of Israel. My 
hope is that there can be peace and two countries living together. That 
is my hope, and that is my prayer.
  To this end, I have written a letter to the President. It is a letter 
that I will share with you now that I sent to the President some time 
ago, on February 29.
  This is a letter to the President of the United States. The reference 
in the letter is: ``Justice and Mercy for Palestinians.''
  This letter is a letter that I put my thoughts into. I say this 
because I write my speeches. I write my letters of this magnitude. I 
don't want people blaming my staff for the things that I do. My staff 
are great people, and they assist, but these are my ideas and my 
thoughts.
  This is the letter:
  ``Justice and Mercy for Palestinians.''
  ``Dear President Biden, I pen this communique driven by the dictates 
of conscience and with a heavy heart--saddened by the deaths in 
Palestine and Israel, compounded by Prime Minister Netanyahu's recent 
indications that Israel will continue to oppose the unilateral 
recognition of a Palestinian

[[Page H1053]]

state and continue maintaining control over stateless Palestinians in 
lands intended for a Palestinian state. He further indicated that the 
recognition of a Palestinian state will be reached only through direct 
negotiations between the parties.''

                              {time}  1145

  Mr. Netanyahu, Prime Minister--I rarely say Netanyahu--I respect the 
position that he holds. He is a Prime Minister, a person with great 
authority, and his position seems to be that there has to be a 
negotiated recognition of a Palestinian state, that Israel and the 
Palestinians will have to negotiate and, once they come to a conclusion 
that there should be a Palestinian state, then we can recognize it.
  Then he goes on to say that the parties have to negotiate this, and 
it cannot be done unilaterally.
  Well, here is what I say to the President:
  ``Mr. President, on May 14, 1948, President Harry Truman became the 
first world leader to recognize Israel as a state within Palestine. . . 
. `'
  Some things bear repeating, phraseology that I use quite regularly 
because many things bear repeating:
  ``Mr. President, on May 14, 1948, President Harry Truman became the 
first world leader to recognize Israel as a state within Palestine, 
effectuating an imbalance of political influence for Israel.''
  Again, some things bear repeating:
  `` . . . effectuating an imbalance of political influence for Israel. 
This was done unilaterally. . . . `' That is what is in my letter. 
``This was done unilaterally without the consent of defiantly 
disapproving Palestinians. . . . `'
  The Palestinians did not approve of Israel becoming a state. It was 
done over their disapproval, many of whom were forcefully relocated.
  I go on to say:
  ``Mr. President, just as the Palestinians of 1948 were not allowed to 
thwart Israeli statehood, in the name of justice we should not allow 
Israel to thwart Palestinian statehood.''
  Sometimes silence can help us to collect our thoughts.

       Just as Palestinians of 1948 were not allowed to thwart 
     Israeli statehood, in the name of justice, Mr. President, we 
     should not allow Israel to thwart Palestinian statehood.

  Now we get to some very substantive commentary:

       This is particularly salient given that Prime Minister 
     Netanyahu obliquely opposed a two-state solution long before 
     October 7, 2023, long before the killing of innocent Israeli 
     men, women, and especially children.

  It is not in the letter, but as an aside, which was a horrific event, 
a day that will live in infamy along with other days that live in 
infamy.
  I go on to say:
  ``For years, Prime Minister Netanyahu has condoned Hamas' control of 
Gaza to maintain a foil for a lack of a negotiating partner. . . . `'
  By the way, this is no--this is not news. It has been reported on 
major networks that this occurred.
  ``For years, Prime Minister Netanyahu has condoned Hamas' control of 
Gaza to maintain a foil for a lack of a negotiating partner who 
recognized Israel's right to exist.''
  Mr. Netanyahu, Prime Minister Netanyahu, is a person that I respect 
in the sense that he is the leader of a nation. Prime Minister 
Netanyahu benefited from having Hamas in control of Gaza because he 
didn't have to negotiate a two-state solution. It was a means by which 
he could say the words two-state solution, but he didn't mean it. He 
didn't.
  The evidence is there for those who would see. However, there is a 
notion that there are some who are so blind, not because they cannot 
see, but because they choose not to see.
  Therefore, if you choose not to see, no one can make you see. You can 
remain in your state of darkness, but this is the truth. It has been 
widely reported.
  ``With Hamas,'' I go on to say, ``as a foil, Prime Minister Netanyahu 
feigned support for a two-state solution while enabling Israeli 
settlers to lay claim to land intended for a Palestinian state.''
  My God.
  Feigning, pretending to want to support a two-state solution while 
all along the way allowing, enabling settlers to lay claim to land 
intended for a Palestinian state.
  ``Mr. President, what President Truman did for Israel unilaterally in 
1948--'' I emphasize unilaterally because, remember, President 
Netanyahu says it can't be unilateral. Israel has to agree for the 
Palestinians to have a state. Israel has a state and has had a state 
since 1948. Palestinians are stateless.
  ``Mr. President, what President Truman--'' that first Mr. President 
is President Biden, if I may just substitute.

       President Biden, what President Truman did for Israel 
     unilaterally in 1948, we can do unilaterally for 
     Palestinians.

  Now, I am an avant-garde personality. I am usually out ahead of the 
rest of the pack. This is going to come to fruition. It is just a 
matter of time.
  When it does, the memory of this message will be clouded because 
there will be people chosen to bring the message when it is thought to 
be safe to bring the message. They will wait to see how safe it is for 
us to say these words and to come forth publicly and proclaim that 
there can be unilateral recognition.
  They have to wait, so I am the canary in the coal mine, and they will 
be waiting to see how I am reacted to, and that is being kind.
  I continue by saying:
  ``We should not allow a party feigning,'' pretending--that is 
parenthetically said.
  ``We should not allow a party feigning to negotiate in good faith to 
prevent our good faith, unilateral recognition of a Palestinian 
state.''
  If we are acting in good faith, if we know that the Palestinians 
deserve a state, yes, there will be an interregnum. While we are in 
that interregnum, there ought to be negotiations between people of good 
will who believe that there ought to be a Palestinian state, that the 
genesis of it is, to a certain extent, now, but that, when the full-
blown interregnum occurs, then we ought to make sure that we are on the 
right side, not just of history.

  It is a wonderful thing to be on the right side of history, but it is 
a better thing to be on the right side of righteousness, on the right 
side of saying: You don't kill babies in the tens of thousands and 
think you are doing the right thing.
  The right side of righteousness, you don't just decimate the homes 
and schools and churches, synagogues, and/or properties of people, 
mosques, if you will. You don't just decimate those things and say: We 
did it because it was a just thing to do.
  An injustice in the name of justice is still an injustice, so be on 
the right side of righteousness. Act in good faith, and let's develop a 
Palestinian state.
  Additionally, we don't have to do it with the consent of Prime 
Minister Netanyahu. We don't have to do it with his consent. President 
Truman didn't have anybody's consent. He was the President of the 
United States of America.
  Mr. President, I don't have to remind you who you are. You know. 
However, as the President of the United States of America, you don't 
need anybody's permission to recognize a Palestinian state, and you 
sure should not rely on the permission of Prime Minister Netanyahu, who 
has been feigning, pretending to want a two-state solution while 
enabling Hamas. There is a lot more to be said about that, and I will 
get to that in another message.
  I indicate in my letter to the President, lastly, in the name of 
mercy--mercy--I believe we must send tens of billions, not millions, of 
dollars in humanitarian aid to Palestine, to Gaza, to the West Bank. I 
believe we ought to send tens of billions, and I believe we have to be 
proud to say we are sending the money in humanitarian aid to people who 
need tens of billions in humanitarian aid.
  Now, pay particular attention to the words I am about to say--to 
people who need tens of billions of dollars in humanitarian aid because 
our fingerprints are all over what you have seen in these pictures. Our 
fingerprints are all over this. Our money has made this possible.
  We have a debt to righteousness. We ought to pay our debt to 
righteousness. Send tens of billions and be proud. It doesn't have to 
be hidden in some bill. You don't have to announce: Well, we are going 
to send money to Ukraine, which I supported; we are going to send money 
to Taiwan and the people in that area, Pacific Islanders, which I 
supported, but never say: We are going to send money to the 
Palestinians. We are going to send money to Israel, which I have 
supported.

[[Page H1054]]

  As a matter of fact, the number exceeds $50 billion that I have 
supported to Israel.
  Therefore, if we are going to say: We are going to send money to 
Ukraine and to Taiwan and to Israel, why can't we say: We want to send 
money to the people who are suffering this injustice, perpetrated by 
the Prime Minister of Israel, with dollars, tax dollars--tax dollars 
from American citizens and other persons in this country who pay 
taxes--sales taxes, gasoline taxes.
  These tax dollars--these tax dollars--I know it makes you 
uncomfortable, and you ought to be uncomfortable. These tax dollars 
have created this circumstance.
  Someone will say: Well, no, those tax dollars weren't used for that. 
They were used for other purposes. However, as my colleagues across the 
aisle like to remind me, there is something called fungibility.

                              {time}  1200

  These dollars are fungible. They make it possible if you have these 
dollars for one thing, then you can use your own dollars for other 
things.
  Hamas was wrong. They shouldn't have done what they did. They ought 
to be punished for what they did. They are being punished for what they 
did, but it is wrong for Mr. Netanyahu to kill tens of thousands--
babies, innocent men, women, and children, an injustice of horrific 
proportions.
  Some would say: Well, why wouldn't you expect Israel to do what it is 
doing? After all, Hamas did a dastardly thing.
  Well, I am one of those people who believes that Israel is special. I 
don't expect people who have suffered the Holocaust to impose this. I 
don't expect it. I expect them to understand that you don't do this. 
That is my expectation.
  I believe that we have a duty to ourselves to speak truth not only to 
power but about power. It is easy to speak truth to power.
  You say: Power, there is a problem. We need to solve it. It is 
difficult to say to power when you are speaking truth about it: Power, 
there is a problem, and you are it.
  Mr. Netanyahu, Prime Minister, there is a problem, and you are it. 
You have got to stop killing these babies. Silence can help you collect 
your thoughts. Stop it. Now.
  Lastly, I say in the name of mercy, I believe we must send tens of 
billions--not millions--of dollars in humanitarian aid to Palestine as 
our largesse to Israel has enabled the decimation of Gaza, as well as 
the estimated deaths of tens of thousands of innocent Palestinian men, 
women, and especially children.
  Now, if you can live with yourself and the knowledge that tens of 
thousands of innocent people are being killed, allow me to live with 
myself believing that it is an injustice. It is an injustice to do what 
is being done in the name of justice.
  I go on to close by saying in closing, I respectfully and kindly make 
this appeal in the name of justice and mercy for the thousands of 
innocent Palestinian men, women, and especially children who have been 
injured, killed, or had their homes destroyed with munitions bearing 
our fingerprints.
  This is my letter that I have sent to the President of the United 
States. I signed it as a Member of Congress, as the progenitor of 
August 20 as Slavery Remembrance Day, as a scion of the enslaved 
Africans sacrificed to make America great.
  I believe that the greatness of America will not be measured by the 
number of battleships that we have, the number of bombers, high-flying 
stealth technology.
  It won't be measured by the number of billionaires we produce. The 
greatness of America won't be measured by how we treat people who live 
in the suites of life and places where all is well.
  Dr. King mentioned to us--and I am paraphrasing--the truest measure 
of a person, and I would now add truest measure of a country, Dr. King, 
but he said: The truest measure of a person is not where you stand in 
times of comfort and convenience.
  He didn't say what I am about to say now. When all is well with you, 
when you are the leading country in the world, when you have 
billionaires and persons of great opulence doing well, it won't be 
measured by where you stand in times of comfort.
  The question that Dr. King mentions in his statement is: Where do you 
stand in times of challenge and controversy?
  His statement was: The truest measure of a person is not where do you 
stand in times of comfort and convenience, but where do you stand in 
times of challenge and controversy?
  In these times of challenge and controversy, the United States of 
America ought to stand for justice for all. That would include this 
baby.
  The United States of America ought to stand for liberty for all--
liberty and justice for all. That would include the Palestinian people.
  The truest measure of a Nation is not about the height of our 
buildings, not about the billionaires, but about where we stand when we 
have the opportunity to stand for righteousness--not just justice by 
righteousness.
  Here is our righteous call to the United States of America. This is 
it. Do not, do not, do not allow yourselves to succumb to the notion 
that the killing of these babies is a form of justice.
  It was my honor to be present last night when the President delivered 
his State of the Union Address. He said many things, but I have spoken 
to you about the thing that was important today.
  It doesn't mean that all of the other things that he said were not 
important. It does mean that I singled out something to talk about 
today, and I thank the President for what he said and for his belief 
that a two-state solution is the means by which we can achieve the 
ultimate peace that we seek in the area that we call Palestine wherein 
Israel now exists. By the way, I have said Israel has the right to 
exist.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time. I want to do what I 
customarily do when finish this, for those who are new to hearing Al 
Green speak and noticing.
  I always go over and shake the Speaker's hand. There is something to 
be said when you express your appreciation. I shall do so.
  I thank all of you for allowing me to share my thoughts with you. An 
injustice in the name of justice is still an injustice."

January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Green) for 30 minutes.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. And still I rise.
  I rise as a very proud unbought, unbossed, and unafraid liberated 
Democrat. In the spirit of Shirley Chisholm, she was, as she 
proclaimed, unbought and unbossed.
  I rise also as the scion of the enslaved Africans whose lives were 
sacrificed to make America great. I rise as the progenitor of Slavery 
Remembrance Day, August 20, Slavery Remembrance Day. All of these 
things are important to me because all of these things are associated 
with my history.
  So I rise today in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm. I rise to speak 
and address an issue that is little known to most persons. The issue 
has to do with domicide.
  Domicide. I will repeat this again in just a moment, but I think it 
will serve us well to articulate it at this moment. Domicide is the 
widespread or systematic destruction of homes, often during conflict.
  I will be saying more about it in just a moment.
  This is to whet your appetite, if you will, Mr. Speaker, to get you 
in the frame of mind such that you will start to give some thought to 
this word ``domicide,'' which more than likely you have not seen prior 
to today. Domicide is something that is new to most of us.
  In addressing this issue of domicide, I would like to read from an 
article published by NPR styled: ``What is `domicide,' and why has war 
in Gaza brought new attention to the term?''
  It is an article that was written by Becky Sullivan on February 9, 
2024, in NPR. These are the words of NPR:
  ``One of the most staggering statistics to emerge from the war 
between Israel and the militant group Hamas is this: More than 650,000 
residents of Gaza will have no home to return to once Israel completes 
its military campaign, the United Nations estimates.''
  Once Israel completes its military campaign, there will be no home to 
return to.
  According to NPR: That total amounts to nearly 30 percent of the 
territory's population. And `many more' will be unable to return home 
immediately due to damage to infrastructure and the danger of 
unexploded ordnance, the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, says.''
  It is disturbing to note that some 650,000 residents in an area that 
has approximately 2 million persons, a little more than 2 million, will 
have no home to return to, and it is indicated that

[[Page H1176]]

this will be the case once Israel completes its military campaign.
  Let me step aside from the article for just a moment and say this: 
What Hamas did on October 7 was unthinkable. It was a dastardly deed. 
It will live in the annals of history with those other dastardly deeds 
that we all regret having to recall to our minds. It was horrible, it 
was unthinkable, and it is horrific. This is what Hamas did, and Israel 
declared war on Hamas.
  Israel has a right to demand justice and to receive justice for the 
dastardly deeds perpetuated. Babies were killed, men and women were 
killed, and persons were decapitated.
  Israel has a right to seek justice.
  Israel declared war on Hamas.
  Israel did not declare war on Palestinians or Palestine.
  Israel did not declare war on the people of Palestine.
  In fact, Mr. Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, had indicated 
himself that the Palestinians are victims. The Palestinians are 
victims.
  Israel did not declare war on the Palestinians, but rather on Hamas.
  I say this repeatedly with the emphasis that I have attributed to 
these commentaries because there are many people who have confused 
Hamas with Palestine and Palestinians. Many people assume that because 
of what Hamas did, Palestinians can suffer and it is okay; many people 
have concluded.
  It is wrong to kill Israeli babies. It is wrong to kill innocent 
people in Israel.
  Be that as it may, many people have concluded that it is okay to kill 
Palestinian babies and innocent Palestinians.
  I am not one of them. I do not believe that in the name of justice 
you can commit an injustice and that injustice will be a justice. An 
injustice committed in the name of justice is still an injustice. What 
has happened to thousands of Palestinian babies in the course of this 
war on Hamas is an injustice.
  Let me continue. I have indicated that some 650,000 residents of Gaza 
will have no home to return to once Israel completes its military 
campaign. This is according to the United Nations. It also estimates: 
``That total amounts to nearly 30 percent of the territory's 
population. And `many more' will be unable to return home immediately 
due to damage to infrastructure.''
  Now, this is in addition to the 650,000. In addition to the 650,000, 
many more won't be able to return home due to damage to infrastructure 
and the danger of unexploded ordnance, the United Nation's Office for 
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA--I don't know how to 
pronounce it--OCHA says.
  ``As of early February, more than 70,000 housing units in Gaza have 
been destroyed and nearly 300,000 have been damaged. . . . `' This is 
according to the organization, OCHA, the one that coordinates the 
humanitarian affairs.
  It goes on to say here in the article: ``Taken together, it 
represents 60 percent of all housing units in the Gaza strip.'' That is 
60 percent of all housing units.
  ``Some researchers and human rights advocates say the destruction 
amounts to `domicide,'''--which I have called to your attention, 
domicide--``or the widespread or systematic destruction of homes, often 
during conflict.''

                              {time}  1130

  To a reader in a faraway place--this would apply to a lot of us.
  ``To a reader in a faraway place with no connection to a conflict, 
the numbers may feel abstract. But behind each of those numbers are 
families now experiencing the loss of their homes, said Ammar Azzouz, a 
research fellow at the University of Oxford and author of the book 
`Domicide: Architecture, War, and the Destruction of Home in Syria'.''
  ``This is the house of a family,'' he goes on to say, ``of the 
saving, the livelihood, the dreams, and the future of the people.'' 
This is what Azzouz said.
  Let me just elaborate for just a moment.
  This is the house of a family. Can you imagine your home being 
destroyed? You have done nothing wrong and your home is destroyed.
  He indicates that savings will be destroyed. Most people don't buy 
homes with cash; they have to save. In this country, they have a 
mortgage for some long period of time, perhaps 30 years, even more if 
you have to refinance for some reason.
  But this is your home and you invested your life savings to a certain 
extent in this home, so your savings are lost if your home is 
destroyed.
  The livelihood, this is a means by which people can make a living. 
Some people literally have home offices for various businesses that 
they are engaged in. Your home is a place that allows you to dream of 
better things, of better places, of better times; dreams about things 
that have happened to you and things that you plan to do.
  Your home provides you the opportunity to think big, dream big, and 
believe that there is a better opportunity in the future, but it is 
lost once your home is destroyed.
  It is the future of people. Homes have been the means by which people 
have been able to finance a child's education. Homes have been the 
means by which persons can start a small business with the equity that 
they have in the home. Homes have provided people with a future.
  He goes on to say, ``And when the world's gaze''--when the world's 
attention, if you will, when the world is no longer looking at Gaza and 
the Palestinians, he goes on to say, ``When the world's gaze moves on 
and forgets about what happened, this pain and suffering and rupture 
remains with the people for decades. . . . `'
  You don't lose your home, have your home blown away, bombed, 
destroyed, and just forget about it. It becomes a nightmare. Your dream 
becomes a nightmare. You will for years, decades, perhaps the rest of 
your life, remember that you lost your home and then you have to start 
all over again.
  If you are young, starting all over may be something that you can 
accomplish with a degree of ease, but many of these persons who are 
losing their homes in Gaza are not young. They are not starting all 
over as youngsters who have years ahead of them. Many of them are 
seeking a place to call home, shelter, if you will, in places that have 
been destroyed. Maybe there is a corner that they can move into and 
perhaps they can pull some cover over themselves at night. They bring 
their babies with them, their children with them as they move into 
these places to try to find shelter.
  Let's take a look at one possibility.
  This is a depiction of destruction in Gaza. You have two adults with 
children out front. I don't know that this is their home, if they were 
ever living in any of these areas that are represented in the picture, 
but this is a place where someone dwelled and, as you can see, it has 
been destroyed.
  This has to be painful when you realize that years of savings, years 
of building, and repairing all gone up with one bomb that has our 
fingerprints on it, by the way, because we have provided largesse to 
Israel.
  Some might say, well, maybe the money didn't go directly toward that 
bomb. Perhaps not. Perhaps not, but as my colleagues from across the 
aisle like to remind me, there is something called ``fungibility,'' 
meaning that moneys that are set aside for one thing, once you acquire 
some additional dollars, you can use that money for other things.
  We have our fingerprints on this destruction, and we ought to be 
concerned about the harm that it is going to cause not just in the near 
future but in the distant future, immediate harm, as well as long-term 
harm.
  I continue now with the NPR article. For fear that some may have 
missed the last paragraph, I will read it again. ``This is the house of 
a family, of the saving, the livelihood, the dreams and the future of 
people.''
  This is what Azzouz said, ``And when the world's gaze moves on,'' 
when the world is no longer paying attention, if you will, ``moves on 
and forgets about what's happened, this pain''--these are the persons 
who will experience the pain to a certain extent--``and suffering and 
rupture remains with people for decades, because this was their lost 
life, their lost time, and they grieve for it.''
  Your life is in your home. Your time is in your home. We have to 
start to think about what is happening to people now as a result of our 
largesse. Our largesse is permitting this kind of thing to happen to 
people that war has not been declared against.
  Remember, the war was declared against Hamas, not the Palestinians.

[[Page H1177]]

  Continuing with the NPR article. ``Domicide has come to be a feature 
of conflict in the Middle East''--this is what he said--``from Mosul in 
Iraq to Aleppo and Homs in his native Syria. Azzouz and others argue 
that this kind of destruction wreaks deep psychological damage on 
people.''
  Can you imagine how hurt you would be mentally if you have your home 
destroyed and you have done nothing wrong and you are innocent? Can you 
imagine how this pain lingers within your mind?
  He says it is ``deep psychological damage on people, for whom the 
loss of their home means a deeply felt loss of security.'' No home. You 
have lost your security. The home is a place where you feel secure. You 
lock your doors. You are there with your family. Everybody is in and 
you feel safe and secure. It remains a place of loss of security, of 
comfort, and memories.

  The memories of the children growing up and the many little things 
that happen in the home. The baby taking his first step in the room 
where, in some cases, the baby was born, unfortunately.
  Now, the article in NPR moves on to what the numbers show in Gaza.
  ``More than half of all buildings in Gaza have been damaged or 
destroyed as of February 2, according to analysis of satellite imagery 
by a team of researchers at Oregon State University.''
  This is NPR now quoting Oregon State University researchers as well 
as it says here, `` . . . the City University of New York. In northern 
Gaza, the most populous area of the territory before the war, as much 
as 82.9 percent of all buildings were damaged or destroyed.''
  This is in northern Gaza where people were told you have to move 
because the military is coming and you will be safe if you move to 
another area, which we have found not to be the case, by the way.
  Let's take a look at another picture.
  This is a representation. This is Gaza. I am not sure that it is 
northern Gaza, but if you look at the destruction here, you can see the 
lost dreams, the hopes, the security. The destruction is almost 
unimaginable. It is unimaginable in the sense that this is being 
perpetrated on innocent people.
  Here is an example of an innocent person, a young Palestinian child. 
Obviously, we should be concerned first about this child. The home and 
other tangible things are important, but first about this child.
  This child may have no home to return to. Notice I said may. I don't 
know this child's personal history, but may have no home to return to. 
This child is injured, suffering, may have no home to return to. If not 
this child, some child who has been injured will have no home to return 
to.
  And when you see this child, as I have begged in the past and I 
appeal to you now, don't just see a Palestinian child, see a human 
being, a human being that is suffering. See an Israeli child. See your 
own child, care, and have a heart. Understand that injustice in the 
name of justice is still injustice. This is an injustice.
  Many of the persons who had to leave their homes did not leave in the 
mode of transportation that would be familiar to us. Here is a family. 
They are having to vacate, and in so doing, they find themselves with 
what appears to be as much as they can carry on a cart that is being 
drawn with a donkey.
  They are already poor, already in poverty by standards that we 
recognize. They lost their home or are leaving their home. I don't know 
their personal history, so I can't say that these persons lost their 
home in the bombing, but I can tell you that somebody similar to these 
persons, if not these persons did, when the numbers that I called to 
your attention are as large as they are.
  So it may not be these persons, but it has been some people that have 
had to evacuate, had to vacate and move on because the bombs were 
coming, and they came.

                              {time}  1145

  Here is another picture of a child suffering. We can conclude that 
the child is suffering because the head is bandaged, and there is some 
sort of tube that has been inserted in the child's mouth.
  Suffering, I keep bringing this to your attention because we cannot 
allow the Palestinians to become just casualties of war. That is all--
just casualties of war.
  I refuse to allow Israelis to be casualties of war, innocent people, 
and I am going to stand for the Palestinians in the same vein as I 
stand for the Israelis. They are not just casualties of war. These are 
human beings.
  If this child survives, 10, 15, 20 years from now, what will the 
psychological impact of this be on that child? Some 20 years from now, 
how will this impact this child's behavior? Does anybody really care, 
or do we just want to bomb what we see as Gaza and Hamas into oblivion? 
Do we just want to bomb them into oblivion and, in the process, kill 
innocent babies?
  Nobody could claim that this baby was a part of Hamas. This baby 
looks to be not older than 3 or 4 years of age at most, probably. I am 
being generous in saying 3 or 4. This is a baby.
  We are the United States of America. We care about people. We are the 
country with the Statue of Liberty. We are the country with the words: 
All persons are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain 
inalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness.
  We are the country that pledges allegiance to a flag, and we announce 
as we do so that there should be liberty and justice for all.
  We are the United States of America. We cannot condone this. We 
cannot condone it. We cannot, in one breath, condemn the killing of 
innocent Israelis, innocent babies in Israel, and then condone this, 
find some way in our minds to justify that it is okay for this to 
occur.
  If you hurt an Israeli baby, you have done something dastardly. Well, 
this is a baby, too. For those who believe in the right to life, does 
this child have a right to life? I say yes.
  Continuing, an NPR article, not Al Green. This is from NPR, published 
on February 9, 2024, written by Becky Sullivan. This is NPR:
  ``More than half of all buildings in Gaza have been damaged or 
destroyed as of February 2, according to analysis of satellite imagery 
by a team of researchers at Oregon State University and the City 
University of New York. In northern Gaza, the most populous area of the 
territory before the war, as much as 82.9 percent of all buildings were 
damaged or destroyed.
  ``Israel's military says its strikes in response to October 7, when 
Hamas militants attacked Israel and killed 1,200 people. . . . `'
  Let me just stop. I am going to finish the sentence, but I have to 
say this. ``Killed'' is too polite a word for what Hamas did. It really 
is. When you decapitate people, ``killed'' is not the word that we can 
use, and ``decapitation'' is too polite. These are words for polite 
society.
  What they did was something that human beings ought not have to 
witness.
  Let me conclude with this. Friends, we have to care because we have 
our fingerprints on these issues, and I only pray and hope that we will 
do something to help the people of Palestine.
  Humanitarian aid is absolutely necessary, and I pray that the country 
that provided the largesse that made much of this possible will be the 
same country to provide the humanitarian aid to help the people of 
Palestine who are suffering immeasurable harm."

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, during his State of the Union 
Address last week, President Biden once again rightly pointed out that 
Israel has the right and I would say the duty to defend itself in the 
aftermath of the brutal Hamas terror attack of October 7 that left 
approximately 1,200 brutally murdered and 240 taken hostage. There must 
be no more October 7s.
  President Biden also described the ongoing humanitarian disaster 
taking place in Gaza today. Over 31,000 Palestinians have been killed--
over two-thirds of them women and children--and likely thousands more 
unaccounted for, buried beneath the rubble. Gaza has become a hellhole 
of human suffering. Humanitarian organizations that have operated 
worldwide for decades say they have never witnessed a more terrible 
situation.
  Among those suffering in Gaza are not only over 2 million innocent 
Palestinian civilians but also over 130 hostages still held by Hamas, 
including Americans.
  Earlier this week, I met with some of the families of Israeli 
hostages whose loved ones were kidnapped and are still being held 
captive, as well as one brave woman who was held hostage and released 
during the November pause.
  Every day that they are separated from their loved ones, not knowing 
what will happen to them next, is a day of unimaginable mental anguish 
and torment. That is why we must prioritize the release of the hostages 
and end the suffering of Palestinian civilians. The only way to do that 
is to secure an immediate cease-fire and release all of the remaining 
hostages. That must happen, but until it happens, we must do everything 
in our power to protect innocent civilians and end the humanitarian 
disaster in Gaza.
  Today, four out of five of the hungriest people on Earth are in Gaza. 
Hundreds of thousands of them are on the verge of starvation, and over 
23 children have crossed that grisly threshold and have died of 
starvation. Cindy McCain, the Director of the World Food Programme, has 
warned of an imminent famine. Injured children are having their limbs 
amputated without anesthesia. Sewage is spilling onto the streets, and 
humanitarian officials are seeing spikes in the spread of various 
preventable diseases, like diarrhea, among children.
  Two weeks ago, the world got a glimpse of a horrible scene: Over 100 
starving Palestinians were killed as they reached for food from trucks. 
In the aftermath of that horrible event, President Biden has ordered 
airdrops of food supplies. I support that decision because when people 
are starving, every parcel of food counts. But airdrops are just a drop 
in the ocean of need, so I was also glad to see the President order the 
building of a temporary port to help deliver more aid by ship. But that 
port will likely not be ready for at least 60 days, and even then, it 
will not be sufficient to meet the humanitarian need.
  All of these extraordinary efforts to deliver aid by air and by sea 
are being undertaken when we know that during the prewar period, when 
there was already a near blockade of Gaza, about 500 trucks still 
crossed daily through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza. And those 
500 trucks crossed every day when the need was far less acute than it 
is right now.

  So the obvious question is, Why? Why in the world should we have to 
resort to these extraordinary and more expensive means to deliver 
insufficient amounts of food and aid by air and sea when we could bring 
in sufficient amounts of food and aid by truck much more efficiently 
through Egypt's Rafah crossing and the multiple crossing points into 
Gaza from Israel?
  The answer is because this is a man-made disaster.
  The starvation in Gaza is not the result of food scarcity caused by 
drought or other natural disasters that we see in many parts of the 
world. This has been caused primarily because the Netanyahu government 
has used a series of tactics to restrict the amount of aid entering 
into Gaza. Anyone with eyes to see or ears to hear knows that.
  Members of the Netanyahu government, like Smotrich and Ben-Gvir,

[[Page S2388]]

have made no secret of their intentions. In October, after the war 
began, Ben-Gvir said:

       So long as Hamas does not release the hostages, the only 
     thing that should enter Gaza is hundreds of tons of Air Force 
     explosives--not one ounce of humanitarian aid.

  Smotrich used his power as Finance Minister to block a shipment of 
flour that could feed 1.1 million people for a month in Gaza. The 
shipment was finally released 2 days ago after having been blocked for 
5 weeks at least, all while people were starving.
  At one point, Prime Minister Netanyahu said his government was 
allowing just the ``minimum'' amount needed, and that was at a time 
when he and others denied that there was even a humanitarian disaster 
in Gaza; denied that there was a scarcity of food in Gaza; denied that 
there was hunger in Gaza.
  This is why President Biden has called out those restrictions and why 
he said in his State of the Union Address:

       Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration 
     or a bargaining chip.

  The President said that his administration is going to ``insist that 
Israel facilitate more trucks and more routes to get more and more 
people the help they need--no excuses.''
  More than 5 weeks ago, on February 2, 25 Senators sent a letter to 
President Biden, calling for the Netanyahu government to implement five 
specific actions to significantly increase the amount of humanitarian 
aid entering Gaza. To date, none of them have been fully implemented.
  That is why many of us have called on President Biden to immediately 
invoke and implement the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act, which is 
section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act. Now that NSM--National 
Security Memorandum--20 is in place, which is based on an amendment 
that 19 of us proposed to the National Security Act, it is essential--
essential--that the Biden administration enforce its terms to get 
humanitarian aid delivered where it needs to go. When people are 
starving, patience is not a virtue.
  It needs to be said that getting humanitarian aid into Gaza is only 
half the battle. The other half and the more dangerous half is 
distributing the aid once it is inside of Gaza. It doesn't do any good 
if you can't safely transport the food to the people who are starving. 
In other words, you need a safe distribution system for aid inside 
Gaza. Now, the organization that is the primary distributor of 
assistance within Gaza has been an entity called the United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency, known by its shorthand as UNRWA. Americans may 
have not heard much about UNRWA, so I want to say a little bit about 
why UNRWA exists and what it does in Gaza and elsewhere. But before I 
do that, I want to jump to why this is a pressing issue right now.
  The future of UNRWA is an urgent matter right now because Prime 
Minister Netanyahu and his extreme rightwing allies want to get rid of 
it not just in Gaza but everywhere that it operates. And guess what. 
Prime Minister Netanyahu and folks on the far right in his government 
have wanted to abolish UNRWA not just since October 7 but since at 
least 2017. In fact, in 2018, Prime Minister Netanyahu actually changed 
official Israeli policy with respect to UNRWA, saying that they wanted 
to cut off all funding to UNRWA, even at a time that his security team 
warned that it could create instabilities throughout the region if that 
happened.
  Now we have Republican Members of the House and Senate who are 
jumping on this bandwagon and saying they want to abolish UNRWA. And 
how do they want to do this? By inserting a provision in the State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bill, which is 
being considered and debated right now as we gather here, to cut off 
all U.S. funding for UNRWA. That is what they want to do.
  So let's go back to why UNRWA was created in the first place.
  In 1949--a year after the establishment of the State of Israel--the 
United Nations formed a new agency to provide vital services for over 
700,000 Palestinian refugees who were displaced during the first Arab-
Israeli war. Back then, the idea was that UNRWA would provide services 
to Palestinian refugees until a just and durable solution to their 
plight was found. As we know all too well, over 73 years have passed 
without a resolution to that conflict, which is why UNRWA's mission 
remains essential. Among other services, UNRWA provides schools and 
primary health services to Palestinian refugees and their descendants 
in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, and in Gaza.
  I hope we all agree that the Palestinian people deserve to live in 
dignity. The way to do that is to ensure that they also have self-
determination in a homeland of their own, just like every Israeli 
deserves dignity and self-determination in the Jewish and democratic 
State of Israel.
  President Biden and I and many others believe that the only viable, 
long-term solution to this conflict is a two-state solution, and 
President Biden has put that idea forward as the best way to create 
some light at the end of this very dark tunnel. UNRWA was really 
intended to be a bridge until such a resolution was reached.

  Prime Minister Netanyahu has stated very clearly that he is opposed 
to a two-state solution. He was opposed to the Oslo Accords, and he has 
been a severe opponent of the two-state solution. And as I said 
earlier, he also wants to eliminate UNRWA, which today is an 
organization of over 300,000 employees providing services to 
Palestinians in three countries and, as I said, also in the West Bank 
and Gaza.
  Mr. President, 13,000 of those 30,000 UNRWA staff operate in Gaza--
many of them as teachers. Since the war started with the brutal Hamas 
attacks on Israel of October 7, UNRWA's schools in Gaza have shut down; 
and as a United Nations agency, it has deployed its resources to supply 
humanitarian relief to the civilian population there. It is the main 
vehicle for distributing humanitarian assistance in Gaza. It won't do 
any good to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza if you dismantle the 
U.N. organization principally responsible for delivering that aid to 
people in Gaza.
  This morning, I met with chef Jose Andres, and I applaud him for his 
efforts and the efforts of the World Central Kitchen around the world, 
including in Israel and in Gaza. He said:

       Support for UNRWA is vital. If you want to feed people you 
     need to support UNRWA.

  We may have a temporary port, but when the ship gets to the port, 
someone has to transfer that food and other assistance from the ship to 
the people who need it in Gaza, and UNRWA is the principal distributor 
of assistance. If you talk to the World Food Programme and others, they 
say very clearly they cannot replace that capacity that UNRWA has.
  In late January, the Netanyahu government alleged that up to 14 of 
UNRWA's 13,000 employees participated in the horrific October attacks 
against Israel. These are, of course, very serious allegations, and 
UNRWA has taken them seriously. All agree that any individuals involved 
in that horror must be held accountable, and even though the Netanyahu 
government has not provided UNRWA with the underlying evidence, UNRWA 
immediately fired the alleged perpetrators.
  The U.N. Secretary General also took swift action and announced the 
launch of a full and independent investigation, led by the U.N.'s 
highest investigative body, into the allegations; and that is ongoing. 
At the same time, President Biden suspended all U.S. contributions to 
UNRWA pending the outcome of that investigation. A number of other 
countries followed suit, as did the EU.
  But, since then, two things have changed. First, the Netanyahu 
government has not shared the underlying evidence with UNRWA nor, as 
reported by The Wall Street Journal, has it shared the raw evidence 
with the United States. In fact, I urge every one of my Senate 
colleagues to read the classified report prepared by the DNI, and I 
especially urge my colleagues to read the intelligence assessments 
about the many other claims the Netanyahu government has made against 
UNRWA--and there have been many. I am sure that many of my colleagues 
are unaware of the fact that UNRWA has long provided both Israel and 
the United States with the names and identities of all its employees 
for full review and vetting. Now, Israel, of course, has far more 
extensive intelligence capabilities than UNRWA; but, apparently, they 
have never previously raised complaints about any of the

[[Page S2389]]

UNRWA employees on the lists given to them.
  Second, the EU and many countries that initially suspended their 
financial support for UNRWA have since restored their contributions 
because they have acknowledged the desperation in Gaza and the 
irreplaceable nature of UNRWA. In fact, even prior to these 
allegations, UNRWA had asked the U.N. Secretary General to convene an 
Independent Review Group to assess whether UNRWA was doing everything 
within its power to ensure neutrality.
  So, again, UNRWA in Gaza--an organization with a staff of 13,000 
people--is delivering essential life-sustaining aid to over 2 million 
people. And what the EU and these other countries that have restored 
UNRWA funding recognize is that it is inhumane to cut off assistance to 
2 million people because of the atrocious, alleged acts of 14. Punish 
the 14. Don't punish 2 million innocent Gazans, and that is why I 
believe that President Biden should restore this assistance now.
  The notion that UNRWA is, somehow, a front group for Hamas is a total 
lie--pure and simple. The individual dispatched by President Biden to 
be the U.S. humanitarian coordinator in the region is a veteran 
diplomat, Ambassador David Satterfield. He has repeatedly debunked 
claims made by members of the Netanyahu government that humanitarian 
aid provided by UNRWA has been diverted to Hamas. Specifically, he said 
the following:

       I have not received any allegations, evidence or reports of 
     any incidence of Hamas diversion or theft of U.S. or other 
     assistance or fuel from UN delivered assistance from any of 
     our partners or from the Government of Israel since the 
     humanitarian assistance resumed in Gaza October 21.

  Not a single report from Israeli Government officials or anybody else 
about Hamas diverting aid that was being transported by UNRWA or other 
U.N. agencies.
  My colleagues, you should all know that the individual overseeing 
operations on the ground in Gaza today is an American named Scott 
Anderson. He is a 21-year Army veteran from South Dakota. He is a no-
nonsense guy. I urge every Senator to talk to him. The notion that 
Scott Anderson is part of a front organization for Hamas is patently 
absurd.
  The truth is that before the war started, Prime Minister Netanyahu 
did not pretend that he wanted to dismantle UNRWA on the grounds that 
it was a proxy for Hamas. He has long wanted to eliminate UNRWA not 
only in Gaza but everywhere else that it supports education for 
Palestinian schoolchildren and healthcare for Palestinians, like in the 
West Bank and Jordan. As I said, he has been trying to do that since at 
least the year 2017. And now he has Republicans in Congress joining him 
and calling for the defunding of all U.S. support for UNRWA, not only 
in Gaza but throughout the region.
  Attempts to discredit UNRWA and the U.N. have gotten so bad that 18 
heads of all the major U.N. humanitarian and refugee agencies, together 
with NGOs like Save the Children and CARE, signed a statement calling 
for a ``halt to campaigns that seek to discredit the United Nations and 
non-governmental organizations doing their best to save lives.'' It is 
making it harder for them to save lives.
  If you want to take a combustible situation in the West Bank and make 
it even worse, then close down schools for kids there. Take away any 
chance of an education. Snuff out any hopes they may have for a 
brighter future. Really?
  If you want to create instability in Jordan, shut down UNRWA schools 
and services there. Why do we all think that King Abdallah has warned 
us about the consequences of shutting down UNRWA?
  Here is the crazy thing about this moment: Prime Minister Netanyahu 
has seized on the lies about UNRWA being a proxy for Hamas in Gaza to 
achieve his long-term goal of shutting down UNRWA everywhere.
  And what adds insult to injury is that UNRWA has not perpetuated 
Hamas in Gaza, but Prime Minister Netanyahu himself has done exactly 
that. Let me explain.
  You know, there is a lot of talk here in the U.S. Senate about the 
malign actors who have supported Hamas over the years. One of them is a 
very malign actor, Iran.
  Now, Iran did not create Hamas, nor does Iran exercise command and 
control over Hamas. But it does support Hamas because, like Iran, Hamas 
has the despicable goal of eliminating Israel. That is why Iran has 
supported Hamas.
  But what we rarely, if ever, discuss is the inconvenient truth that, 
until the unexpected horror of the Hamas attack on October 7, Prime 
Minister Netanyahu himself saw it as in his interest to keep Hamas in 
control in Gaza.
  Don't take my word for it. He told us in his own words back in 2019 
at a Likud Party meeting where he said:

       Anyone who wants to prevent the creation of a Palestinian 
     state needs to support strengthening Hamas. This is part of 
     our strategy to divide the Palestinians between those in Gaza 
     and those in Judea and Samaria.

  Prime Minister Netanyahu:

       Anyone who wants to prevent the creation of a Palestinian 
     state needs to support strengthening Hamas.

  Mr. President, I would like to have printed in the Record a piece 
that appeared in Haaretz, in October of last year, entitled ``A Brief 
History of the Netanyahu-Hamas Alliance.'' I ask unanimous consent that 
it be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                   [From the Haaretz, Oct. 20, 2023]

            A Brief History of the Netanyahu-Hamas Alliance

                             (By Adam Raz)

       For 14 years, Netanyahu's policy was to keep Hamas in 
     power; the pogrom of October 7, 2023, helps the Israeli prime 
     minister preserve his own rule.
       Much ink has been spilled describing the longtime 
     relationship--rather, alliance--between Benjamin Netanyahu 
     and Hamas. And still, the very fact that there has been close 
     cooperation between the Israeli prime minister (with the 
     support of many on the right) and the fundamentalist 
     organization seemingly evaporated from most of the current 
     analyses--everyone's talking about ``failures,'' ``mistakes'' 
     and ``contzeptziot'' (fixed conceptions). Given this, there 
     is a need not only to review the history of cooperation but 
     also to conclude unequivocally: The pogrom of October 7, 
     2023, helps Netanyahu, and not for the first time, to 
     preserve his rule, certainly in the short term.
       The MO of Netanyahu's policy since his return to the Prime 
     Minister's Office in 2009 has and continues to be, on the one 
     hand, bolstering the rule of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and, on 
     the other, weakening the Palestinian Authority.
       His return to power was accompanied by a complete 
     turnaround from the policy of his predecessor, Ehud Olmert, 
     who sought to end the conflict through a peace treaty with 
     the most moderate Palestinian leader--PA President Mahmoud 
     Abbas.
       For the last 14 years, while implementing a divide-and-
     conquer policy vis-a-vis the West Bank and Gaza, ``Abu Yair'' 
     (``Yair's father,'' in Arabic, as Netanyahu called himself 
     while campaigning in the Arab community before one recent 
     election) has resisted any attempt, military or diplomatic, 
     that might bring an end to the Hamas regime.
       In practice, since the Cast Lead operation in late 2008 and 
     early 2009, during the Olmert era, Hamas' rule has not faced 
     any genuine military threat. On the contrary: The group has 
     been supported by the Israeli prime minister, and funded with 
     his assistance.
       When Netanyahu declared in April 2019, as he has after 
     every other round of fighting, that ``we have restored 
     deterrence with Hamas'' and that ``we have blocked the main 
     supply routes,'' he was lying through his teeth.
       For over a decade, Netanyahu has lent a hand, in various 
     ways, to the growing military and political power of Hamas. 
     Netanyahu is the one who turned Hamas from a terror 
     organization with few resources into a semi-state body.
       Releasing Palestinian prisoners, allowing cash transfers, 
     as the Qatari envoy comes and goes to Gaza as he pleases, 
     agreeing to the import of a broad array of goods, 
     construction materials in particular, with the knowledge that 
     much of the material will be designated for terrorism and not 
     for building civilian infrastructure, increasing the number 
     of work permits in Israel for Palestinian workers from Gaza, 
     and more. All these developments created symbiosis between 
     the flowering of fundamentalist terrorism and preservation of 
     Netanyahu's rule.
       Take note: It would be a mistake to assume that Netanyahu 
     thought about the well-being of the poor and oppressed 
     Gazans--who are also victims of Hamas--when allowing the 
     transfer of funds (some of which, as noted, didn't go to 
     building infrastructure but rather military armament). His 
     goal was to hurt Abbas and prevent division of the Land of 
     Israel into two states.
       It's important to remember that without those funds from 
     Qatar (and Iran), Hamas would not have had the money to 
     maintain

[[Page S2390]]

     its reign of terror, and its regime would have been dependent 
     on restraint.
       In practice, the injection of cash (as opposed to bank 
     deposits, which are far more accountable) from Qatar, a 
     practice that Netanyahu supported and approved, has served to 
     strengthen the military arm of Hamas since 2012.
       Thus, Netanyahu indirectly funded Hamas after Abbas decided 
     to stop providing it with funds that he knew would end up 
     being used for terrorism against him, his policies and his 
     people. It's important not to ignore that Hamas used this 
     money to buy the means through which Israelis have been 
     murdered for years.

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. After all, so long as Hamas was in control in Gaza, 
how could anyone ask Israel to accept a Palestinian State that included 
Gaza and the West Bank? It is a fair question.
  So what are some of the ways in which Prime Minister Netanyahu has 
enabled Hamas to maintain its control in Gaza? Well, another thing we 
have heard a lot about around here is the money from Qatar that went to 
Hamas. It is well established that every penny of that money flowed 
from Qatar to Hamas with the concurrence of Prime Minister Netanyahu 
and Israel. That has been the testimony of witnesses in both the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee and the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee. It has also been well documented in numerous news sources.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record 
a CNN article entitled ``Qatar sends millions to Gaza for years--with 
Israel's backing.''

 Qatar sent millions to Gaza for Years--with Israel's Backing. Here's 
               What We Know About the Controversial Deal

(By Nima Elbagir, Barbara Arvanitidies, Alex Platt, Raja Razek, Nadeen 
                         Ebrahim, and Uri Blau)

       Since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, the Gulf state 
     of Qatar has come under fire by Israeli officials, American 
     politicians and media outlets for sending hundreds of 
     millions of dollars in aid to Gaza, which is governed by the 
     Palestinian militant group. But all that happened with 
     Israel's blessing.
       In a series of interviews with key Israeli players 
     conducted in collaboration with Israeli investigative 
     journalism organization Shomrim, CNN was told Prime Minister 
     Benjamin Netanyahu continued the cash flow to Hamas, despite 
     concerns raised from within his own government.
       Qatar has vowed not to stop those payments. Qatari minister 
     of state for foreign affairs Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-
     Khulaifi told CNN's Becky Anderson on Monday that his 
     government will continue to make payments to Gaza to support 
     the enclave, as it has been doing for years.
       ``We're not going to change our mandate. Our mandate is our 
     continuous help and support for our brothers and sisters of 
     Palestine. We will continue to do it systematically as we did 
     it before,'' Al-Khulaifi said.
       Israeli sources responded by pointing out that successive 
     governments had facilitated the transfer of money to Gaza for 
     humanitarian reasons and that Netanyahu had acted decisively 
     against Hamas after the October 7 attacks.
       Here's what we know about those payments and Israel's role 
     in facilitating them.


                  when did the qatari payments start?

       In 2018, Qatar began making monthly payments to the Gaza 
     Strip. Some $15 million were sent into Gaza in cash-filled 
     suitcases--delivered by the Qataris through Israeli territory 
     after months of negotiation with Israel.
       The payments started after the Palestinian Authority (PA), 
     the Palestinian government in the Israeli occupied West Bank 
     that is a rival of Hamas, decided to cut salaries of 
     government employees in Gaza in 2017, an Israeli government 
     source with knowledge of the matter told CNN at the time.


          what did israel know about hamas' october 7 attack?

       The PA opposed the Qatari funding at the time, which Hamas 
     said was meant for the payment of public salaries as well as 
     medical purposes.
       Israel approved the deal in a security cabinet meeting in 
     August 2018, when Netanyahu was serving his previous tenure 
     as premier.
       Even then, Netanyahu was criticized by his coalition 
     partners for the deal and for being too soft on Hamas.
       The prime minister defended the initiative at the time, 
     saying the deal was made ``in coordination with security 
     experts to return calm to (Israeli) villages of the south, 
     but also to prevent a humanitarian disaster (in Gaza).''
       Ahmad Majdalani, an Executive Committee member at the 
     Palestine Liberation Organization in the West Bank, accused 
     the United States of orchestrating the payment.
       The US was aware of the Qatari payments to Hamas, a former 
     senior State Department official involved in the region told 
     CNN on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the 
     matter.
       Qatar was prepared to provide funds to the Gaza Strip 
     through Hamas as early as the 2014 Israel-Hamas war to 
     alleviate the humanitarian crisis there, the official said, 
     and the US at the time left it up to the Israelis to decide 
     whether they would permit this.
       ``We deferred completely to the Israelis as to whether this 
     was something they wanted to do or not,'' the official said.


                   Why did Israel back the payments?

       Israeli and international media have reported that 
     Netanyahu's plan to continue allowing aid to reach Gaza 
     through Qatar was in the hope that it might make Hamas an 
     effective counterweight to the PA and prevent the 
     establishment of a Palestinian state.
       PA officials said at the time the cash transfers encouraged 
     division between Palestinian factions.
       Major General Amos Gilad, a former senior Israeli Defense 
     Ministry official, told CNN the plan was backed by the prime 
     minister, but not by the Israeli intelligence community. 
     There was also some belief that it would ``weaken Palestinian 
     sovereignty,'' he said. There was also an illusion, he added, 
     that ``if you fed them (Hamas) with money, they would be 
     tamed.''
       Shlomo Brom, a former deputy to Israel's national security 
     adviser, told the New York Times that an empowered Hamas 
     helped Netanyahu avoid negotiating over a Palestinian state, 
     saying the division of the Palestinians helped him make the 
     case that he had no partner for peace in the Palestinians, 
     thus avoiding pressure for peace talks that could lead to the 
     establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
       The former State Department official said that after the 
     2014 war, Israel felt it was better off with Hamas 
     controlling Gaza as opposed to multiple Islamist groups, or 
     leaving it in a political vacuum.
       ``It was our impression that the Israelis were comfortable 
     with keeping Hamas in power in a weakened form,'' the 
     official said. ``Our understanding was that Hamas was the 
     lesser of a whole bunch of bad options in Gaza,'' the 
     official added, noting that at least the competing PA could 
     keep Hamas out of the West Bank.

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have

     `Buying Quiet': Inside the Israeli Plan That Propped Up Hamas

                  (By Mark Mazzetti and Ronen Bergman)

       Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gambled that a strong 
     Hamas (but not too strong) would keep the peace and reduce 
     pressure for a Palestinian state.
       Just weeks before Hamas launched the deadly Oct. 7 attacks 
     on Israel, the head of Mossad arrived in Doha, Qatar, for a 
     meeting with Qatari officials.
       For years, the Qatari government had been sending millions 
     of dollars a month into the Gaza Strip--money that helped 
     prop up the Hamas government there. Prime Minister Benjamin 
     Netanyahu of Israel not only tolerated those payments, he had 
     encouraged them.
       During his meetings in September with the Qatari officials, 
     according to several people familiar with the secret 
     discussions, the Mossad chief, David Barnea, was asked a 
     question that had not been on the agenda: Did Israel want the 
     payments to continue?
       Mr. Netanyahu's government had recently decided to continue 
     the policy, so Mr. Barnea said yes. The Israeli government 
     still welcomed the money from Doha.
       Allowing the payments--billions of dollars over roughly a 
     decade--was a gamble by Mr. Netanyahu that a steady flow of 
     money would maintain peace in Gaza, the eventual launching 
     point of the Oct. 7 attacks, and keep Hamas focused on 
     governing, not fighting.
       The Qatari payments, while ostensibly a secret, have been 
     widely known and discussed in the Israeli news media for 
     years. Mr. Netanyahu's critics disparage them as part of a 
     strategy of ``buying quiet,'' and the policy is in the middle 
     of a ruthless reassessment following the attacks. Mr. 
     Netanyahu has lashed back at that criticism, calling the 
     suggestion that he tried to empower Hamas ``ridiculous.''
       In interviews with more than two dozen current and former 
     Israeli, American and Qatari officials, and officials from 
     other Middle Eastern governments, The New York Times 
     unearthed new details about the origins of the policy, the 
     controversies that erupted inside the Israeli government and 
     the lengths that Mr. Netanyahu went to in order to shield the 
     Qataris from criticism and keep the money flowing.
       The payments were part of a string of decisions by Israeli 
     political leaders, military officers and intelligence 
     officials--all based on the fundamentally flawed assessment 
     that

[[Page S2391]]

     Hamas was neither interested in nor capable of a large-scale 
     attack. The Times has previously reported on intelligence 
     failures and other faulty assumptions that preceded the 
     attacks.
       Even as the Israeli military obtained battle plans for a 
     Hamas invasion and analysts observed significant terrorism 
     exercises just over the border in Gaza, the payments 
     continued. For years, Israeli intelligence officers even 
     escorted a Qatari official into Gaza, where he doled out 
     money from suitcases filled with millions of dollars.
       The money from Qatar had humanitarian goals like paying 
     government salaries in Gaza and buying fuel to keep a power 
     plant running. But Israeli intelligence officials now believe 
     that the money had a role in the success of the Oct. 7 
     attacks, if only because the donations allowed Hamas to 
     divert some of its own budget toward military operations. 
     Separately, Israeli intelligence has long assessed that Qatar 
     uses other channels to secretly fund Hamas' military wing, an 
     accusation that Qatar's government has denied.
       ``Any attempt to cast a shadow of uncertainty about the 
     civilian and humanitarian nature of Qatar's contributions and 
     their positive impact is baseless,'' a Qatari official said 
     in a statement.
       Multiple Israeli governments enabled money to go to Gaza 
     for humanitarian reasons, not to strengthen Hamas, an 
     official in Mr. Netanyahu's office said in a statement. He 
     added: ``Prime Minister Netanyahu acted to weaken Hamas 
     significantly. He led three powerful military operations 
     against Hamas which killed thousands of terrorists and senior 
     Hamas commanders.''
       Hamas has always publicly stated its commitment to 
     eliminating the state of Israel. But each payout was a 
     testament to the Israeli government's view that Hamas was a 
     low-level nuisance, and even a political asset.
       As far back as December 2012, Mr. Netanyahu told the 
     prominent Israeli journalist Dan Margalit that it was 
     important to keep Hamas strong, as a counterweight to the 
     Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Mr. Margalit, in an 
     interview, said that Mr. Netanyahu told him that having two 
     strong rivals, including Hamas, would lessen pressure on him 
     to negotiate toward a Palestinian state.
       The official in the prime minister's office said Mr. 
     Netanyahu never made this statement. But the prime minister 
     would articulate this idea to others over the years.
       While Israeli military and intelligence leaders have 
     acknowledged failings leading up to the Hamas attack, Mr. 
     Netanyahu has refused to address such questions. And with a 
     war waging in Gaza, a political reckoning for the man who has 
     served as prime minister for 13 of the last 15 years, is, for 
     the moment, on hold.
       But Mr. Netanyahu's critics say that his approach to Hamas 
     had, at its core, a cynical political agenda: to keep Gaza 
     quiet as a means of staying in office without addressing the 
     threat of Hamas or simmering Palestinian discontent.
       ``The conception of Netanyahu over a decade and a half was 
     that if we buy quiet and pretend the problem isn't there, we 
     can wait it out and it will fade away,'' said Eyal Hulata, 
     Israel's national security adviser from July 2021 until the 
     beginning of this year.


                          Seeking Equilibrium

       Mr. Netanyahu and his security aides slowly began 
     reconsidering their strategy toward the Gaza Strip after 
     several bloody and inconclusive military conflicts there 
     against Hamas.
       ``Everyone was sick and tired of Gaza,'' said Zohar Palti, 
     a former director of intelligence for Mossad. ``We all said, 
     `Let's forget about Gaza,' because we knew it was a 
     deadlock.''
       After one of the conflicts, in 2014, Mr. Netanyahu charted 
     a new course--emphasizing a strategy of trying to ``contain'' 
     Hamas while Israel focused on Iran's nuclear program and its 
     proxy armies like Hezbollah.
       This strategy was buttressed by repeated intelligence 
     assessments that Hamas was neither interested in nor capable 
     of launching a significant attack inside Israel.
       Qatar, during this period, became a key financier for 
     reconstruction and government operations in Gaza. One of the 
     world's wealthiest nations, Qatar has long championed the 
     Palestinian cause and, of all its neighbors, has cultivated 
     the closest ties to Hamas. These relationships have proved 
     valuable in recent weeks as Qatari officials have helped 
     negotiate for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.
       Qatar's work in Gaza during this period was blessed by the 
     Israeli government. And Mr. Netanyahu even lobbied Washington 
     on Qatar's behalf. In 2017, as Republicans pushed to impose 
     financial sanctions on Qatar over its support for Hamas, he 
     dispatched senior defense officials to Washington. The 
     Israelis told American lawmakers that Qatar had played a 
     positive role in the Gaza Strip, according to three people 
     familiar with the trip.
       Yossi Kuperwasser, a former head of research for Israel's 
     military intelligence, said that some officials saw the 
     benefits of maintaining an ``equilibrium'' in the Gaza Strip. 
     ``The logic of Israel was that Hamas should be strong enough 
     to rule Gaza,'' he said, ``but weak enough to be deterred by 
     Israel.''
       The administrations of three American presidents--Barack 
     Obama, Donald J. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr.--broadly 
     supported having the Qataris playing a direct role in funding 
     Gaza operations.
       But not everyone was on board.
       Avigdor Lieberman, months after becoming defense minister 
     in 2016, wrote a secret memo to Mr. Netanyahu and the Israeli 
     military chief of staff. He said Hamas was slowly building 
     its military abilities to attack Israel, and he argued that 
     Israel should strike first.
       Israel's goal is ``to ensure that the next confrontation 
     between Israel and Hamas will be the final showdown,'' he 
     wrote in the memo, dated Dec. 21, 2016, a copy of which was 
     reviewed by The Times. A pre-emptive strike, he said, could 
     remove most of the ``leadership of the military wing of 
     Hamas.''
       Mr. Netanyahu rejected the plan, preferring containment to 
     confrontation.


                          Hamas as `an Asset'

       Among the team of Mossad agents that tracked terrorism 
     financing, some came to believe that--even beyond the money 
     from Qatar--Mr. Netanyahu was not very concerned about 
     stopping money going to Hamas.
       Uzi Shaya, for example, made several trips to China to try 
     to shut down what Israeli intelligence had assessed was a 
     money-laundering operation for Hamas run through the Bank of 
     China.
       After his retirement, he was called to testify against the 
     Bank of China in an American lawsuit brought by the family of 
     a victim of a Hamas terrorist attack.
       At first, the head of Mossad encouraged him to testify, 
     saying it could increase financial pressure on Hamas, Mr. 
     Shaya recalled in a recent interview.
       Then, the Chinese offered Mr. Netanyahu a state visit. 
     Suddenly, Mr. Shaya recalled, he got different orders from 
     his former bosses: He was not to testify.
       Mr. Netanyahu visited Beijing in May 2013, part of an 
     effort to strengthen economic and diplomatic ties between 
     Israel and China. Mr. Shaya said he would have liked to have 
     testified.
       ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``there were other 
     considerations.''
       While the reasons for the decision were never confirmed, 
     the change in tack left him suspicious. Especially because 
     politicians at times talked openly about the value of a 
     strong Hamas.
       Shlomo Brom, a retired general and former deputy to 
     Israel's national security adviser, said an empowered Hamas 
     helped Mr. Netanyahu avoid negotiating over a Palestinian 
     state.
       ``One effective way to prevent a two-state solution is to 
     divide between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank,'' he said in 
     an interview. The division gives Mr. Netanyahu an excuse to 
     disengage from peace talks, Mr. Brom said, adding that he can 
     say, ``I have no partner.''
       Mr. Netanyahu did not articulate this strategy publicly, 
     but some on the Israeli political right had no such 
     hesitation.
       Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right politician who is now Mr. 
     Netanyahu's finance minister, put it bluntly in 2015, the 
     year he was elected to Parliament.
       ``The Palestinian Authority is a burden,'' he said. ``Hamas 
     is an asset.''


                         Suitcases Full of Cash

       During a 2018 cabinet meeting, Mr. Netanyahu's aides 
     presented a new plan: Every month, the Qatari government 
     would make millions of dollars in cash payments directly to 
     people in Gaza as part of a cease-fire agreement with Hamas.
       Shin Bet, the country's domestic security service, would 
     monitor the list of recipients to try to ensure that members 
     of Hamas's military wing would not directly benefit.
       Despite those assurances, dissent boiled over. Mr. 
     Lieberman saw the plan as a capitulation and resigned in 
     November 2018. He publicly accused Mr. Netanyahu of ``buying 
     short-term peace at the price of serious damage to long-term 
     national security.'' In the years that followed, Mr. 
     Lieberman would become one of Mr. Netanyahu's fiercest 
     critics.
       During an interview last month in his office, Mr. Lieberman 
     said the decisions in 2018 directly led to the Oct. 7 
     attacks.

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. But Prime Minister Netanyahu's role in keeping Hamas 
in control in Gaza did not end there.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record 
a New York Times piece, again, from December of last year headlined: 
``Israel found the Hamas money machine years ago. Nobody turned it 
off.''
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

                [From the New York Times, Dec. 16, 2023]

  Israel Found the Hamas Money Machine Years Ago. Nobody Turned It Off

                    (By Jo Becker and Justin Scheck)

       Israeli security officials scored a major intelligence coup 
     in 2018: secret documents that laid out, in intricate detail, 
     what amounted to a private equity fund that Hamas used to 
     finance its operations.
       The ledgers, pilfered from the computer of a senior Hamas 
     official, listed assets worth hundreds of millions of 
     dollars. Hamas controlled mining, chicken farming and road 
     building companies in Sudan, twin skyscrapers in the United 
     Arab Emirates, a

[[Page S2392]]

     property developer in Algeria, and a real estate firm listed 
     on the Turkish stock exchange.
       The documents, which The New York Times reviewed, were a 
     potential road map for choking off Hamas's money and 
     thwarting its plans. The agents who obtained the records 
     shared them inside their own government and in Washington.
       Nothing happened.
       For years, none of the companies named in the ledgers faced 
     sanctions from the United States or Israel. Nobody publicly 
     called out the companies or pressured Turkey, the hub of the 
     financial network, to shut it down.
       A Times investigation found that both senior Israeli and 
     American officials failed to prioritize financial 
     intelligence--which they had in hand--showing that tens of 
     millions of dollars flowed from the companies to Hamas at the 
     exact moment that it was buying new weapons and preparing an 
     attack.
       That money, American and Israeli officials now say, helped 
     Hamas build up its military infrastructure and helped lay the 
     groundwork for the Oct. 7 attacks.
       ``Everyone is talking about failures of intelligence on 
     Oct. 7, but no one is talking about the failure to stop the 
     money,'' said Udi Levy, a former chief of Mossad's economic 
     warfare division. ``It's the money--the money--that allowed 
     this.''
       At its peak, Israeli and American officials now say, the 
     portfolio had a value of roughly half a billion dollars.
       Even after the Treasury Department finally levied sanctions 
     against the network in 2022, records show, Hamas-linked 
     figures were able to obtain millions of dollars by selling 
     shares in a blacklisted company. The Treasury Department now 
     fears that such money flows will allow Hamas to finance its 
     continuing war with Israel and to rebuild when it is over.
       ``It's something we are deeply worried about and expect to 
     see given the financial stress Hamas is under,'' said Brian 
     Nelson, the Treasury Department's under secretary for 
     terrorism and financial intelligence. ``What we are trying to 
     do is disrupt that.''
       That was what Israel's terrorism-finance investigators 
     hoped to do with their 2018 discovery. But at the top 
     echelons of the Israeli and American governments, officials 
     focused on putting together a series of financial sanctions 
     against Iran. Neither country prioritized Hamas.
       Israeli leaders believed that Hamas was more interested in 
     governing than fighting. By the time the agents discovered 
     the ledgers in 2018, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, 
     was encouraging the government of Qatar to deliver millions 
     of dollars to the Gaza Strip. He gambled that the money would 
     buy stability and peace.
       Mr. Levy recalled briefing Mr. Netanyahu personally in 2015 
     about the Hamas portfolio.
       ``I can tell you for sure that I talked to him about 
     this,'' Mr. Levy said. ``But he didn't care that much about 
     it.''
       Mr. Netanyahu's Mossad chief shut down Mr. Levy's team, 
     Task Force Harpoon, that focused on disrupting the money 
     flowing to groups including Hamas.

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I want to quote from Mr. Levy, who is quoted in that 
article. He was the Mossad chief in charge of economic policy. He says: 
``I can tell you for sure that I talked to him''--referring to Prime 
Minister Netanyahu--``about this. But he didn't care that much about 
it.''
  The article goes on to point out that Mr. Netanyahu's Mossad chief 
shut down Mr. Levy's team, the task force called Harpoon that focused 
on disrupting the money flowing to groups including Hamas.
  So let's go back to why Prime Minister Netanyahu and his extreme 
rightwing allies, like Smotrich and Ben Gvir, wanted to keep Hamas in 
place in Gaza. It is because, as they have said, their primary goal was 
to avoid the establishment of a Palestinian State. And so long as they 
could keep the Palestinians divided, they could avoid a united national 
movement for such a state. And so long as Hamas was in control of Gaza, 
it proved a useful foil against recognizing a Palestinian State that 
included the West Bank and Gaza, until the horror of October 7.
  The corollary of not threatening Hamas's control of Gaza has been to 
systematically weaken the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The 
terrible irony, of course, is that while helping perpetuate Hamas--
which was dedicated to the destruction of Israel and is dedicated to 
the destruction of Israel--Prime Minister Netanyahu and his allies have 
undermined the Palestinian Authority and the PLO, which, for over 30 
years, since the Oslo Accords, have recognized Israel's right to exist 
and have sought to coexist with Israel.
  Their strategy: Keep Hamas in place; undermine the Palestinian 
Authority.
  In fact, even today, during the war in Gaza, Finance Minister 
Smotrich is withholding an even greater share of the PA's own funds, 
and, since coming to power, the Netanyahu government has advanced even 
more settlements and allowed even more outposts deeper in the West 
Bank. And, of course, that further undermines the legitimacy of the PA 
in the eyes of the Palestinian people by exposing their total inability 
to stop those actions, even as they, the PA, help provide to Israel 
with security in certain areas of the West Bank.
  So Prime Minister Netanyahu has advanced the strategy of weakening 
the Palestinian Authority and facilitating Hamas in order to prevent 
Palestinians from being able to live in dignity in a state of their 
own. And the reason--the reason--that Prime Minister Netanyahu and the 
far-right extremists in his government, like Smotrich and Ben Gvir, 
don't want a Palestinian State in the West Bank is that they want it 
all for themselves in what they envision as a ``Greater Israel.''
  If you have Palestinians in the West Bank or who stay in the West 
Bank, you can't implement the vision of a ``Greater Israel''--their 
version of one state.
  So we come full circle. UNRWA was established to be a bridge to 
provide services, like education, to Palestinian refugees after they 
were displaced. I am sure its founders did not expect it to be around 
for so long, but that is because they likely never envisioned that, 74 
years later, the conflict that gave rise to UNRWA would remain 
unresolved.
  But it is unresolved, and now Prime Minister Netanyahu has openly 
opposed President Biden's call to resolve it, ultimately, by enacting a 
real two-state solution that would include normalization of relations 
between Israel and Saudi Arabia and the other Arab countries that have 
yet to recognize Israel--important security needed for the Jewish State 
of Israel.
  And at the same time that Prime Minister Netanyahu wants to torpedo a 
two-state solution to resolve the conflict, he also wants to pursue his 
long-term goal of ending the organization that was not born out of that 
conflict, UNRWA, and eliminating the services that it currently 
provides to Palestinian refugees.
  The United States should not be complicit in this scheme. We should 
not be a party to defunding UNRWA in Gaza, which is, right now, playing 
a critical role in the delivery of desperately needed food and 
humanitarian assistance to starving people. Nor should we be complicit 
in defunding the essential services UNRWA provides in places like the 
West Bank, Jordan, and other places.
  I support reforming UNRWA but not eliminating it. The question of 
defunding UNRWA is, at this very moment, the biggest unresolved issue 
in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. I call upon responsible 
Members of Congress in the Senate and the House to ensure that the 
United States does not defund UNRWA.
  Members of Congress who argue for the elimination of UNRWA have never 
bothered to drive a short distance from Jerusalem to visit an UNRWA 
school and hear young students talk about their dreams to be doctors, 
engineers, and educators, like some of us have done. There is hope in 
these schools, not hate, and, frankly, that is what we should be able 
to do here in the U.S. Senate.
  We should be on the side of hope. We should not be a party to more 
people starving in Gaza. We should not be a party to the closing of 
schools for Palestinian students in the West Bank, Jordan, and other 
countries. And the United States should not be a party to creating even 
more instability in the Middle East.
  Like many of my colleagues, and like President Biden, I believe the 
only way to create some light at the end of this dark tunnel is to find 
a path that ensures security for the Israeli people and dignity and 
self-determination for the Palestinian people.
  That is why I stand with our colleague Senator Schumer and his 
important and timely comments this morning that rejecting the idea of 
Palestinian statehood and sovereignty is a ``grave mistake'' for 
regional security and especially for the security of Israelis and 
Palestinians.
  Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that a two-state solution would be 
a big reward--reward, he says--for Hamas, but the opposite is true. 
Hamas has one plan: the destruction of the State of Israel and 
replacing the Jewish democratic state with one of their

[[Page S2393]]

own. They want one state. A two-state solution is contrary to 
everything Hamas stands for and all it seeks to achieve, so, far from 
being a reward, it would be a denial of their goal of one state under 
Hamas control.
  We all know that the road ahead will be long, and it will be hard. In 
the aftermath of the horrific Hamas attacks of October 7 and the 
current humanitarian disaster in Gaza, it is hard to imagine a time of 
peace and stability. That will only come when Palestinian leaders who 
fully embrace the right of Israel to exist in security and Israeli 
leaders who recognize that Palestinians must have a viable state of 
their own both make the necessary risks for peace.
  So let us push for an immediate cease-fire and a release of all the 
hostages, and then let us create a flicker of hope in this moment of 
darkness.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Booker). The Senator from South Carolina.
  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, at a later date, I will respond to my 
colleague from Maryland about UNRWA.
  But just to let people know who are following this today, I am the 
ranking Republican on the State, Foreign Ops Appropriations 
Subcommittee, and I work very well with Senator Coons. Senator Van 
Hollen is on the committee. There will not be one dime for UNRWA in any 
bill I support, period. And that is not just me; that is Senator 
Collins. She is the ranking member who worked very well with Senator 
Patty Murray to get the supplemental moving. Why is that? Because we 
believe UNRWA is compromised.
  I will come and show you the textbooks that UNRWA uses in the 
Palestinian community to teach the destruction of the Jewish people. I 
will show you texts from people in charge of UNRWA on the ground 
celebrating October 7.
  The case has been made over here that UNRWA is no longer a credible 
organization worth American taxpayer dollars to fund--not one penny for 
UNRWA.
  Helping the Palestinian people begins with changing the way they are 
taught in school. After we defeated the Germans and the Japanese, it 
took us a long time to deradicalize a population that was taught from 
birth to be radical. So what I hope will happen over the course of time 
is that new people in charge of the Palestinian community in the West 
Bank and Gaza will stop teaching the death of the Jews, trying to give 
the Palestinian children a more hopeful life. I hope that happens one 
day soon.
  The reason I came to the floor is I have been asked--probably like 
the Presiding Officer has--
  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Will the Senator from South Carolina yield for a 
question?
  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me finish. We will come and debate. I have a plane to 
catch.
  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. We really should debate because I don't know any 
evidence at all for your--
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has the floor.
  Mr. GRAHAM. We will come down, and we will have a discussion about 
everything I said. Let me finish my thought.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has the floor.
  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. We will have a very vigorous discussion about how 
wrong you are to empower this group that has been perpetrating all of 
the wrong things, not the right things.
  Now, having said all that--
  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Will the gentleman yield on that?
  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me finish my thought.
  Senator Schumer, whom I have worked with on immigration, on a bunch 
of things--I have tried to be bipartisan when it comes to foreign 
policy. My colleague, the President of the Senate, has been one of my 
best friends in trying to find a way forward to get Saudi and Israel to 
recognize each other. That would be a big blow to Iran.
  I have been asked, like everybody in the body: What do you think 
about Senator Schumer's speech?
  I am dumbfounded. I have always respected him. I disagree with him 
politically. What he said today was earth-shatteringly bad. The 
majority leader of the U.S. Senate is calling on the people of Israel 
to overthrow their government.
  Whether you like Bibi or not is not the question. The question is, Is 
it appropriate for anybody in this body telling another country to take 
their government down? We are going to have an election here. I hope we 
take the Biden government down through the election process, but that 
is for us to decide.
  This has been very hurtful. I have been on the phone almost all day 
trying to explain to people what happened, and I don't have a good 
explanation.
  We are trying to get Saudi Arabia to recognize the one and only 
Jewish State. That is no easy thing for the Crown Prince to do given 
this environment.
  We are trying to get Israel to take a leap of faith here that it 
doesn't have to be this way all the time, to do some things that would 
allow the Palestinian community to reorganize.
  Seventy-five percent of the Israeli people do not support a two-state 
solution now. They have been terribly wounded. There is no support by 
any politician in Israel--Gantz, Lapid, anybody--to unilaterally 
declare a Palestinian State.
  Five Presidents of the United States have said that if there is ever 
a Palestinian State, it will come through direct negotiations, without 
conditions, between the parties.
  In the Trump administration, Jared Kushner had a plan to establish a 
Palestinian State that Prime Minister Netanyahu actually agreed with.
  The point here is, what should America be doing now? America should 
be helping Israel without qualification. We should be trying to find a 
way to ease the suffering of the Palestinian people, and the best way 
to do that is to destroy Hamas. The reason so many Palestinians have 
been killed is because Hamas uses them as human shields.

  We live in a world that is literally upside down. We are having 
prominent Democratic Members--people I respect--calling on the Israeli 
people to take their government down. I can't believe it. I thought it 
was a joke. I thought somebody was pranking me this morning. This is a 
departure in a very serious way about how the United States interacts 
with its allies. I think it has done enormous damage to very delicate 
negotiations. I hope that Senator Schumer will revisit this.
  I don't know who he is trying to please by saying that, but they are 
not worth pleasing. I don't know who you are trying to please by saying 
that the Israeli Government needs to cease to exist as it is today and 
the Israeli people need to find somebody better, in the eyes of Senator 
Schumer.
  I am not asking the Israeli people to elect somebody I like; I am 
asking them: Whenever you have an election, elect somebody you like. I 
am not asking the people of Israel to bow to my view of how to settle 
this matter after the largest loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust. 
I want to give unconditional, unqualified support to the people of 
Israel to destroy Hamas.
  After World War II, if anybody had suggested to America that we need 
to take our foot off the gas when it came to destroying the Nazis and 
the Japanese, you would have been run out of town. What won the Oscar? 
A film called ``Oppenheimer'' talking about how the atomic bomb was 
created and used by our country to destroy two cities in Japan to end 
the war.
  You have to understand--and the Presiding Officer does; you have done 
your homework--you have to understand that October 7, to the Israeli 
people, is Pearl Harbor and 9/11 on steroids. It is not just a tit-for-
tat with Hamas; it was an attempt by Hamas to break the back of the 
Jewish people, to brutally rape and murder in a fashion they want the 
world to see.
  So the Israeli perspective on what to do is similar to what we 
thought we should do after World War II: total, complete victory; 
everybody mobilize and do what you have to do to end the war, to take 
the Nazis down; and the Imperial Japanese Army--destroy it 
unequivocally.
  Millions of people were killed in World War II. War is literally 
hell. But when you have been attacked the way we were on Pearl Harbor 
and 9/11, you have to respond forcefully. You have to make sure it 
never happens again. And the only way Israel can do this is to destroy 
the military capability of Hamas.

[[Page S2394]]

  So why did this happen? I believe that the great Satan, which is 
Iran, wanted this to happen to prevent a reconciliation between Saudi 
Arabia and the State of Israel, ending the Arab-Israeli conflict. A 
nightmare for the Ayatollah is that the Arabs and the Jews make peace 
and economically integrate, leaving them behind.
  Israel has signed agreements with six of their Arab neighbors under 
Bibi's leadership.
  When I go, I meet with Lapid, I meet with Gantz, and I meet with 
Bibi. I meet with everybody because it is not about Bibi; it is not 
about Gantz; it is about our relationship. If it is Gantz or Lapid next 
time, I will meet with them. I know them all. Mr. Lapid and I are very 
good friends. I have known Bibi for 25 years. It is about, what should 
we do to help our friends in Israel?
  Nothing would please me more than to find a way to end this war 
sooner rather than later and get back on track for their normalization 
process, but we cannot expect Israel to stop now. It is like putting 80 
percent of a fire out--the 20 percent is going to start it all over 
again.
  We are down to six brigades, organized military units that Hamas has 
to wreak havoc on the Palestinian people and the State of Israel. It is 
nonnegotiable: Hamas will be destroyed militarily.
  I am hoping, in the middle of all this chaos, we can still find a way 
for Saudi Arabia and Israel to normalize. That would be the ultimate 
death blow, I think, to the Iranian ambitions in the region. Part of 
that deal, as the Presiding Officer knows, would be the Palestinians 
would have a better life eventually; that Saudi Arabia and UAE would 
invest heavily into Gaza and the West Bank; new, younger, less corrupt 
people running the place, trying to find a pathway forward where the 
Palestinians and Israel can coexist in a way that is beneficial for 
all.
  That can never happen until Hamas is destroyed. If Hamas is still in 
place, they will kill everybody who wants to make peace with Israel. 
They did it before. They have no desire, as Senator Van Hollen said, of 
recognizing the Jewish State.
  But I will close where I began. What Senator Schumer said on the 
floor of the Senate is taking the country and the Senate down the wrong 
road. This is not something any of us should be saying--calling on a 
government to be toppled, basically, by its own people.
  At the end of the day, Bibi is not the problem. The problem is 
radical Islam wanting to kill every Jew they can find. The problem is 
Iran, which has its mission to destroy the Jewish State and to purify 
Islam.
  I could spend hours talking about the Biden-Obama policy of 
empowering the Ayatollah, but that is not for today.
  So what I would say to what Senator Schumer said today--my response 
to Senator Schumer: I am disappointed. You have done a lot of damage, 
my friend, and you need to fix this.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate.

Mr. President, I have spoken repeatedly about the 
nomination of Adeel Mangi to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Notwithstanding his anti-Semitic affiliations, it seems every week a 
new law enforcement organization announces its opposition to this 
nominee for his record of associating with the most radical type of 
anti-police activists--those who support cop killers.
  Apparently, some Democrats are finally listening to law enforcement 
and the Jewish groups sounding the alarm.
  Last week, a number of Democratic Senators reportedly told the White 
House that they didn't think Mr. Mangi has the votes. This, of course, 
produced a panic on the left. This week, a New York Times columnist 
accused Republicans of Islamophobia for criticizing Mangi and his 
dalliance with anti-Semitic activists. Democrats, on the other hand, 
were urged to get in line and vote for him.
  Who is giving this advice?
  Well, the author of the piece herself had previously speculated that 
Israel may be engaged in genocide in Gaza. She called the Israeli war 
of self-defense a ``charnel house of horrors.'' She defended the anti-
Semitic Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, and she even got 
mealymouthed about the October 7 attacks, saying:

       [T]wo can play the game of who started it and who is to 
     blame, rolling back the clock to biblical times to try to fix 
     ultimate responsibility for the catastrophe of Israel and 
     Palestine.

  So, again, what has Mr. Mangi done to deserve friends like these or, 
indeed, to merit such a vehement, blinkered defense from the Biden 
administration?
  Just yesterday, the White House called opposition to Mr. Mangi's 
nomination a ""smear campaign solely because he would make history as 
the first Muslim to serve as a federal appellate judge.''

  How insulting. What self-respecting attorney wants to hear that a 
President cares more about the demographic tick boxes than their life's 
work?
  Besides, in the case of Mr. Mangi, Senate Republicans' opposition has 
absolutely nothing to do with his Muslim faith. Rather, it has 
everything to do with his longstanding sympathy for and association 
with some of the most radical elements in society.
  I happily voted for the first Muslim article III judge at the outset 
of the Biden administration, also of New Jersey--so did 31 of my 
Republican colleagues--in one of the largest bipartisan votes for a 
judge in the Biden Presidency. But we didn't support this nominee 
because he was Muslim; it was because he had an extraordinary personal 
and professional background.
  Mr. Mangi's associated center at Rutgers asks convicted terrorists if 
we overly ``exceptionalize'' 9/11. Judge Quraishi, on the other hand, 
thought
9/11 was exceptional and joined the Army soon after, rendering 
honorable service in Iraq.
  Mr. Mangi spent his career making millions in defending corporate 
clients like foreign energy companies, massive drugmakers, and even 
chocolate monopolies, all while volunteering his time to support anti-
police activists. Judge Quraishi, on the other hand, supported law 
enforcement professionally, first at Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement and then as an assistant U.S. attorney.
  We are told that any questioning of Mr. Mangi's record is 
Islamophobia. On the other hand, the terrorist-adjacent Council on 
American-Islamic Relations demanded that Senators probe Judge 
Quraishi's experience in the Army and in law enforcement, saying their 
concerns ``must be addressed.''
  According to Democrats' rhetoric, shouldn't this organization also be 
condemned for Islamophobia?
  Two Muslim Biden nominees with records as different as night and 
day--Republicans happily supported the nominee who served his country 
and backed the blue. We have and we will continue to oppose the nominee 
who has repeatedly chosen, instead, to mingle with supporters of 
terrorists and cop killers.
  I hope more Democrats will join us in opposing Mr. Mangi, and should 
they fall victim to spurious associations of bias, perhaps they should 
remind the White House of an alternative candidate, rested and ready, 
in the Federal courthouse in Trenton, NJ.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Adeel Mangi has been nominated by 
President Biden to serve on the Third Circuit. We have had a hearing 
before the Judiciary Committee, a vote in the committee, and his name 
is on the calendar.
  In recent weeks, we have heard an amazing number of attacks against 
this individual. It is hard to imagine some of the things that are 
being said about him. They bear no resemblance to the truth.
  What was said this morning on the floor of the U.S. Senate is 
painful. To accuse a nominee of being anti-Semitic is heartbreaking 
when it is not true. In this case, it clearly is not true.
  After the initial hearing on Mr. Mangi, who would be the first Muslim 
to serve on the Federal circuit bench, we received communications from 
several groups in defense of his nomination and critical of the 
questioning that took place in the Senate Judiciary Committee. One of 
the most noteworthy came from the Anti-Defamation League.
  The ADL issued a statement in response to what they called ``the 
inappropriate and prejudicial treatment of

[[Page S2484]]

Adeel Abdullah Mangi, a nominee for the U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals.'' I am going to read this in its entirety because it clearly 
rebuts the charge that was made on the Senate floor today that this 
nominee is anti-Semitic:

       As the leading anti-hate organization in the world, whose 
     mission is ``to stop the defamation of the Jewish people and 
     to secure justice and fair treatment to all,'' ADL is 
     compelled to speak out about the inappropriate and 
     prejudicial treatment of Adeel Abdullah Mangi, a nominee for 
     the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, during the Judiciary 
     Committee Hearing on December 13, 2023.

  The ADL statement goes on to say:

       During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Mangi was subjected to 
     aggressive questioning unrelated to . . . professional 
     expertise or qualifications. Rather, he was forced to provide 
     responses to a wide range of inquiries regarding his views on 
     global strategic considerations in a manner that 
     inappropriately politicized these issues and raised serious 
     questions regarding pretext and bias.

  The ADL statement goes on to say:

       Just as associating Jewish Americans with certain views or 
     beliefs regarding Israeli government actions would be deemed 
     antisemitic, berating the first American Muslim federal 
     appellate judicial nominee with endless questions that appear 
     to have been motivated by bias towards his religion is 
     profoundly wrong.

  The ADL goes on to say:

       Hate, bias, and bigotry have no place in government, 
     especially in the hallowed halls of Congress. When nominees 
     approach a congressional hearing, their religion, heritage, 
     race, gender, or any other protected identity characteristic 
     should not be a subject for political fodder.
       This was an attempt to create controversy where one did not 
     exist.
       ADL urges leaders to refrain from fueling discrimination 
     and hate--and urges the Senate to offer Mr. Mangi a fair 
     vote, based on his qualifications and fitness for the job.

  That statement from the ADL--as they describe themselves, the 
``leading anti-hate organization in the world'' when it comes to the 
Jewish people--is specific and directed toward those who are really 
making criticisms of Mr. Mangi which are not warranted in any aspect of 
fact.
  To have a man characterized as anti-Semitic on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate is a gross miscarriage of justice in this case. This gentleman 
could not have been more explicit in his statements against terrorism, 
against what happened in Israel on October 7, and the fact that he is 
coming before this body with no prejudice whatsoever toward the Jewish 
people.
  The questions that were asked of him, a Muslim nominee, are 
heartbreaking. At one point, one of the Republican Senators asked if he 
celebrated 9/11 in his family household. He said: Of course not. He was 
sickened by what happened on that day and had friends who were 
associated with the losses.
  This kind of treatment of any nominee is unacceptable in America. To 
charge someone as anti-Semitic on the floor of the U.S. Senate is truly 
unfortunate, if not scandalous in itself. We should be fair to every 
nominee, whether proposed by a Democratic or Republican President, and 
we should not have any prejudice or bigotry when it comes to a person 
because of their religious beliefs.
  I am sorry that this was said on the floor of the Senate this 
morning. I hope that the person who did it will have second thoughts 
about whether or not that was appropriate."

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I have been attending town halls and meetings 
across my district for the last 2 weeks in smaller communities in 
Wisconsin like Edgerton, Sauk City, Monroe, Mazomanie, and Darlington. 
These are communities with hardworking people that have a strong work 
ethic and upper Midwestern values like fairness and compassion.
  At those meetings, Mr. Speaker, I have heard a common thread: They 
don't like what they are seeing in Gaza and Israel. The vast majority 
recognize that the attack on October 7 was horrific and Israel had a 
right to respond, but they didn't have a right to collectively punish 
2.3 million people stuck in Gaza.
  They know that 1,200 people are dead in Israel from the attack and 
over 130 people are still being held by Hamas. However, they also know 
that nearly 34,000 people are dead in Gaza, 70 percent of which are 
women and children, clearly not members of Hamas.
  They know that 2 million people have been displaced in Gaza and the 
majority of the buildings and infrastructure have been demolished or 
damaged by Israeli bombs. They know that the people are dying of 
starvation because almost every entry point to Gaza is through Israel 
and not enough supplies and aid are getting through.
  They understand that the United States is trying to help with aid, 
but we have to drop it from the air or bring it in by sea because our 
friend Israel won't allow us to bring it in through easier, safer ways 
like by truck and transport.
  They know that aid workers are being killed, 200 plus to date, 
including some from Chef Jose Andres' World Central Kitchen. The 
limited food, water, and supplies that are being let in have to be 
distributed, but aid workers are too often killed in the process of 
delivering humanitarian aid, making alleviating suffering even more 
difficult.
  They don't understand how we can provide both armaments and aid to 
the same area, as that doesn't make sense to people with Midwestern 
sensibilities.
  They tell me it looks like punishment for being Palestinian. They 
tell me it appears Benjamin Netanyahu wants people to leave Gaza for 
good. They tell me it looks too much like what genocide would look 
like, and that concerns them greatly.
  The bombings of the World Central Kitchen workers, the seemingly 
targeted and repeated bombings, despite the Israeli military knowing 
their location and purpose, has been one more step too far by the 
Netanyahu government's handling of this war.
  Enough is enough.
  The indiscriminate killing must stop. The aid must flow. The hostages 
must be released and a cease-fire must hold to protect every child in 
Gaza and Israel.
  The devastation has been severe, far more severe than it ever needed 
to be. The world would have understood a response going after Hamas 
killers, but the Netanyahu government has gone too far, way too far in 
its response.
  That is why I helped lead a letter signed by 56 Members of Congress 
to the President to stop any additional offensive arms transfers to 
Israel without a thorough investigation of the World Central Kitchen 
killings and a plan for aid and assistance to get to starving 
Palestinians.
  The United States has long supported two nations existing side by 
side in peace, a two-state solution, but Benjamin Netanyahu doesn't 
support that reasoned path to peace. And that, along with his punishing 
innocent Palestinians while allegedly going after Hamas, has made it 
time to get a divorce from Benjamin Netanyahu.

  I support the overwhelming majority of Israelis who want peace. They 
want to live safely without bombs raining on them from extremists in 
Gaza. They too don't like the direction and mistakes of the Netanyahu 
administration, and they want the hostages returned immediately.

[[Page H2149]]

  The overwhelming majority of Palestinians want peace, as well. They 
just want to live their lives with dignity and independence as they 
should, but they need to be treated as equals with human rights, which 
too often they are not.
  I urge our government to do more to help distribute aid, utilizing 
great groups like the World Central Kitchen, UNWRA, and so many others 
that are doing this work. Our government must stop supplying any 
offensive weapons or equipment that damages Gaza further, especially in 
regard to any invasion of Rafah.
  Let's take this awful, current situation and make some good out of 
it. We need to double down on a two-state solution that recognizes the 
many, many good people of Israel and Palestine that want to live in 
peace. It is achievable, and the United States is crucial to that 
peace. That is what I am hearing in my district."

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Schneider) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I am proud that the United States was the

[[Page H2259]]

first country to recognize the newly declared State of Israel nearly 76 
years ago, merely 11 minutes after its creation.
  I am also proud that, within 11 days of Hamas' barbaric attack on 
Israel that started this current war, President Joe Biden landed in Tel 
Aviv, sending two carrier strike groups and becoming the first U.S. 
President to ever visit Israel during a time of war.
  On October 7, at approximately 6:30 a.m., Hamas launched thousands of 
rockets at cities across Israel, sending millions of Israelis into bomb 
shelters and safe rooms while providing cover for a swarming army of 
Hamas terrorists who invaded the country and launched a genocidal 
attack, brutally murdering more than 1,200 people, wounding more than 
3,000 others, and taking more than 250 hostages back into Gaza.
  In the 6 months since Hamas started this war, Israel has been 
fighting for its existence on many fronts, facing attacks and threats 
from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Iran.
  It is more than just the mortars, rockets, missiles, and drones 
threatening Israel. Israel's enemies have two key strategies in their 
campaign to destroy and delegitimize the Jewish state: One, distort the 
truth with canards and libelous accusations against Israel and the 
Jewish people; and two, isolate Israel in global forums and in the 
world of public opinion.

                              {time}  1030

  South Africa is perversely accusing Israel of genocide in the 
International Criminal Court of Justice. Of course, when you lift the 
veil of this grotesque distortion of the truth, you see that Iran is 
also behind South Africa's actions, just like Iran finances and fuels 
Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.
  Meanwhile, in cities around the world as well as here in the United 
States, anti-Israel protests are replete with calls for the elimination 
of the Jewish state, most clearly manifest in the chant ``from the 
river to the sea, Palestine will be free.''
  And look no further than the rally just last Friday in Dearborn, 
Michigan, where the crowd chanted not only ``death to Israel,'' but 
``death to America.''
  I am grateful for the leadership and moral clarity of the Biden 
administration as well as the mayor of Dearborn when they roundly 
condemned this hateful rhetoric.
  Israel's enemies, from Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, to groups here in 
the United States like SJP, AMP, and JVP are doing everything they can 
to demonize, delegitimize, and ultimately destroy the only Jewish state 
on Earth.
  But let's be clear: The war Hamas started on October 7 is not just a 
war against Israel. Iran's vision is not just the destruction of 
Israel, but the conquest of the entire Muslim world and the defeat of 
the West. The Houthis are not launching rockets at just Israeli ships 
in the Red Sea. They are targeting global commerce in general. In this 
war, Israel's allies must do everything we can to fight the lies and 
ensure Israel and the Israeli people know that they are not alone.
  This is why I traveled to Israel with Jewish lay leaders from Chicago 
in February and last month traveled with several of my colleagues from 
here in Congress.
  This is why I oppose the Republican resolution we are considering 
this week. The text of this resolution plays loose with the truth, and 
the intent is not to help Israel, but to win political points and 
further weaken the bipartisan support Israel has long enjoyed in this 
body.
  Don't take my word for it. This is how Axios described the 
resolution: ``It is the latest in a series of Israel-related wedge 
votes House Republicans have held since Hamas' October 7 attack.''
  If my Republican colleagues want to help our ally and protect our 
national security, we shouldn't be debating this partisan resolution. 
Instead, we should be voting on the essential funding bill to help 
Israel fight its war against our common enemies, as well as ensuring 
Ukraine defeats Russia, and Taiwan remains secure.
  The Senate passed this bill 2 months ago. The House should have 
passed it in February as well. It is as shameful as it is dangerous 
that we still have not voted on this desperately needed assistance yet 
today.
  Mr. Speaker, Iran understands that diminishing the bipartisan support 
for Israel in Congress only hurts our ally and advances our enemies' 
agenda.
  Why are Republicans so willing to play into the hands of Iran and 
Israel's other enemies? The U.S.-Israel relationship is being tested. 
Congress is being tested. It is up to us here today to pass this test.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution and instead vote for 
the essential funding bill coming over from the Senate."

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:
  God of mercy and compassion, of grace and reconciliation, only You 
can speak into the crisis that has descended upon the Middle East. Only 
Your peace can cure the warring madness that has erupted in this land 
so many call holy.
  Let the hatred that has severed the region, intensifying the profound 
animosity between Israel and Palestine, and in turn swallowing up the 
cities of Gaza, Tel Aviv, Ramallah, and Ashkelon to name but a few, be 
supplanted by acts of mercy and overcome by deeds of justice.

[[Page H2263]]

  Touch the hearts of each offender, that all would be purified of 
their thirst for vengeance. Speak into the souls of all aggressors, 
that they would renounce their prejudice.
  Abide with the countless victims of violent attacks, with the 
innocents held hostage in the crossfire of escalating hostilities. 
Grant comfort and sanctuary to those who have fled their homes in fear. 
Receive the refugees into the safety of Your welcoming embrace. Make 
way in the desert that the hungry would receive food.
  Let all Christians, Muslims, and Jews put away anger, wrath, malice, 
and slander. May each find a renewed spirit of forgiveness and 
understanding in the knowledge that all bear the image of You, our 
Creator.
  For the sake of Your kingdom, may each of us, politician and patriot, 
voter or victim, be agents of Your purpose, that Your peace and justice 
would, once again, rule this land.
  In the redemption of Your name, we pray.
  Amen."

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Moran) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) each will 
control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Gallagher, for introducing 
this important bipartisan legislation to address ongoing atrocities 
committed by Hamas and other Iran-backed terrorist organizations.
  For years, it has been well documented how terrorist organizations 
like Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad use civilians as 
human shields in conflict.
  Hezbollah terrorists are systematically embedded in civilian areas 
and population centers throughout Lebanon. Hezbollah has embedded 
hundreds of arms depots, thousands of terrorists, and tens of thousands 
of rockets throughout densely populated southern Lebanon, and Hamas' 
utter disregard for human life has been made plain for all to see since 
October 7.
  After murdering 1,200 people on October 7, 2023, and taking 240 
hostages, they have prevented innocent Palestinians from fleeing 
conflict zones and repeatedly rejected proposals that would bring a 
pause to the fighting in Gaza.
  These terrorists do not care about innocent civilian lives. They know 
exactly what they are doing when they use a hospital as military 
headquarters and stockpile weapons in schools. Terrorist groups like 
Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have no regard for the 
lives of the innocent women and children they place in harm's way by 
co-locating civilian and military targets.
  Every civilian that is harmed in this war is harmed as a result of 
Hamas' actions. As Israel defends itself against the threat of Hamas 
and other Iran-backed terrorist groups, we must address the urgent 
issue of terrorist organizations using civilian shields immediately.
  Congress must stand against these brutal practices and strengthen 
their ability to hold these terrorists accountable for their crimes.
  The 2018 Sanctioning the Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act 
established a strong framework for holding Hamas and other terrorist 
organizations accountable. This legislation today would reauthorize the 
2018 law through the year 2030 and add Palestinian Islamic Jihad as a 
covered entity. It also establishes new tools to ensure that those who 
use human shields are held accountable.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this 
measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.
                                         House of Representatives,


                                   Committee on the Judiciary,

                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2024.
     Hon. Michael McCaul,
     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman McCaul: I write regarding H.R. 5917, the 
     Strengthening Tools to Counter the Use of Human Shields Act. 
     Provisions of this bill fall within the Judiciary Committee's 
     Rule X jurisdiction, and I appreciate that you consulted with 
     us on those provisions. The Judiciary Committee agrees that 
     it shall be discharged from further consideration of the bill 
     so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.
       The Committee takes this action with the understanding that 
     forgoing further consideration of this measure does not in 
     any way alter the Committee's jurisdiction or waive any 
     future jurisdictional claim over these provisions or their 
     subject matter. We also reserve the right to seek appointment 
     of an appropriate number of conferees in the event of a 
     conference with the Senate involving this measure or similar 
     legislation.
       I ask that you please include this letter in your 
     committee's report to accompany this legislation or insert 
     this letter in the Congressional Record during consideration 
     of H.R. 5917 on the House floor. I appreciate the cooperative 
     manner in which our committees have worked on this matter, 
     and I look forward to working collaboratively in the future 
     on matters of shared jurisdiction. Thank you for your 
     attention to this matter.
           Sincerely,
                                                       Jim Jordan,
     Chairman.

                                         House of Representatives,


                                 Committee on Foreign Affairs,

                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2024.
     Hon. Jim Jordan,
     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Jordan: Thank you for consulting with the 
     Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from 
     further consideration of H.R. 5917, the Strengthening Tools 
     to Counter the Use of Human Shields Act, so that the measure 
     may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.

[[Page H2418]]

       I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure 
     does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of 
     your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives

                                         House of Representatives,


                                  Committee on Armed Services,

                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 2024.
     Hon. Michael T. McCaul,
     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 5917, the 
     Strengthening Tools to Counter the Use of Human Shields Act. 
     As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions 
     within H.R. 5917 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of 
     the Committee on Armed Services, I forego any further 
     consideration of this bill so that it may proceed 
     expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.
       The Committee on Armed Services takes this action with our 
     mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 
     5917 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over 
     subject matter contained in this or similar legislation and 
     that our committee will be appropriately consulted and 
     involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so 
     that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction.
       Finally, I ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on 
     this matter be included by the Foreign Affairs Committee in 
     the Congressional Record during floor consideration, to 
     memorialize our understanding. Thank you for the cooperative 
     spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and 
     others between our respective committees.
           Sincerely,

                                            Michael D. Rogers,

                                         Chairman, House Committee
     on Armed Services.

                                 Committee on Foreign Affairs,

                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 2024.
     Hon. Mike Rogers,
     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Rogers: Thank you for consulting with the 
     Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from 
     further consideration of H.R. 5917, the Strengthening Tools 
     to Counter the Use of Human Shields Act, so that the measure 
     may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.
       I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure 
     does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of 
     your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives 
     on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would 
     support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate 
     number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate 
     conference on this legislation.
       I will seek to place our letters on this bill into the 
     Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate 
     your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward 
     to continuing to work together as this measure moves through 
     the legislative process.
           Sincerely,
                                                Michael T. McCaul,
                                                         Chairman.

  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5917, the Strengthening 
Tools to Counter the Use of Human Shields Act, and I thank my 
colleagues, Representative Gallagher and Representative Sherman, for 
introducing this legislation.
  As we all know, Hamas regularly uses people as human shields, hiding 
behind them and thereby endangering innocent Palestinian civilians. We 
have seen this clearly in the months since October 7, but this behavior 
is not new. It is and has been the de facto policy of Hamas for many 
years.
  Hamas has operated from under, inside, and adjacent to hospitals, 
schools, and other civilian structures. Within civilian buildings, they 
have stored weapons caches and ammunition, built miles of tunnels 
underground, and launched attacks from behind women and children.
  When Israel instructed families in Gaza to flee to the south for 
safety, Hamas demanded people stay in Gaza City, to remain in place, 
saying that it was beneficial to their strategy.
  Hamas does not care for the Palestinian people. They never have. They 
never will. Hamas only means to exploit them as human shields.
  This behavior of hiding behind noncombatants is a clear violation of 
international law and has been an unconscionable contributor to the 
deaths of too many innocent Palestinian people.
  This measure, H.R. 5917, amends the Sanctioning the Use of Civilians 
as Defenseless Shields Act, adding additional terrorist entities, 
bolstering congressional oversight and reporting requirements, and 
extending its sunset provision.
  This legislation will renew and strengthen existing law, and I 
encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), the author of this bill.
  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  It is fitting, at least for me, that we are debating this today 
because one of the very first bills I got passed as a freshman Member 
of Congress working across the aisle with my fellow classmate, 
Representative Suozzi, was the Sanctioning the Use of Civilians As 
Defenseless Shields Act, which first created the authority for the 
President to sanction Hamas and Hezbollah for their use of human 
shields.
  I remember at the time talking about this barbaric practice. I was 
met with shock and surprise.
  Unfortunately, in the wake of October 7, the entire world has seen 
the lengths that these terrorist groups will go to in order to advance 
their genocidal cause, using innocent women and children as human 
shields. The fact that this may be one of the last bills I get passed 
in Congress is fitting.
  As I alluded to, there is nothing new about this despicable practice, 
which Hamas has perfected, of using civilians and hostages as human 
shields. They have been doing it for decades, placing innocents in 
harm's way. They have been unmasked in recent months for the world to 
see.
  Rocket launchers, weapons caches, and terrorist fighters are found in 
or near civilian population centers, including sites like schools and 
mosques, to deliberately limit the Israeli military from striking Hamas 
targets or, if they do, to incur the condemnation of the world against 
them in order to limit their effectiveness going forward.
  Our condemnation of this heinous war crime is not enough. We must use 
the full weight of American sanctions to curtail this practice and 
encourage like-minded countries to combat it, as well.
  This bipartisan bill does just that. As the ranking member of the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs talked about so eloquently, we extend the 
sunset of that authority, which dates back to 2018, from 2023 to 2030. 
It includes updates to ensure this is used to punish terrorists. 
Importantly, it gives the chairmen and ranking members of several 
congressional committees the power to require a written response from 
the President with a determination of whether a foreign person meets 
the criteria for sanctions and the President's justification for 
imposing or not imposing sanctions.
  Additionally, it requires mandatory sanctions on Palestinian Islamic 
Jihad members who use human shields and supports constructive efforts 
to combat human shields by requiring the Department of Defense to 
submit a report to Congress on efforts to equip our allies to counter 
the use of human shields across the globe.
  Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking 
Member Meeks for their leadership of the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and for their support of this bill during the markup.
  I am also grateful for Congressman Sherman's partnership in this 
effort to renew and update these important sanctions.
  Again, I think back to where I was 8 years ago as a freshman Member 
talking about what was then a very niche and poorly understood issue. 
Unfortunately, because of the barbarism on display, because of Hamas' 
actions in attacking and killing innocent Israelis, now the entire 
world has seen this barbaric practice up close. It is time for us to 
act.
  I draw great optimism from the fact that even in this, with 
everything we have going on in Congress, Republicans and Democrats can 
come together on something this common sense to stand with our allies 
and stand firmly against our enemies.

  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Speaker, Hamas has not only shown complete disregard for the 
Palestinian people. It has also used them as human shields as an 
intentional war tactic. It is unconscionable and in clear violation of 
international law, contributing to the deaths of 
innocent noncombatants.

  This measure updates and extends the Sanctioning the Use of Civilians 
as Defenseless Shields Act by adding additional terrorist entities, 
bolstering congressional oversight and reporting requirements, and 
extending its sunset provisions.
  The strengthening of this existing statute is timely, important, and 
necessary, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5917.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his support. This is a 
really important bipartisan piece of legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, we must continue to do all that we can to address the 
crimes committed by Hamas and other Iran-backed terrorist groups. The 
use of civilians as human shields in conflict is abhorrent and immoral.
  Congress must do everything in its power to hold Hamas and other 
terrorist groups accountable for these crimes. We have a responsibility 
to protect innocent civilians around the world who are used as human 
shields.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Moran) that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 5917.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this motion will be postponed."

Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 883) expressing the sense of 
the House of Representatives that the slogan, ``from the river to the 
sea, Palestine will be free'' is antisemitic and its use must be 
condemned.
  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.
  The text of the resolution is as follows:

                              H. Res. 883

       Whereas the slogan ``from the river to the sea, Palestine 
     will be free'' is an antisemitic call to arms with the goal 
     of the eradication of the State of Israel, which is located 
     between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea;
       Whereas the slogan seeks to deny Jewish people the right to 
     self-determination and calls for the removal of the Jewish 
     people from their ancestral homeland;
       Whereas Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, 
     and other terrorist organizations and their sympathizers have 
     used and continue to use this slogan as a rallying cry for 
     action to destroy Israel and exterminate the Jewish people;
       Whereas this rallying cry can promote violence against the 
     State of Israel and the Jewish community globally;
       Whereas, on October 7, 2023, Hamas committed a barbaric and 
     uncivilized slaughter against the Jewish people, killing 
     1,200 people;
       Whereas victims of this massacre included children, the 
     elderly, Holocaust survivors, and women, who were murdered 
     indiscriminately in their homes, communities, public spaces, 
     and at a music festival;
       Whereas, on October 7, 2023, Hamas reportedly beheaded 
     dozens of babies, committed countless atrocities, and 
     violently raped women;
       Whereas, on October 7, 2023, Hamas recorded and broadcasted 
     to the world mutilation, desecration, and public parading of 
     bodies;
       Whereas, on October 7, 2023, Hamas took over 240 hostages, 
     including children, women, elderly Israelis, Americans, and 
     other foreign nationals;
       Whereas, on October 7, 2023, Hamas murdered the highest 
     number of Jewish people since the Holocaust;
       Whereas Hamas' 2017 Charter states, ``Hamas rejects any 
     alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, 
     from the river to the sea.'';
       Whereas Hamas' 2017 Charter states, ``There shall be no 
     recognition of the legitimacy of the Zionist entity.'';
       Whereas Hamas' 2017 Charter states, ``Resistance and jihad 
     for the liberation of Palestine will remain a legitimate 
     right.'';
       Whereas this slogan is used by the same people who utter 
     ``death to America'' and ``death to Israel'';
       Whereas former Hamas Chief Khaled Meshaal called for the 
     ``day of rage'', a global mobilization against the State of 
     Israel, which had profound consequences for Jewish 
     communities around the world;
       Whereas a member of the Hamas political bureau, Ghazi 
     Hamad, in an interview about the October 7 massacres, vowed, 
     ``We must teach Israel a lesson, and we will do it twice and 
     three times. The Al-Aqsa Deluge is just the first time, and 
     there will be a second, a third, a fourth.'';
       Whereas Ghazi Hamad, in the same interview, responded, 
     ``Yes, of course'', when asked if he believed in the 
     annihilation of Israel;
       Whereas the Secretary General of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah 
     stated, ``Palestine, from the sea to the river is the 
     property of Arabs and Palestinians and no one has the right 
     to give up even a single grain of earth or one stone.'';
       Whereas Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, on November 11, 
     2023, stated that the only solution to this war is ``The 
     establishment of the Palestinian State from the river to the 
     sea.'';
       Whereas the founder of al-Qaeda and the perpetrator of the 
     9/11 terrorist attacks, Osama bin Laden, stated, ``Borders 
     must be opened by force so as to obtain all the necessary 
     requirements to liberate the entire Palestine from the river 
     to the sea, God willing.'';
       Whereas the former Dictator of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, 
     stated, ``Glorious and sublime are our martyrs in Palestine, 
     Iraq, and the nation as a whole. Long live Palestine, free 
     and Arab, from the sea to the river'', and ``Palestine is 
     Arab and must be liberated from the river to the sea'';
       Whereas this slogan neglects the fact that innocent 
     civilians are used as human shields by Hamas;
       Whereas Hamas intentionally locates its military weapons 
     supply depots and intelligence outposts directly under and 
     within civilian populated sites such as schools, mosques, 
     residential buildings, and hospitals such as the Al Shifa 
     Hospital, the largest hospital in Gaza;
       Whereas using civilians as human shields for protecting 
     weapons and fighters from a lawful attack is considered a war 
     crime;
       Whereas hateful rhetoric obstructs peace efforts;
       Whereas the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish 
     Committee deem this slogan antisemitic;
       Whereas this slogan incites fear within the Jewish 
     community in the United States and around the world;
       Whereas students attending institutions of higher education 
     have chanted and continue to chant this slogan since the 
     barbarous October 7 massacres, yet all the while, their 
     fellow Jewish students are being harassed and intimidated; 
     and
       Whereas this slogan has been used recently by violent 
     protestors throughout the United States and the world: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of 
     Representatives that--
       (1) the slogan, ``from the river to the sea, Palestine will 
     be free'', is outrightly antisemitic and must be strongly 
     condemned;
       (2) this slogan is divisive and does a disservice to 
     Israelis, Palestinians, and all those in the region who seek 
     peace;
       (3) this slogan rejects calls for peace, stability, and 
     safety in the region;
       (4) this slogan perpetuates hatred against the State of 
     Israel and the Jewish people; and
       (5) anyone who calls for the eradication of Israel and the 
     Jewish people are antisemitic and must always be condemned.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) 
each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.


                             General Leave

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this 
measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from South Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I thank our colleague from New York (Mr. D'Esposito) 
for introducing this important bipartisan resolution to condemn anti-
Semitic speech.
  Hamas' horrific and murderous attack on Israel on October 7 massacred 
over 1,200 innocent people. Hamas terrorists committed brutal sexual 
assaults. They took over 250 people hostage and held them in wretched 
conditions.

[[Page H2431]]

  October 7 was the deadliest day for people of Jewish faith since the 
Holocaust.
  Since that awful day 6 months ago, we have seen a shocking rise in 
anti-Semitic attacks, symbolism, and speech, including a resurgence of 
the slogan ``from the river to the sea.''
  This phrase, ``from the river to the sea,'' comes directly from the 
terrorist organization's covenant. Hamas is clear about their ultimate 
goal: the destruction of the State of Israel and the death of Jews 
around the world.
  Article 7 of the August 18, 1988, Hamas Covenant calls for chasing 
every Jew behind trees and rocks until the last Jew is found behind a 
rock and is killed.
  We must be clear. This rallying cry, and others like it, have no 
place in a peaceful and tolerant society. ``From the river to the sea'' 
refers to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. 
This language calls for entirely destroying the State of Israel and 
replacing it with the Palestinian state.
  Slogans like this are clearly anti-Semitic and hateful. They 
inherently support the destruction of Israel and denying Jews their 
right of self-determination of any kind.
  Promoting violence against Israel and Jews is anti-Semitism, and we 
have the responsibility in Congress to condemn such language.
  With this resolution, we are condemning this hate speech and standing 
with our valued ally, Israel. We understand the chant of Tehran 
gruesomely in English, ``Death to Israel, death to America.''
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1545

  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, the 10-word slogan ``from the river to the 
sea, Palestine will be free'' means different things to different 
people. For many well-meaning supporters of the Palestinian cause, it 
is a slogan calling for future Palestinian statehood and Palestinian 
dignity. I agree with those goals, and that is why I support a two-
state solution.
  To others, particularly to Israelis and Jews in the diaspora, the 
phrase is a threat, symbolizing the destruction of the Jewish people 
and the Jewish State of Israel, and I acutely understand that concern 
as well.
  However, a basic truth is evident. If you consider the geographic 
area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea to be 
exclusively Palestine, you are taking the Jewish State of Israel off 
the map.
  As clearly demonstrated by pro-Palestinian protesters following the 
horrific events of October 7, far too many people who boldly chant this 
phrase do not want Israel to exist. I know this because when asked, 
that is how they answer.
  As someone steeped in America's civil rights movement, I clearly 
understand the First Amendment and the right of free speech. I support 
peaceful protest. I support what my dear friend and former colleague 
John Lewis taught us about good trouble. It is okay for supporters of 
the Palestinian cause or the Israeli cause to cause some good trouble.
  When good trouble turns into calls for violence or, in this case, 
wiping the State of Israel off the map, the rhetoric has gone too far. 
It becomes dangerous, and it can cause people harm. That is why I 
support this nonbinding resolution critical of that phrase.
  Let me be clear: There is absolutely nothing anti-Semitic about 
advocating for an independent Palestinian state. However, calling for 
the elimination of the Jewish state, praising Hamas who strives for 
Israel's destruction, or suggesting that the Jews alone do not have the 
right to self-determination is anti-Semitic.
  I am a strong supporter of a two-state solution, which will result in 
the area between the river and the sea being the home to a Jewish State 
of Israel and an independent and prosperous Palestine. That is what we 
should be chanting for and what I will never give up hope for, a 
peaceful Middle East, two states side by side.
  When I talked to some citizens of Israel right after intifada, all 
they said is they wanted to live in peace with their neighbors.
  When I talked to some young Palestinians in the West Bank, all they 
said they wanted was to live in peace with their Israeli neighbors.
  That is what we should be striving for.
  While I am not really happy that we have to consider this resolution 
that I do believe, unfortunately, was brought here by my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle in an attempt to divide this House, I also 
know the danger of the phrase in question. That is why the resolution 
actually has my begrudging support.
  In this institution, at times you have got to do what you think is 
the best thing to do, the right thing to do, and that is why I support 
this resolution, and I encourage my colleagues to join in doing the 
same.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. D'Esposito), chairman 
of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Management and 
Technology and the author of this resolution.
  Mr. D'ESPOSITO. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 
883. I rise today, as well, to thank House Republican leadership for 
bringing my resolution to a vote as part of their swift and necessary 
response to Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel. My resolution 
condemns the slogan ``from the river to the sea, Palestine will be 
free'' because it is blatantly anti-Semitic.
  Madam Speaker, it is no coincidence that this slogan has been 
embraced by not only the violent, barbaric leaders of Hamas, but also 
countless other terrorist organizations and adversarial nations like 
Iran. I remind my colleagues that this slogan was used by Iranian 
leaders responsible for the recent attacks on Israel. It is also no 
coincidence that this phrase has roots in Hamas' charter, a document 
which explicitly calls for the destruction of the State of Israel, the 
ancestral homeland of the Jewish people.
  When anti-Semitic activists, masquerading as merely pro-Palestinian, 
spray-painted this slogan on the site of the 1972 Munich massacre of 
Israeli Olympians, we know and they know exactly what they are 
communicating. This slogan communicates one thing and one thing only. 
It is not human rights. It is certainly not peace. It is the violent 
destruction of the State of Israel and the Jewish people that live 
within it.
  Madam Speaker, at a time in history when anti-Semitic attacks have 
surged nearly 400 percent following Hamas' brutal, unprovoked October 7 
attack on Israel, we need this resolution now more than ever. When 
Jewish students throughout this Nation and in my home State of New York 
at universities like Columbia and Cooper Union speak up about the anti-
Semitism they are facing, they cite phrases and slogans just like 
these. Too often, events that may have started as peaceful protests 
quickly cross the line and turn into anti-Semitic, anti-Jew rallies. 
Perhaps the most common denominator in these instances is the presence 
of this slogan. It is not simply a slogan; it is a threat. It is a 
threat to Israel. It is a threat to the Jewish people. It does not get 
us any closer to peace. It gets us further from it. To employ this 
slogan is to perpetuate the cause of hate and regional instability.
  I remind my colleagues that the Anti-Defamation League regards the 
slogan as anti-Semitic and a cry for Israel to not exist. The ADL 
informs us that to use this slogan is to call for ``effectively erasing 
and destroying the entire Jewish state.'' I remind my colleagues that 
between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea sits America's 
strongest ally, the Middle East's only democracy, and the ancestral 
homeland of the Jewish people.
  As the Representative of the most Jewish communities in this country, 
it is very clear that we need to act. Between the Jordan River and the 
Mediterranean Sea sits Israel, a free, diverse nation, a safe haven for 
Jewish people formed in the wake of the mass murder of European Jews.
  When the world witnessed the tragedies of the Holocaust, we said: 
``Never again.'' Now is our chance to mean it and to reject anti-
Semitic hate in all of its forms whenever and wherever it rears its 
ugly head.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time for the purpose of closing.

[[Page H2432]]

  

  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Speaker, as I stated during this debate, I am a strong supporter 
of a two-state solution, which will result in the area between the 
river and the sea being the home to a Jewish State of Israel and an 
independent and prosperous Palestine.
  This is what we should all be chanting for. This is what we should 
all be hoping for. This should be what we all are working for. It is in 
the best interests of the Palestinian people, the Jewish State of 
Israel, and the United States of America. Let's end hate. Let's end 
anti-Semitism. Let's bring people together. That should be what we are 
all looking for. Let's not put forth things that hurt and divide.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 
883, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance 
of my time to close.
  Mr. Speaker, we must do everything in our power to condemn anti-
Semitic speech and actions at home and around the world.
  It is so sad that since October 7 instead of rallying around our 
Jewish friends, we have seen a disgusting rise in anti-Semitic attacks. 
We cannot allow hate speech to be normalized as so well and eloquently 
stated by Ranking Member  Greg Meeks.
  This resolution, so thoughtfully and capably introduced by 
Congressman Anthony D'Esposito, makes clear that this language is not 
normal. Calling for the destruction of the people of Israel is not 
normal. It is not acceptable, and today this House will reject this 
language.
  I am grateful for the leadership that we see today of Foreign Affairs 
Chairman   Michael McCaul and Ranking Member  Greg Meeks. We have clear 
bipartisanship, working together for the safety of American families.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Murphy). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) that the 
House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 883.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.

Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 
1149, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 1143) condemning Iran's 
unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel, and ask for its 
immediate consideration in the House.
  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1149, the 
resolution is considered read.
  The text of the resolution is as follows:

                              H. Res. 1143

       Whereas, beginning on April 13, 2024, Iran for the first 
     time ever launched a direct attack on Israel that included 
     over 350 missiles and drones launched directly from Iran and 
     its proxies toward Israel;
       Whereas this direct attack on Israel followed: Iran-backed 
     Hamas' massive, unprovoked attack on Israel on October 7 that 
     killed over 1,200 people; months of cross-border attacks from 
     Iran-backed Hezbollah into Israel from Lebanon; over 170 
     attacks on United States troops in the Middle East by Iran-
     backed militias since October; and months of Iran-backed 
     Houthi missile and drone attacks on global shipping;
       Whereas 99 percent of the projectiles fired at Israel were 
     intercepted by Israel, the United States, the United Kingdom, 
     France, and Jordan, minimizing casualties and other damage 
     from this unprecedented, brazen attack by Iran;
       Whereas Israel intercepted these missiles and drones using 
     a variety of air defense systems and other defense articles, 
     including many procured from or co-produced with the United 
     States, demonstrating the vital importance of the United 
     States and Israel's security partnership; and
       Whereas Israel is a major non-NATO ally and Major Strategic 
     Partner of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
       (1) condemns Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack 
     on Israel;
       (2) reaffirms and supports Israel's right to self-defense;
       (3) stands with Israel as it defends itself against Iran's 
     attack and seeks to re-establish deterrence against Iran and 
     its proxies;
       (4) fully supports Israel's right to respond to this 
     aggression through military, diplomatic, economic, and other 
     necessary means;
       (5) calls on all countries to unequivocally condemn Iran's 
     attack on Israel;
       (6) commends the United States military, the United 
     Kingdom, France, and Jordan for intercepting Iranian missiles 
     and drones and thereby limiting the damage from this 
     unprecedented attack on Israel;
       (7) reaffirms the United States commitment to Israel's 
     security, including through security assistance and defense 
     sales;
       (8) urges full enforcement of United States sanctions and 
     export controls against Iran to impede Iran's nuclear 
     program, missile and drone development, and funding of 
     terrorist groups and proxies, including Hezbollah, Hamas and 
     Palestine Islamic Jihad, the Houthis, and militias in Iraq 
     and Syria; and
       (9) stands ready to assist Israel with emergency resupply 
     and other security, diplomatic, and intelligence support.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The resolution shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or their respective designees.
  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kean) and the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Meeks) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kean).


                             General Leave

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New Jersey?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.
  Madam Speaker, over the weekend, the world watched in horror as Iran 
launched over 350 drones and missiles at our ally and friend, Israel.
  This attack confirmed our worst fears. The likely attack was openly 
discussed in the media for days before it occurred. For years, Iran had 
been threatening Israel and amassing a terrifying arsenal of missiles 
and drones. No one should have had any doubt that one day Iran would 
fulfill its longstanding threat of ``death to Israel.''
  However, the fact that this unprecedented, escalatory attack was long 
expected does not make it any less terrifying. Were it not for close 
coordination between Israel, the United States, and other partners to 
successfully intercept these weapons, Israel and other countries in the 
region could have faced significant casualties and major damage.
  Over the last 7 months, we have seen Iran's poisonous influence rip 
apart the Middle East. Iran-backed Hamas launched the massive, 
unprovoked October 7 attack on Israel that killed over 1,200 people. 
Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets, mortars, and missiles into 
Israel. Iran-backed militias have launched over 170 attacks on American 
troops in the Middle East, and the Iran-backed Houthis have launched 
over 100 missiles and drone attacks on global shipping.
  This is not just a threat to Israel. This is a threat to the United 
States and to all of our partners in the Middle East.
  That is why this moment is of such tremendous strategic importance. 
Iran's proxies are testing the resolve of Israel, the United States, 
and the international community. We absolutely must restore deterrence 
against Iran to protect our vital national security interests in the 
Middle East. That means standing shoulder to shoulder with our friend 
and ally, Israel.
  We are stronger together. Together, this coalition literally shot 
missiles and drones out of the sky, protecting cities and citizens 
alike.
  Like some of my colleagues over the Easter recess, my wife, Rhonda, 
and I traveled to Israel and were able to see firsthand the impacts of 
the conflict on the people there. The resolve of the Israeli people is 
stronger than ever.
  H. Res. 1143 makes a simple, clear statement that we stand with 
Israel and support Israel's right to defend itself and to restore 
deterrence, including by responding to this attack as appropriate. It 
also makes clear that our longstanding commitment to Israel's

[[Page H2508]]

security, including through arms sales and security assistance, is 
ironclad. Finally, it urges full enforcement of all of our sanctions 
against Iran and its proxies.
  Madam Speaker, we must not forget that what Israel experienced over 
the weekend is, unfortunately, a reality of everyday life in Ukraine. 
Our adversaries are working closer together than ever before to 
undermine the American-led international order that has kept peace in 
the world since the Second World War.
  Before the United States ultimately joined the war, Winston Churchill 
showed the world the fortitude to look into the face of 
authoritarianism. He declared that democracies of the world stand up 
for their beliefs, and they would endure.
  We must project that same message today and in the future. Our allies 
and our partners are watching what actions this body takes. We must 
project that Churchillian confidence.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the gentleman from New Jersey's 
resolution, H. Res. 1143, condemning Iran's unprecedented drone and 
missile attack on Israel.
  Like every Member of this body, I am horrified by Iran's direct 
attack on Israel.
  In retaliation for Israel's targeted strike against two Iranian 
military generals in Damascus on April 1, Iran launched more than 300 
drones and powerful missiles at Israel's population--Jews, Muslims, and 
Christians alike.
  The great success of Israel's missile shield, codeveloped by the 
United States of America, and the combined forces of the U.S. military, 
France, the U.K., and Jordan, prevented significant death and 
destruction.
  Our thoughts and hearts are with the young Israeli Bedouin girl, who 
is recovering today from injuries she suffered due to an Iranian 
projectile.
  I stand strongly with the people of Israel and their defense against 
both direct and proxy Iranian attacks, and I support this resolution 
being offered by Representative Kean.
  Israel, of course, has the right to defend itself like any other 
country, but as a true friend of Israel, I encourage the Israeli 
Government to be smart and strategic as it considers its response, and 
I urge this body not to beat the drums of war.
  As Secretary Blinken recently said, an escalation of the conflict is 
not in the United States' or Israel's interests.
  Believe me, I really understand the rage felt by Israel toward the 
Government of Iran, a government hell-bent on wiping Israel off the 
map. The two generals whom Israel eliminated worked day and night to 
provide Iranian proxies the lethal materiel and strategy necessary to 
significantly harm the State of Israel.

  I also understand the need for Israel to maintain strategic 
deterrence. Iran needs to know there will be serious consequences if it 
attempts to harm Israel. Deterrence serves to prevent an expansion of 
conflict.
  I also understand the massive consequences of Israel and Iran 
descending into a broader war and what that would mean for the United 
States and the rest of the entire world. An expanded Israel-Iran war 
would distract from the ongoing conflict in Gaza, a conflict that must 
end, while ensuring the elimination of Hamas' military capabilities.
  We still have challenges. We must free the hostages remaining in Gaza 
and achieve a humanitarian cease-fire. Famine and the current 
humanitarian catastrophe must be reversed at all costs. There must be a 
realistic plan for the future governance and reconstruction of Gaza, 
one that results in Palestinian control of the strip.
  An expanded Israel-Iran war could also serve to drag the United 
States of America deeper into the conflict. As the ongoing debate on 
the supplemental should make clear, the United States already has a lot 
on its plate.
  Madam Speaker, please remember that Russia's war of aggression in 
Ukraine remains unfinished business and that Ukraine is losing ground 
to Russian forces due to Donald Trump's interference in our emergency 
supplemental process.
  The future of Europe is urgently--urgently--at stake. Already, there 
are dangerous conflicts simmering throughout the Middle East region, 
including continued attacks by the Houthis in Yemen against 
international shipping and U.S. military forces. China still has its 
sights set on Taiwan as China strengthens its relationship with both 
Iran and Russia.
  An expanded war in the Middle East would put American soldiers 
deployed in the region in greater danger. It would harm the American 
middle class and global economies still clawing back pandemic-spurred 
inflation, just as our economy is beginning to rebound.
  Are there those amongst us who think it is wise to open a broader war 
in the Middle East this week? Do we want to further encourage Iran to 
rush to build and test a nuclear weapon? Do we want to give Vladimir 
Putin and Xi Jinping the satisfaction of the United States being bogged 
down in war?
  China and Russia would love to see the United States embroiled and 
distracted in the Middle East as they continue their nefarious 
destabilizing objectives in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. We should not 
let that happen.
  Madam Speaker, I conclude my remarks where I started. We stand 
strongly with the State of Israel and its right to defend its people. 
Israel, without question, has the right to defend itself, and I hope 
that strategy and thoughtfulness rule the day, not rage and revenge. 
There is too much at stake.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  0930

  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Kiley).
  Mr. KILEY. Madam Speaker, I stand in strong support of this 
resolution condemning Iran's unprecedented missile and drone attack on 
Israel.
  However, it is important to note that for the people of Israel, 
attacks and threats from Iran are far from unprecedented. Every single 
day, the people of Israel face attacks from Iran's terrorist proxies 
that literally surround the State of Israel: Hezbollah, the Houthis, 
and, of course, Hamas.
  We saw the consequences of Iran's massive support for these terrorist 
proxies play out in horrifying fashion on October 7. Now, with this 
latest unprecedented attack directly from Iran, we saw almost all of 
the missiles and drones intercepted. This is a testament to the 
strength and the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship, both in 
terms of the partnership that has allowed Israel to develop such an 
impressive capacity to defend itself and in terms of the collaboration 
that was on display.
  I am glad that we will soon have an opportunity to provide long 
overdue support for Israel in this time of such great importance for 
the region.
  Something else, though, is equally important to note about what 
happened last weekend, and that is that you had regional allies, other 
countries in the region, also rally to Israel's defense. This is 
something the likes of which we have not seen before, and it speaks to 
the extraordinary success of the Abraham Accords to usher in a new era 
of peace in the region. This, of course, is exactly what Iran does not 
want. This is the reason for their desperation. They understand what is 
unfolding if they do not respond, if they do not somehow stand in the 
way of it.
  This is a time not only for the United States to stand with our ally, 
Israel, but for every nation around the world that values peace, 
freedom, and democracy to do so as well.
  I strongly support this resolution. I would hope it passes this House 
with strong, unanimous, bipartisan support.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, as people are here witnessing 
us speaking about how the attacks are all interconnected, Iran, Russia, 
and China all are seeking to do harm to our Nation and to the Western 
rules-based order.
  It is extraordinarily important in these times that we show strength 
and unity of purpose. I am thankful that the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. Meeks), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
supported this measure both in the Rules Committee as well as on the 
floor here

[[Page H2509]]

today. It shows the very strong importance of this resolution and our 
unparalleled support for the State of Israel and its right to defend 
itself.
  We, as the House of Representatives, have the responsibility to 
pass--and I expect later this week we will--a strong foreign aid 
package that will support our opposition to Iran, Russia, and China, 
and make sure that we support the people who are fighting for their 
freedom in Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan to make sure that we have strong 
support of the American people. That is why it is important on a 
bipartisan basis that we work together to support this measure.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in sending a strong bipartisan and overwhelming show of support for 
the State of Israel by agreeing to this resolution.
  Our allies and partners are closely watching this body's actions. We 
must send a clear message that we stand by our allies and our partners 
and are resolved against the adversaries and those who wish us all 
harm.
  Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of this resolution, and I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean) and ask that she may control 
that time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Pennsylvania will 
control the time.
  Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to 
join me in sending a strong, bipartisan message, an overwhelming 
support for the State of Israel by agreeing to this resolution. Our 
allies and our partners are closely watching this body's actions, and 
we must send a clear message that we stand by our allies and our 
partners and are resolved against our adversaries and those who wish to 
do all of us harm. I urge the adoption of this resolution.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
Scalise), the majority leader. He is a strong supporter of the State of 
Israel. Time and again, he has led this floor in the support of one of 
our strongest allies in the world.
  Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for 
leading this effort and for making sure all of our colleagues have the 
opportunity to stand with our friend, Israel, while they are at war.
  We all know, starting October 7, Israel was attacked barbarically by 
one of Iran's proxies, Hamas, a terrorist organization. They went into 
Israel, barbarically murdered Israelis and took hostages. Still to this 
day they have about 130 hostages, including some American citizens.
  While this war to eviscerate the terrorist organization known as 
Hamas is going on, Israel then over the weekend faced an unprecedented 
attack directly from Iran. No longer is it only the proxies--whether it 
is Hamas, Hezbollah, or the Houthis, all who are supported by Iran--now 
Iran directly attacked with 300-plus drones and missiles to try to kill 
more Israelis.

  Fortunately, of course, Israel and a coalition of the United States 
and other allies joined together to shoot down those missiles and 
drones. At the same time, Iran made it clear they wanted to attack 
Israel directly, which means Israel now is looking at how they properly 
respond.
  During this time, again, a war that started--this idea of a cease-
fire, the cease-fire ended when Hamas decided that they were going to 
go murder Israelis. Israel has a right to self-defense. This Congress 
has always stood by our friend, Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle 
East, a democracy.
  They are always under attack. They have been under attack since their 
existence. They know how to defend themselves. When they respond--
whatever choice the people of Israel make through their elected 
leaders--we need to express our support for that defense. That is 
Israel's right.
  We saw September 11, but there have been other attacks on our 
homeland; of course, Pearl Harbor. When America is attacked, America 
responds. We don't have our allies calling us, saying: Don't respond. 
This is a time when the allies of Israel, including the United States, 
need to support Israel in their right to respond. Call out Iran, as 
this resolution does. Mr. Kean has been very good about laying out the 
case for why we need to condemn Iran and their actions, but we also 
need to support Israel as they consider their options in how to 
properly respond to deter this from happening again.
  It was unwarranted. It shouldn't have happened. We shouldn't just 
look and say: Well, all the missiles and drones were shot down, so 
everybody should just look the other way. They will keep trying until 
they kill innocent civilians.
  Iran has always sponsored terrorism, and they have gotten away with 
it. We need to put sanctions back on Iran. They shouldn't be able to 
sell their oil on world markets, for example. Iran has made about $60 
billion in the last 3 years selling their oil on world markets. They 
shouldn't have that access. They use that money to sponsor terrorism, 
and now they are using that money directly to attack our friend and our 
ally, Israel.
  While Israel is under attack, now more than ever we need to be 
unequivocal in our support for our friend, Israel, in their right to 
self-defense. God bless the people of Israel. We stand with them. This 
resolution makes it very clear.
  I thank, again, my friend from New Jersey for bringing this important 
piece of legislation. I urge its adoption, Madam Speaker.
  Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance 
of my time to close.
  I stand by Israel and its right to defend itself and condemn in the 
strongest of terms Iran's direct attack on our ally. It is my hope that 
Israel listens to what many of its allies are saying and not take steps 
that lead us into a greater regional war.
  As President Biden has said, our defense against Iranian threats to 
Israel is ironclad. We have Israel's back, and we will not yield to 
Iranian threats.
  Madam Speaker, I support this resolution, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close. I urge the adoption of this resolution, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 1149, the previous question is ordered 
on the resolution and the preamble.
  The question is on adoption of the resolution.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and 
nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.

announced policy of January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Green) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority 
leader.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, Mr. Speaker, and 
still I rise. Today, I would like to do something just a bit different. 
I have stood here on many occasions and said that I love my country, 
that I salute the flag. I still love my country and salute the flag, 
and today what I would like to do is actually salute the flag. I just 
believe that any time is a good time, especially when you are in this 
facility, to salute the flag.
  If you would indulge me, Mr. Speaker, I would like to move to another 
podium.
  And still I rise, Mr. Speaker, proud to stand here in the well of the 
House of Representatives. One can but only imagine the great speeches, 
the oratory that is imitated from this area. However, today, I want to 
do something different. I just want to say the Pledge of Allegiance 
from this very almost sacred place.
  Those who would like to join me, you but only have to stand and as 
you would normally salute the flag, you may do so. If you choose not 
to, you don't have to. The greatness of America will not be measured by 
whether the Al Greens of the world salute the flag. The greatness of 
America will be measured by whether the Al Greens of the world would 
defend those who choose not to salute the flag, who choose not to say 
the Pledge of Allegiance, who choose not to sing the national anthem, 
who choose not to stand for the anthem.
  I, today, will do what I will do, and that is salute the flag. To all 
of my friends who are here, we are about to say the Pledge of 
Allegiance, and for those who choose not to, you don't have to, but 
those who do, would you join me by standing. I place my hand over my 
heart when I say the Pledge of Allegiance. I shall lead in the Pledge 
of Allegiance.

       I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of 
     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation 
     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate everyone joining me in this Pledge of 
Allegiance.
  I wanted to do this because I believe the values that we have in this 
country we can export to the rest of the world.

[[Page H2514]]

I believe that the words in the Declaration of Independence, a founding 
document, these are words that we can export to the rest of the world: 
All persons created equal, endowed by their creator with certain 
unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. These are powerful words. These words are words that we are 
in this country still trying to make real. It is a great and noble 
ideal, but we still have not gotten there yet. We are forming still our 
more perfect Union.
  I think that as we do it here, I believe that these things can be 
exported to the rest of the country--the rest of the world, if you 
will--the notion that all persons are created equal, endowed by their 
creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness.
  I want to focus for just a moment on life, this aspect of the 
Declaration of Independence. I want to focus on lives not just in this 
country because we do this quite often, so I have said a lot about the 
deaths that are taking place here, the mass shootings that are taking 
place here, yes, but I want to export this idea to another place.
  I want to talk about this noble concept as it relates to Gaza and 
what is happening to the lives in Gaza. I want to do this because for 
too long the thousands that have lost their lives have been 
statisticized. The statisticization of their lives is a disservice to 
humanity. These innocent people, innocent men, women, and especially 
children, their lives should not be just simply statisticized. Their 
lives ought to be humanized.

  Today, I would like to humanize the lives, and I also have a 
resolution commemorating innocent civilian lives lost in Gaza, 
especially children.
  Let's export the great and noble American ideal in our Declaration of 
Independence, let's apply it to people on a global basis.
  Now I shall move back to the podium where I ordinarily make my 
comments because I have some paraphernalia there that I will be 
introducing. Mr. Speaker, I move to the next podium.
  This is a resolution that I am previewing. There may be some 
tweaking, but I am previewing it, and it will be filed either today or 
tomorrow. This resolution commemorates innocent civilian lives lost in 
Gaza, especially children.
  Whereas, this resolution may be cited as the original resolution 
commemorating innocent civilian lives lost in Gaza, especially 
children.
  Whereas, on October 7, 2023, Hamas conducted a heinous attack on 
Israel leading to Israel declaring war on Hamas--not Palestine, not 
Palestinians, but declaring war on Hamas. And I say this because, 
unfortunately, a good many people--too many, if you will--have 
concluded that the war is against Palestinians, against Palestine. The 
war was declared against Hamas, and the Prime Minister of Israel 
himself has indicated that the war is against Hamas. He has also 
indicated that the Palestinians are victims, the Palestinians are 
victims. I concur. The innocent Palestinian men, women, and especially 
children are victims of this war. They are victims to the extent that 
they not only suffer from being in a war zone, but they also suffer by 
being harmed in various and sundry ways--and I will say more about this 
later--and they are losing their lives.
  Continuing:
  Whereas, both Palestinians and Israelis are in mourning. The country 
of Israel is still in mourning from the October 7 horrendous attack. 
Gazans, Palestinians, innocent men, women, and children are in mourning 
because of the thousands, the tens of thousands, who have lost their 
lives in this war.
  Whereas, in 2020 the population of Gaza was over 2 million with 
approximately half being children under the age of 18.
  Whereas, the pain, suffering, and deaths of innocent Palestinian men, 
women, and especially children, are too often reduced to 
statisticization.
  Whereas, people of good will must do more than statisticize the pain, 
suffering, and killing of innocent civilian Palestinians.
  Whereas, people of good will must do more to humanize the pain and 
suffering of Palestinians in Gaza with explanations of how they lost 
their arms, legs, eyes, ears, and lives.
  Let me repeat this because this statisticization is something that is 
difficult to say but also something that we ought not attribute to 
persons who have lost their arms, legs, eyes, and hearing, as well as 
their lives. This is a very sad, sad circumstance to have to negotiate 
and deal with.
  Whereas, because of the war, homes, schools, businesses, hospitals 
and, more importantly, their lives in Gaza have been destroyed.
  Whereas, because of the war many businesses have been decimated.
  Whereas, hundreds of thousands of innocent civilian men, women, and 
especially children, in Gaza have suffered through the loss of mothers, 
fathers, brothers, and sisters while starving and suffering the mental 
anguish associated with war.
  Whereas, civilians in Gaza live in constant fear of sudden loss of 
arms, legs, and life; and
  Whereas, tens of thousands of innocent civilians, including thousands 
of children, have been brutally killed in a war beyond their control.
  Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of Representatives 
commemorates the tens of thousands of innocent civilian lives lost in 
Gaza, especially those of children. The lives lost should be viewed as 
more than mere statistics, the humanity, the pain, suffering, and 
deaths of the tens of thousands of men, women, and especially children, 
must be commemorated and memorialized.
  The killing of innocent men, women, and especially children, in 
Palestine must cease immediately with all possible haste.
  All hostages must be returned immediately--and we are talking about 
hostages that are Israeli, as well as any that may be Palestinian, but 
we know that Israeli hostages were taken.
  And finally, because the United States' largess has contributed to 
the purchase of munitions used by the Netanyahu administration, the 
United States must do everything it can to address the humanitarian 
catastrophe in Gaza perpetrated by the destruction of homes, 
infrastructure, schools, hospitals, and, also, I would add, the loss of 
human life.
  Now, I would like to give you some graphic indications of what this 
is all about. There is an article from The New Yorker that I would like 
to read, dated March 21, 2020. I will go through it, and then I will 
show you some pictures of what has happened. But first, let's start 
with this representation.

                              {time}  1145

  This is a representation of persons who are in mourning, and they are 
doing what people do when they are suffering. You can see persons who 
are screaming and crying out.
  The language reads: ``Of the thousands of Palestinians killed in 
Gaza, about 70 percent have been women and children.''
  That is quite a large number. About 70 percent have been women and 
children.
  This representation is of persons who are making an appeal for food. 
You can see in their eyes a sadness. You can see, with their hands 
extended, a plea for food.
  The language reads: ``The catastrophic levels of hunger and 
starvation in Gaza are the highest ever recorded on the IPC scale, both 
in terms of number of people and percentage of the population,'' the 
highest ever recorded of hunger in Gaza.
  Now, this picture is a representation that tears at your heart as 
well but perhaps even in a more profound way because this young lady 
that you see, this baby, she is without her left leg. She is on a 
playground, so one would conclude that she is not in Gaza. You would be 
correct. You would be incorrect if you assume that this injury occurred 
in some place other than Gaza because that is where it occurred. As I 
read this article from The New Yorker, which I alluded to earlier, you 
will get a better comprehension of where she is and what happened to 
her.
  Mr. Speaker, it is a very sad story, but we have to humanize these 
thousands of people. We can't just allow them to just become numbers. 
If they are just numbers, it is easy to dismiss them as just casualties 
of war.
  They are more than numbers. These are human beings who have suffered. 
These are human beings who have relatives that are suffering. These are

[[Page H2515]]

human beings whose lives are never going to be the same. There is a 
good likelihood that they won't have what we have in this country, and 
that is the medical assistance to help them recover, those who survive, 
as well as the medical attention for mental illness that they may 
suffer.
  Mr. Speaker, these are human beings. Some mother cried because of 
what happened to this child. Some father is crying because of what has 
happened to his child in Gaza. We cannot allow them to be dehumanized 
and reduced to statistics. We have to humanize these persons.
  Mr. Speaker, I have chosen this baby as the example for us to give 
some thought to.
  This article in The New Yorker is styled ``The Children Who Lost 
Limbs in Gaza.'' The subtitle reads: ``More than a thousand children 
who were injured in the war are now amputees.''
  Mr. Speaker, some things bear repeating; I say this quite regularly. 
It reads: ``More than a thousand children who were injured in the war 
are now amputees.''
  This baby is more than one in a thousand.
  What do their futures hold?
  This article was published on March 21, 2024. It continues. This is 
the photograph that accompanied this article. The excerpts read: 
``Gazal was wounded on November 10, when, as her family fled Gaza 
City's Al-Shifa hospital, shrapnel pierced her left calf.''
  That would be the leg that she lost, and this is what will break your 
heart: ``To stop the bleeding, a doctor, who had no access to 
antiseptic or anesthesia, heated the blade of a kitchen knife''--no 
antiseptic, no anesthesia, heated the blade of a kitchen knife--``and 
cauterized the wound.''
  Now, cauterization means that he took that hot blade without any 
anesthesia, without antiseptic, and he placed this hot blade on the 
skin of this baby--a hot blade--to save her life.
  Can you imagine the screams? Can you imagine the heartache that the 
parents felt as they saw this happening to their baby? But they knew 
this was necessary. This is a lifesaving technique, a hot blade--
``heated the blade of a kitchen knife and cauterized the wound.''
  She is more than a statistic. She is a human being, and she deserves 
to have someone recognize her humanity.
  ``Within days, the gash ran with pus and began to smell.'' She 
suffered the hot blade, and now the gash is smelling, running with pus.
  ``By mid-December, when Gazal's family arrived at Nasser Medical 
Center,'' which has been rendered dysfunctional now, I believe. If it 
is not, it has been brought back online, but it was.
  Gazal's family took her to this medical center. It was, at the time, 
the largest functioning healthcare facility, but when they got there, 
gangrene had set in.
  First, she is wounded. Then, she suffers a hot blade. Now, she has 
gangrene, necessitating amputation at the hip.
  Mr. Speaker, we are talking about the baby in this picture. Let's 
humanize her.
  ``On December 17, a projectile hit the children's ward of Nasser,'' 
meaning this hospital. ``Gazal and her mother watched it enter their 
room.''
  Here is the mother with her daughter, having suffered cauterization 
with the blade of a hot kitchen knife, now in the hospital, and they 
witness the projectile coming into the ward where the baby is. A 
projectile hit the ward.
  ``Gazal and her mother watched it enter their room, decapitating 
Gazal's 12-year-old roommate and causing the ceiling to collapse.''
  This is a baby who has suffered more than any human being should, and 
now, while in the hospital, a projectile comes into the ward where she 
is. This projectile decapitates her 12-year-old roommate.
  We have to humanize, not statisticize.
  This caused the ceiling to collapse.
  ``Multiple news reports have described the event as an Israeli 
attack. The IDF claimed the incident could have been caused by a Hamas 
mortar or the remnant of an Israeli flare.''
  This is what The New Yorker is quoting, someone with the IDF, the 
Israeli Defense Force. This person is indicating that it could have 
been a mortar from Hamas, or it could have been the remnant of an 
Israeli flare.

  ``Gazal and her mother managed to crawl out of the rubble. The next 
day, their names were added to the list of evacuees who could cross the 
border into Egypt and then fly to Qatar for medical treatment.''
  This is her now in Qatar. Her mother got her out.
  ``Gazal's mother was 9 months pregnant.''
  The mother, whose daughter has suffered incalculable pain, was 9 
months pregnant. She gave birth to a baby girl while awaiting the 
airlift.
  All of this time, this mother was pregnant--while having her daughter 
suffer the blade of a hot knife to save her life and then taking her 
daughter to a hospital where a projectile enters the room and 
decapitates another baby--12 years old--in that room.
  Now, this baby sees all of this. She is a witness to this. Can you 
imagine what her life will be like, the trauma she will suffer?
  Mr. Speaker, we have to humanize these lives. This is not just 
another casualty of war. This is a human being.
  UNICEF estimates that 1,000 children in Gaza have become amputees. 
This baby represents one of a thousand--probably more than that now.
  This baby has to be humanized.
  This article indicates: ``This is the biggest cohort of pediatric 
amputees in history.''
  This is happening in Gaza, the biggest cohort of pediatric amputees 
in history. We call these casualties of war. This baby is just another 
casualty of war--the biggest cohort in history. She is more than a 
casualty of war. She is a human being.
  I now move to another story that should be humanized. This one is 
from CNN, a fairly reputable news source. The style of this article is: 
``At least 13 killed, including 7 children, after strike on Gaza's Al-
Maghazi refugee camp.''
  Mr. Speaker, 13 killed, including 7 children. This didn't happen a 
month ago. This didn't happen 2 months ago. This happened on April 16.

                              {time}  1200

  That is in the very recent past. ``At least 13 people, it reads, were 
killed, including 7 children, and more than 25 injured after a strike 
targeted Al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza on Tuesday, according 
to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital officials.
  ``Graphic video obtained exclusively by CNN from eyewitness Nihad 
Owdetallah, shows several casualties scattered on the floor, including 
children, with blood streaming around the area.''
  This was Tuesday. This was the Tuesday sometime after what happened 
in Israel as it relates to Iran. This happens in Gaza as the Netanyahu 
administration is planning a response to what happened with Iran.
  How do you think these people feel? What about them? Are we now going 
to just forget them? We will just go on to the next fight, and these 
thousands, tens of thousands, over 30,000, just sort of put them in the 
past? I will not.
  There has to be some justice for these children. What is happening to 
them is an injustice. You cannot, in the name of justice, create an 
injustice and call it justice. An injustice in the name of justice is 
still an injustice. This is an injustice, and it is continuing after 
Prime Minister Netanyahu has indicated that he wants justice for what 
happened to Israel. How can we just let this become a thing of the 
past? I refuse to allow it to be a thing of the past.
  The video shows several casualties spread on the floor, including 
children with blood streaming around the area.
  ``Dozens of people appear to be running around in panic, screaming 
and trying to count and carry the dead bodies. A foosball table covered 
in dust is seen among the dead bodies.''
  The witness, who lives in the camp, told CNN he heard an explosion 
around 3:40 p.m. local time on Tuesday around 30 to 40 meters away from 
him. This is his quotation: ``I immediately walked to see what happened 
and found dead bodies thrown on the ground. People screaming, kids 
screaming. Kids dead on the ground. They were just playing foosball, 
and they were martyred.
  ``Footage shot for CNN from inside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital shows a 
continuous flow of casualties and injured people being ushered in, as 
the emergency room is crowded with patients,

[[Page H2516]]

including several wounded children, crying out on the floor''--
children.
  Let's go back to the style of this article: ``At least 13 killed, 
including 7 children, after strike on Gaza's Al-Maghazi refugee camp.''
  ``The emergency room is crowded with patients, including several 
wounded children, crying out on the floor. Family members are seen 
crowding over their loved one's dead bodies, kissing them, holding onto 
them and sobbing.''
  These are human beings. They do what human beings do when they suffer 
these kinds of tragedies.
  ``Video from inside a morgue at the hospital shows families trying to 
identify their loved ones among the deceased. Fatmeh Issa points to a 
white body bag with a young boy's bloodied face exposed, telling CNN, 
`This is my son.''' A young boy's bloodied face exposed in a white body 
bag, ``This is my son,'' she says.
  ``Another man cries out, `They have nothing to do with anyone. They 
are civilians. Have mercy on us.'''
  These people are pleading, appealing to us. I say ``us,'' because our 
fingerprints are all over this. The munitions being used are in some 
part related to the largesse that we send to the Netanyahu 
administration. That largesse is the link to us, and we have to do 
something about it.
  ``Have mercy on us. You are killing children. You are not killing an 
army or fighters. . . . `'
  Remember earlier, I said the war was declared on Hamas, not 
Palestinians, not Palestine? Here is a validation of the thinking of 
the people in Gaza. These people understand what is going on. ``You are 
killing children. You are not killing an army or fighters; you are 
killing children who were peacefully playing in the street.''
  They are children playing in the street. One moment they are children 
running and doing the things that children do, laughing. The next 
moment, seven are dead. You are killing children who were peacefully 
playing in the street, not an army, not fighters.
  ``Video shows him handing a young girl's dead body to another man, 
both men crying out Quranic verses and sobbing. The man who receives 
her body is seen placing her on the ground, and covers her body with a 
jacket, telling CNN she is his daughter.''
  Human beings dying and suffering, suffering and then dying and those 
left behind suffering.
  This war has to cease. It has got to stop. We ought to be among the 
first to say it has got to stop.
  Do you think history is going to be kind to us? Posterity is not 
going to be kind to the Netanyahu administration. We will be seen as 
persons who were eyewitnesses by way of television to a great human 
tragedy and did not do what we could to prevent it.
  Remember, the war was not declared on children. It wasn't declared on 
women. It wasn't declared on innocent people. It was declared on Hamas, 
but we know that more than 30,000 Palestinians have lost their lives, 
some of them in horrific ways.
  There seems to be a means by which the mind can process a person 
dying as a result of an explosion from one of the bombs that we helped 
pay for. There seems to be a means by which the mind can process that 
and see that as something that is not as horrific as if you do it in 
many other ways. It was just a bomb. The person was just a casualty of 
war, just another number, that is all. We need to move on.
  My fear is just that, that at some point, Prime Minister Netanyahu 
will decide enough is enough, and we will then say he has now moved on.
  Do you think this baby will have moved on? Do you think her parents 
will have moved on? Do you think the people who are suffering now will 
have moved on? This is a rest of their lives incident.
  Incident? What a kind way to say it. This is a rest of their lives 
tragedy. This is a rest of their lives slaughtering of human beings. Do 
you think they can just move on?

  At some point on this infinite continuum that we call time, we are 
all going to have to account for our time. Somebody is going to have to 
account for this and the thousands of innocent people who lost their 
lives. It won't be simply: Well, I just cast a vote. I didn't do it. 
There is a connection. We have our fingerprints all over this, and we 
ought to do what we can to prevent it from continuing.
  The man who has said this is his daughter, he indicates: ``This is my 
oldest daughter . . . her name is Lujain. She is 9 years old.''
  This man has lost his 9-year-old daughter. It goes on to indicate: 
``A strike hit them while they were playing out in the street. They are 
all just children.''
  Mr. Speaker, I can't let it go. I am sorry. I can't. I wish I could, 
but I can't. These are babies. I can't let it go. I refuse to be a 
participant in this any longer. I have done it too long already. Too 
many babies have been killed. It has got to stop.
  Don't expect me to continue to fund this. Say what you want about me, 
but I am not going to continue to fund this killing of babies and then 
making them mere numbers.
  At some point, we have to come to our senses. Don't you see what we 
are doing to ourselves and our image in the world?

                              {time}  1215

  Don't you see what Mr. Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, is doing to 
Israel's image in the world?
  Israel had the moral high ground. It is losing it. Some would say it 
has lost it.
  Nonetheless, we are quick to return it if something happens in 
Israel. We are quick to return it: You now have it again.
  I refuse--I refuse--to continue to fund this kind of atrocious 
behavior.
  Voltaire was right: Those who can make you believe absurdities--
actually, it was: Those who can cause you to let's just say believe 
absurdities, there is another way he put it, but those who can cause 
you to believe absurdities can cause you to commit atrocities. That is 
not the exact word.
  We now believe the absurd notion that it is all right to kill 
innocent men, women, and especially children, if in that process we are 
trying to get to a dastard who is hiding behind these innocent men, 
women, and children.
  I refuse to continue to be part of this unbelievable killing of men, 
women, and children before our very eyes that we are funding. Now, 
someone would say: Well, the war in Ukraine, you are funding that.
  We might remember that Ukraine is defending itself in a war where 
there has been an invasion.
  I don't want war anywhere. Ukraine's innocent men, women, and 
children are being killed as well, but Russia is funding that. Russia 
has their fingerprints all over that, and I don't approve of what 
Russia is doing.
  That is easy for us to say in this country. It is easy for us to 
condemn Russia for what Russia is doing. We do it without hesitation 
and without equivocation. We do it with no consternation--just Russia, 
we can do it.
  Why?
  It is because it is easy to look through the window of life at 
someone else and say: What you are doing is wrong. It is not so easy to 
look into the mirror of life and see the wrong that you are doing 
yourself. At some point we have to confess to what we are seeing in the 
mirror of life. If we don't, then we will still be judged. I assure 
you, Mr. Speaker, history is not going to be kind to us for what is 
happening in Gaza.
  There are going to be people who are going to wonder: What was wrong 
with them? They saw it. They had evidence of it, and they still forged 
forward to get it over with. Finish it, they say. Finish it.
  Finish this?
  Get this over with?
  Mr. Speaker, do you think that will be over for her?
  I refuse to continue to support this.
  Now, there will be some who say: If you can't do this, then you ought 
not be there because we expect you to cast the votes to do this.
  Mr. Speaker, all I can say to that is: My conscience will dictate 
what I do. I will do what I must and let others do what they may.
  Do what you will. I have not suggested to one of you that you have to 
vote a certain way. I am just telling you how I am going to vote. I am 
telling you, Mr. Speaker, that history is not going to be kind to all 
of us, and that includes me.
  I voted for over $50 billion to go to the country of Israel. Not that 
very

[[Page H2517]]

long ago we voted more than $3 billion. I have been a supporter. I am 
still a supporter of the people. I am not a supporter of the Netanyahu 
administration. I support the people, not that administration, because 
what they are doing to the people of Gaza is ungodly. It is shameful. 
It is disgraceful. I will not support that.
  Let others do what they may. If there are people who believe so 
strongly about this in the Ninth Congressional District that they want 
somebody who will tolerate this and go along with this, then send them 
on up here and take me out because I don't go along with it. I am not 
going to go along so that I can get along, not when it comes to this.
  By the way, I am not a saint. I don't claim to be a saint. I just 
claim to be a person whose conscience dictates that I shall not support 
this kind of behavior.
  Mr. Speaker, I will close with this: Notwithstanding all that I have 
said, I still love my country. I am an American. I believe I am of 
African ancestry. I have not checked my bloodline to find out, I don't 
know, but I love this country. It means something to me to say to 
people that I am an American.
  I love it more than it has loved me. It segregated me. The rights 
that the Constitution recognized for me my friends and neighbors in the 
South took away from me, but I still love my country.
  How can you love your country when your country has treated you the 
way it has: the back of the bus, balcony of the movie, step off the 
sidewalk when people come by, separate line for you at the grocery 
store, and colored water fountains, how can you love it?
  It is because I love what it stands for and its noble ideals, the 
ideals of liberty and justice for all as extolled in the Pledge of 
Allegiance that we said at the genesis of this message. I love the 
ideal in the Declaration of Independence that all persons are created 
equal and endowed by their Creator with these inalienable rights, among 
them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
  This is why I have said that because I love these ideals, I believe 
we should export them to other people, but not export them in the sense 
that we want them to simply obey them and treat other people right, I 
think that is a good thing to do, but in the sense that we ought to 
respect her life, her liberty, and her desire to pursue happiness. We 
ought to respect her life. Export that to people across the globe, 
especially people who are trapped, trapped in Gaza and who can't get 
out. They have no place to go and are told to move from one place to 
another.
  Let's give them the benefit of these noble words: life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness. I will do so in every way that I can. I 
believe in this country, and I love it to the extent that I believe we 
ought to make that noble ideal real for people in this country 
and without this country, especially the people who are in Gaza.

  Mr. Speaker, as a proud Member of this Congress and a proud American 
in the sense that I love my country because of its great ideals, I 
yield back the balance of my time."

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Alabama for 
yielding me time. I am glad to see this body taking up my border 
security legislation today alongside these other important packages as 
well.
  Now, the gentleman from New York calls this a joke. Well, I don't 
know what he finds funny, but nothing about this situation is funny. It 
is not funny to our Border Patrol agents; it is not funny to my border 
communities; and it is certainly not funny to the hundreds of thousands 
of women and children being trafficked by the Mexican cartels at our 
southern border. There is nothing funny about this situation.
  Let's be clear: Our border is broken and has been for a long time. At 
a time where our world is more dangerous than ever and our adversaries 
are emboldened, protecting our homeland is our most critical priority. 
Attacks by our adversaries have spurred the urgent need to support our 
allies. Congress should be able and must do both, and it all starts 
with a secure border, Mr. Speaker.
  This bill takes major strides in addressing our porous border. It 
would immediately restart construction of the border wall, end the 
disastrous catch and release policies, and streamline the asylum 
process. We have seen policies that work, including remain in Mexico 
and Asylum Cooperative Agreements in the Northern Triangle. This bill 
would start the process of going back to those policies and, in turn, 
stem the flow we are seeing.
  The United States Congress is the most powerful body in the world. We 
must be able to support our allies while we protect our homeland as 
well.
  The world is looking to America for strength, and our country is 
looking to Washington for leadership. The administration is nowhere to 
be found, has been nowhere to be found. We must step up and fill the 
gaps the White House has left by their weakened foreign and domestic 
policy stances.
  Since January of 2021, there have been more than 7.6 million migrant 
encounters at our southwestern border. In addition to this staggering 
7.6 million, estimates suggest upwards of 1.8 million additional 
illegal immigrants that evaded Border Patrol and entered our country. 
Most notably, 169 individuals on the terrorist watch list were 
apprehended at the border in FY23.
  These are no longer just families coming to America in search of a 
better life. In FY24 so far, we have witnessed over 20,000 Chinese 
nationals at the southwest border. Encounters of Chinese nationals have 
already surpassed all of last fiscal year.
  I recently went to Israel and personally walked through the 
devastation of October 7. Make no mistake, Hamas wishes the same fate 
on Americans.
  This bill does not just address a major national security weakness, 
it solves a crisis that millions of Americans already live with. In my 
district alone, we have seen close to 1,000 migrants per day enter our 
communities. Arizonans have seen a spike in high-speed car chases and 
illicit activity by Mexican cartels.
  In FY 2023, fentanyl overdoses in the U.S. rose above 112,000. 
Fentanyl overdose death is becoming the number one cause of death among 
young people in my home county of Pima County.

                              {time}  1130

  Mr. CISCOMANI. My colleagues from New York to Oregon have seen the 
effects of our border crisis in their own communities. We must send the 
signal that the U.S. southern border is not open. Our adversaries, 
whether it is the Mexican cartels or the CCP, will seize any moment to 
take advantage of American weakness.
  Each of these packages take a firm stance to stand with our allies in 
Israel, Taiwan, and Ukraine. In turn, my bill takes a firm stance on 
America's strength in our homeland. Mr. Speaker, this is personal to 
me. Not only is it the number one issue in my district, it is the 
number one issue for Republicans and Democrats in my district as well.
  I am a third-generation American. I immigrated here with my family 
when I was a young boy. Today, the open-border policies of the Biden 
administration are not the way of the American dream. It dilutes and 
diminishes the efforts and sacrifice of so many immigrants that came 
before us to open the way, invest in this country, and became 
Americans.
  It is fueling human trafficking and enabling the cartels and flooding 
our country with fentanyl and other deadly drugs. America is the land 
of opportunity. I believe that. I am a proud product of the American 
dream, living it every single day, Mr. Speaker. But the crisis at our 
southern border is not the American Dream. It is a nightmare. We must 
take steps to secure our southern border immediately. This legislation 
is a start. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson).
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
New York for giving me the time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in a strong opposition to this sideshow. 
Consideration of H.R. 3602 today is a cynical move meant to appease 
Republicans who refuse to provide aid to fight autocrats and terrorists 
unless they get to deport migrant kids first. These extreme MAGA 
Republicans care more about scoring political points than finding 
solutions and refuse to consider the bipartisan Senate border security 
and immigration enforcement bill.
  They are having a hissy fit after the Senate threw out their 
unconstitutional Articles of Impeachment against the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas. They care only about electing 
Donald Trump, and they are happy to rip up the Constitution, create 
chaos at the border and prop up Vladimir Putin to do it. This is why 
they are insisting on rehashing this terrible bill, which has zero 
chance of passing the House, let alone the Senate
  H.R. 3602 shifts all border processing to ports of entry without 
providing any additional resources. The bill doesn't fund a single new 
officer at ports of entry where more than 90 percent of fentanyl is 
interdicted. Our ports of entry are already short over 4,000 officers.
  When the Committee on Homeland Security considered a version of this 
bill last year, Democrats tried to add an additional 1,700 officers, 
but Republicans refused. Furthermore, this xenophobic bill would strip 
DHS funding from any community or religious organization that helped 
migrants. It is so overly broad that organizations that place water in 
remote areas of the desert or provide a pregnant mother a safe place to 
sleep would be ineligible for DHS funding. This bill is so 
overreaching, that it would force the American Red Cross----
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Mississippi.
  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding me extra time. This bill is so overreaching that it would 
force the American Red Cross to verify every person's immigration 
status before providing lifesaving services following a natural 
disaster. This is just inhumane.
  Furthermore, H.R. 3602 is so poorly drafted that it would bar many 
U.S. citizens from boarding commercial flights. This bill sets 
requirements for forms of identification that can only be used through 
airport security, but the list doesn't include a driver's license from 
Washington, D.C.; Puerto Rico; Guam; or other U.S. territories.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill is too extreme. It is just brought here today 
to appease certain elements of the party. Remote Republicans must put 
an end to this chaos and dysfunction, and get back to serious 
legislating. Vote ``no'' on this unworkable bill.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), my good friend and chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee.
  Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, the Democrats called this bill a joke. It is not a joke 
to put back in place the policies that worked. In fact, I would call 
that common sense. Remember what happened on day 1 of the Biden 
administration? They said we are going to get rid of the remain in 
Mexico policy, we are going to stop building the wall, and when you get 
here, you will be released. Well, who the heck wouldn't come if that is 
the policy? That is exactly what has

[[Page H2552]]

happened, and we are on pace to get to 12 million migrants entering the 
country in the Biden administration. So this bill fixes those things.
  It says we are going to build the wall, provide money to do so. We 
are going to put back in place the remain in Mexico policy, which 
worked. We are going to end this catch and release. Guess what else it 
does? Guess what else it does? It changes the way they are doing 
parole, the very program this administration put in that allowed the 
individual to be released into the country who killed Laken Riley. That 
is not a joke. That is good policy, policy that will help protect 
Americans, policies that make common sense.
  So I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Moore) for sponsoring 
this legislation, for managing it on the floor, and the Judiciary 
Committee who has worked on this, the Republicans on the Judiciary 
Committee who have worked on this for a long time. This isn't quite 
H.R. 2, but it is close, and it is the policies that need to happen.

  Again, understand the magnitude of the problem. We are on pace to get 
to 12 million migrants coming in this country in a 4-year time span. 
That is what the Biden administration has given us. Everyone knows that 
is wrong. Everyone knows the policies they have done intentionally, 
deliberately willfully on day 1 have been harmful to the country. 
Democrats know it. Republicans know it. Independents know it. Polling 
shows it all across the country. Let's take a step in the direction of 
fixing it and pass this legislation.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement.
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this cruel, 
unworkable and inhumane modified version of the Republican border bill 
H.R. 2. What is the point of this exercise? The majority could barely 
pass this legislation last year over bipartisan opposition, and now it 
is going to magically pass it in the House with a two-thirds majority. 
Give me a break. That is not what is happening here.
  They say when someone shows you who they are, you should believe them 
the first time. Well, the majority has shown us who they are on this 
issue over and over and over again. They consistently reject bipartisan 
solutions, including a bill that was drafted in the Senate by the 
second most conservative Republican Senator. Yet, the majority and 
Republicans in the House and the Senate decided to kill that bill.
  You know why? Because Donald Trump said kill the bill because we want 
to keep immigration out there as an issue that doesn't get solved, 
doesn't have any solutions, but has some empty talking point messaging 
bills that continue to demonize immigrants and create xenophobia in a 
country that has depended on immigrants to build this country and 
continues to.
  Republicans have said it out loud over and over again. They don't 
want solutions. They don't want to solve problems. They just want to 
preserve the issue for the election. This bill is going nowhere. Let's 
just be clear about that. The situation at the border is directly 
linked to the fact that the legal immigration system has been left in 
chaos because it has not been modernized in 30 years to meet the needs 
of this country.
  Who has stopped that modernization? Republicans have stopped it over 
and over again; when the legal process is so backed up that it takes 
decades for legal residents to get their children into the country, 
when employers can't simply get the workers that they need to hire 
approved because there is a backlog of 2 million people who haven't 
been processed or when we have so few immigration judges that asylum 
seekers wait for over 8 years to get their cases heard.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Washington.
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, when asylum seekers wait 8 years to get 
their cases heard, then, yes, people turn to unscrupulous actors, 
including cartels, who promise them get in by going to the border. The 
only people talking about the open border and encouraging people to 
come across the border are Republicans who continue to put that message 
out there.
  Are we looking for solutions, Mr. Speaker? No, we are here debating a 
bill that has no chance of becoming law and is an empty messaging bill 
that does absolutely nothing to reform our outdated immigration system. 
Let's get back to governing.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Roy), my friend from another border State.
  Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Alabama for yielding. 
The gentlewoman is right, in part, in that we are here for two reasons. 
Yes, this bill will not become law--there is no question about that--
and it will not become law for two reasons.
  The first reason is that our Democratic colleagues refuse to address 
the crisis at the border, and in fact, want to perpetuate it, encourage 
it, and cause more of it. The second reason it is not going to become 
law is because Republicans continue to campaign on securing the border 
and then refuse to use any leverage to actually secure the border. That 
is the reason; those two reasons right there.
  That is why this will not become law. Let's be very clear with what 
we are dealing with here right now. We know the numbers. We can talk 
about the numbers, the 7 million that have been released into the 
country, the 2 million plus got-aways, the extent to which we have had 
a thousand pounds of fentanyl pouring across our border every month for 
the last 6 months, the 24,000 Chinese nationals, the 85 percent of whom 
are adult single individuals that have come across this border 
since October 1, which is more than the entirety of fiscal year 2023, 
and certainly more than the 381 in the last year when the policies of 
President Trump were in place

  The reality is that we are being put in danger. The American people 
are getting killed. Laken Riley is dead because of policies of the 
Biden administration, specifically the parole policies that release 
people into our country to kill Americans.
  That is what has been happening. Yet, we are going to do nothing 
about it. We have legislation right now that would fix the problem in 
significant part. H.R. 2, we passed it a year ago. It is a great bill. 
I support the bill. I support what is in it. It changes the policies, 
frankly policies that President Obama and Jeh Johnson asked us to 
change, like TVPRA and Flores. It changes the policies of abuse of 
parole and asylum by this administration.
  We should get it signed into law. The only way to force Democrats to 
do it is to use leverage, and we are not going to. Despite the fact 
that the Speaker of the House repeatedly has said in January at the 
border, a trip I didn't take because I knew full well what would 
happen, it would be a show trip. That is exactly the truth. If 
President Biden wants a supplemental spending bill focused on national 
security, it better begin with defending America's national security.
  We wanted to get the border closed and secured first. He said in a 
letter in December, supplemental Ukraine funding is dependent upon 
enactment of transformative change to our Nation's border security 
laws. Well, here we are today with a sham vote. Let me be very clear, 
the people saying that we stopped H.R. 2 in the Rules Committee and 
didn't allow it to get connected to or allowed to be attached to the 
Ukraine bill, they are lying. That is not true. It was a separate rule, 
a separate vote designed as cover, cover for Republicans to try to vote 
for a Ukraine funding bill without securing the border of the United 
States. Yes, I do agree with that point, that is the truth.

                              {time}  1145

  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).
  Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Roy, the histrionics and the hyperbole are not 
working. You said so yourself.
  It is not working. It is not working.
  The bottom line is that we face issues that are very serious in our 
country, including the border. There is a crisis there, and we have to 
address it by doing what we are doing today and tomorrow related to the 
foreign aid bill.

[[Page H2553]]

  We have to work together. We have to find compromise. We have to find 
bipartisan solutions.
  Every problem we face in our country is complicated, and you cannot 
solve complicated problems in an environment of fear and anger. People 
have to sit down and work with each other.
  I know Mr. Moore is a very good man. There are a lot of good people 
on the Republican side as well as the Democratic side. Let's work 
together to solve these very serious issues we face in our country.
  We had a bipartisan solution by one of the most ethical, honest, 
hardworking conservative Republicans in the United States Senate, James 
Lankford. We didn't go forward with that bipartisan bill because 
President Trump and others said that we don't want to give Biden the 
victory, that we want to campaign on the chaos.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from New York.
  Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, they said we don't want to go forward on 
that bill because we want to campaign on the chaos, and we don't want 
to give victory to the Democrats.
  It is not a victory for Biden or for the Democrats. It is a victory 
for the United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker, for us to move forward as a country, we have to work 
together.
  I see the people up here in the gallery. People watch television, and 
they read the newspaper. They are sick of this. They don't want us 
fighting with each other. They don't want us with the histrionics and 
the hyperbole. They want us to sit down and negotiate a settlement.
  H.R. 2 was tried before. It didn't work.
  Let's say you get everything you want. Let's say Trump gets elected. 
Let's say that you win the House, the Senate. I don't want that to 
happen, obviously, but let's say you get everything you want. You won't 
get enough votes in the Senate. You will still have to negotiate a 
bipartisan compromise.
  People have to learn to get back to the basics of legislating, 
negotiating, and working together to solve the problems that the people 
of America demand that we solve.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair, and the Chair would remind Members that the rules do not 
allow references to persons in the gallery.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my friend.
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I will say this about the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Nadler), that he is right on some points, but he is wrong on 
some points, as well.
  One of them is this: This bill gives money to the States to deal with 
the calamity that has been caused by the Biden administration.
  Mr. Speaker, years ago, Janet Napolitano, who was in the Biden 
administration in the same position that Secretary Mayorkas is in, 
demanded that the Federal Government pay for the damages caused by 
illegal migration at that time. She understood. Just like Katie Hobbs, 
who is the current Democratic Governor of Arizona, says, we have to 
have resources. Please understand that you don't understand what is 
going on on the border.
  I will say one thing, that my friend from New York is correct that 
this is a show vote.
  H.R. 2 has been sitting in the Senate. It should have passed. It 
would have taken care of 90 percent of the problems on the border. I 
know. I wrote most of those provisions, along with my friend, Chip Roy.
  I will tell you this: If we do not pass this, don't come to us if you 
are living in New York and say you are in trouble because you have 
perpetuated it.
  Mr. Speaker, this is the time to pass this piece of legislation. The 
process has been crappy, but this is the time to pass this legislation 
because it has to be done.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), my friend.
  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, duplicity. This is a lie. It is a deceit. It 
is trickery. It is chicanery. It is a fraud. It is a swindle. It is a 
scam.
  By design, Mr. Speaker, this is a pig in a poke. You don't even get 
the pig, though. You just get the bag.
  We told everybody that we are going to do border security and attach 
it to this bill, that this is all going to go to the Senate, and then 
the President is going to sign it. That is not going to happen.
  Border security is not in here. This is a separate bill designed to 
fail.
  You are getting a box sent to you in the mail that says, ``border 
security.'' If you are Laken Riley's parents, if you are Kate Steinle's 
parents, you are getting a box that says, ``border security.'' You open 
it up, and there is nothing in it.
  You are supposed to believe that we are doing something here, Mr. 
Speaker, but in reality, we are just tricking you and swindling the 
American people again. This is an abomination.
  Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote for the bill, but I want everybody to 
know it is a sham.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).
  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill.
  Mr. Speaker, for years now, this House Republican majority--and 
before we were a majority--has been calling on President Biden to 
secure America's border. We have been trying to engage President Biden 
in a negotiation to fix the problem.
  We put together legislation, and H.R. 2 has been mentioned by many, 
many people, the strongest border security bill that has passed 
Congress. It has been over in the Senate since last year, and they 
continue to ignore it because they have chosen to ignore the problem.
  You saw it play out just days ago in the Senate when we sent over 
Articles of Impeachment for Secretary Mayorkas, who has failed 
miserably in his job of protecting America's homeland. That is his job. 
He is the Homeland Security Secretary, and you have seen him here on 
Capitol Hill testifying that our border is secure. It would be 
laughable if it wasn't so insulting to millions of Americans who know 
that is a lie.
  Our border is not secure. In fact, since Joe Biden took office and 
took actions to open up our border, we have seen millions come across. 
Is it 8 million? Is it 10 million? The number we know is at least that 
high, if not higher.
  We know people on the terrorist watch list have come into our country 
because we have caught some of them, but we haven't caught all of them.
  We have seen thousands of Chinese nationals of military age coming 
into our country. Do you think they are coming in here to help be a 
part of the American Dream or coming to undermine it?
  We know the answer to that question, too, which is why we continue to 
press our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, our colleagues in 
the Senate, and of course Joe Biden in the White House to get serious 
about this issue, but they refuse to.
  We are not going to let this go. We are going to continue to bring 
this up. Mr. Ciscomani brought this bill forward, and we will continue 
this debate.
  If President Biden wants to ignore it, he knows, and the American 
people know, that President Biden has the legal authority today through 
executive action to secure the border because they watched him use that 
same executive action to open the border.
  He ended remain in Mexico, which we restore in this bill. He mandated 
catch and release on our Border Patrol agents, who want to secure our 
border.
  We talked to them. We have embedded with them. Many of us have gone 
down to the border and embedded with our Border Patrol agents. Mr. 
Speaker, they will tell you what is wrong.
  The things that are needed to fix and secure the border are in this 
bill, but President Biden doesn't want to fix it. He knows he can fix 
it with a pen today. He has chosen not to because the far-left 
elements, the radical elements of his party, want an open border, and 
they are clear about it.
  The President tries to act like he wants to secure the border, but 
then

[[Page H2554]]

when it comes time to actually negotiate, he is nowhere to be found.
  Ultimately, the voters of this country are going to have a say in 
November. Do they want a secure border or not? They have a clear 
choice.
  When Donald Trump was President, we had a secure border. He took 
those steps. Mexico didn't want remain in Mexico to be the policy at 
the time. That was asylum, by the way, which is what we are really 
talking about. It was President Trump who went back to Mexico and said: 
Either you are going to agree to this policy--it is a negotiation 
between two countries--or there are going to be consequences.
  He laid out those consequences. Lo and behold, Mexico saw the light. 
Mexico recognized it made a lot more sense to agree to that policy with 
President Trump than to suffer the consequences, so we got remain in 
Mexico. It started to solve the problem, and then he ended catch and 
release.
  He was building the wall. We funded this when we were a Republican 
majority working with President Trump. We funded construction of the 
wall, and hundreds of miles of wall were being built.
  Joe Biden comes into office, and on day one, he mandated the end, the 
halt, of that construction of that wall. The wall was working, and Joe 
Biden knows it. He ended it because he wanted the border open.
  Step by step, action by action, Joe Biden has opened the border. He 
refuses to negotiate with us on fixing the problem, but we are not 
going to walk away from this. We are going to continue to force this 
issue, to bring votes to the floor, to press the Senate to take this 
up.
  At the end of the day, if Joe Biden still wants to continue to block 
this, still wants to continue to keep the border open, the voters are 
going to have the ultimate say in November, and I don't think he is 
going to like the answer.
  He could do something about it right now. He refuses to. Ultimately, 
the people of this country will have a say if Joe Biden won't work with 
us, but we are going to continue to push it.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this piece of legislation that is so 
important to our national security.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, the hypocrisy in this Chamber is so thick, you could cut 
it with a knife. Mr. Scalise says H.R. 2 was sent to the Senate, and 
the Senate ignores the issue. The Senate didn't ignore the issue. The 
Senate negotiated, as was mentioned before, a very, very tough 
immigration bill--the toughest ever negotiated--by Senator Lankford, 
whose reputation is the second-most conservative Republican in the 
Senate.
  It didn't pass. Why? Because former President Trump said: Don't pass 
anything. Don't pass H.R. 2. Don't pass the Senate bill. I want an 
issue. I don't want this issue solved. I don't want a solution. I want 
an issue for the campaign.
  That is what the President said.
  Congressman Nehls got up and said the same thing. He said: Why should 
we give a win to a Democrat?
  So don't tell me that anyone is serious about H.R. 2. They are not.
  H.R. 2 is so draconian, the Senate would not give it more than 32 
votes. We know that. We know that H.R. 2 is a fiction in the Senate.
  We know that the Senate negotiated a very strong bill, but that bill 
could not advance because former President Trump said he didn't want 
it. He doesn't want anything to pass on this subject.
  So don't tell me that the Republicans want a strong immigration bill 
and that the Democrats want open borders. Nobody wants open borders.
  Mr. Speaker, there is something else. The Republicans rightly decry 
the catch-and-release policy, where someone claims asylum and is then 
released into the country for years until a trial date comes up to 
decide whether that asylum claim is valid and should be granted or 
whether the person should be deported.
  That really is intolerable, but President Biden proposed a solution. 
The solution is very simple. He proposed an appropriation--I forget the 
amount--but an appropriation that would be sufficient so that those 
trials would be held in a matter of weeks, not years.
  If someone claimed asylum, he has a right to claim it. He has a right 
to an adjudication. The adjudication would take place in several weeks. 
If the person's case was valid, asylum would be granted. If the 
person's claim was not granted, he would be swiftly deported.
  You wouldn't have what they call this invasion. It is not an 
invasion. This country is composed of people who came through 
immigration. In the 1900s, there were 10,000 a day. They created the 
current United States, probably the ancestors of most of the people in 
this country.
  Immigrants are not a curse. They are a blessing. We need them for our 
economy, but we need a legal system. The legal system can only occur if 
the adjudications can occur quickly. The President proposed the means 
of doing that, and the Republicans rejected that.
  They rejected that. They rejected the tough bill in the Senate 
because President Trump said: I don't want a solution. I want an issue 
for the campaign.

                              {time}  1200

  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
Jackson Lee).
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thought we would come here today and 
have a reasoned opportunity to address this question.
  Let me be very clear. I have been in this body long enough to say 
that we have had a time where Members have been here and we have had 
control of the border, in the interpretation that my Republicans might 
say. We have had a flow of immigrants. We have had processes, and we 
have had challenges. We have spoken to the issue of providing funding 
for these challenges.
  Here is what the issue is. The issue is that we have a past President 
who sees in his jurisdiction and career to block the flow of immigrants 
who are building and continuing to work with us in working on this 
Nation.
  They come from Ukraine. They may come from Israel. They may come from 
Palestine. They may come from Taiwan.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Newhouse). The time of the gentlewoman 
has expired.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, those individuals need processes and 
they need funding. We won't even give them war funding.
  As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I can tell you that 
the issue is that we are not bringing groups together who are fleeing 
persecution, which is what we are seeing in the individuals coming to 
the country now. They are fleeing persecution, and we want to reject--
we want to reject the funding.
  When I was on the Homeland Security Committee, we did not do that. We 
provided for the NGOs. It is shameful for us to think that we can live 
in this country and reject the NGOs, the nongovernmental entities, who 
are helping those who are in need.
  That is how we did our work. When we did our work, we would be able 
to solve the problems. Those problems would be helping NGOs. Those 
problems would be making sure that we gave dollars to the agencies like 
Catholic Charities. Can anyone believe that we don't give money to 
Catholic Charities anymore?
  The call that we have today, Mr. Speaker, and to my good friend, the 
whip of the House, working with our whip, the Honorable Katherine 
Clark----
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE.--is that we need to work to help those who are most 
desperate and most poor----
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE.--to be able to make a difference. We are not doing 
that. We are rejecting that. We need to help this Nation. We are not 
doing that.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is no longer recognized.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing.
  If House Republicans were serious about addressing the situation at 
the

[[Page H2555]]

border, they would work with Democrats on bipartisan legislation that 
could actually become law, as they did in the Senate. Time and again, 
Republicans have proven that they want the issue more than they want 
solutions.
  Here we are again taking up virtually the same draconian bill as 
before, knowing that if it actually passes the House, it will surely go 
nowhere in the Senate.
  In a Congress that has broken records for its chaos, dysfunction, and 
lack of accomplishments, this debate is one more for the record books.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose this cruel and inhumane bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time for closing.
  We had Sheriff Daniels in the Judiciary Committee a few months ago 
now, and he said he had never seen the border as secure as it was in 
2018 and never as broken as it is today. Our colleagues across the 
aisle often want to set the building on fire and then fund the fire 
department.
  We have solutions to the problem on the southern border. We are not 
trying to make this a political issue. It is an issue of our time. The 
American people see it.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3602, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Moore) that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 3602, as amended.
  The question was taken.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds 
being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.

Mr. Speaker, I will vote in support of H. Res. 
883, a non-binding resolution that condemns the use of a slogan that 
has been used by some individuals and groups for antisemitic purposes, 
including as a rallying cry to deny the right to self-determination of 
the Jewish people or even to eliminate the State of Israel from the 
Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.
  I believe the antisemitic use of this slogan should rightfully be 
condemned. For example, this slogan has been widely used by terrorist 
entities--including Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and 
Hezbollah--to encourage future attacks on Israel, the Jewish community 
and Jewish institutions. With antisemitism and antisemitic attacks on 
the rise in the U.S. and around the world, we must swiftly condemn 
antisemitism in all its forms.
  However, this resolution should have been written better. For 
example, H. Res. 883, fails to acknowledge that some who use the phrase 
do so to advocate for Palestinian liberation and equality, and others--
including some members of the Jewish community--use the phrase to 
advocate for an end to the Israeli control and annexation of the West 
Bank and Gaza. The resolution should have noted that this slogan is not 
always intended to be used as antisemitic and not all who use the 
phrase are antisemitic.
  As with other resolutions this Congress, H. Res. 883 also fails to 
condemn antisemitic acts from those on the far-right, including white 
nationalists who have increasingly promoted antisemitic conspiracy 
theories and have threatened the lives and livelihoods of Jewish 
Americans.
  H. Res. 883 also treats the slogan ``from the river to the sea'' as 
one-sided. However, this phrase has also been used by right-wing 
Israelis--including by Prime Minister Netanyahu himself in January--to 
deny the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.
  Let me be clear: I believe that both Israelis and Palestinians have a 
right to their own state. That's why I strongly support a two-state 
solution where Israelis and Palestinians recognize each other's right 
to live in peace and have prosperity.
  I also unequivocally condemn all forms of antisemitism, and I am 
appalled by the significant rise in antisemitism we've seen in recent 
years and especially after Hamas's October 7th terrorist attacks on 
Israel. If the House Republican majority were serious about tackling 
antisemitism, they would support President Biden's National Strategy to 
Counter Antisemitism, would quit trying to defund the Office of Civil 
Rights for Title VI enforcement which protects Jewish students, and 
would increase funding for the High-Risk Nonprofit Grant Program to 
secure Jewish institutions as a start. I urge House Republicans to 
prioritize real action to combat hate, rather than continue to waste 
time and resources on non-binding resolutions.
  That's why I've cosponsored legislation that thoughtfully and 
powerfully condemns the rise of antisemitism in the United States and 
calls on Congress to support the above substantive actions to tackle 
antisemitism, which congressional Republicans have so far refused to 
do."

  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and 
include extraneous material on H.R. 8038.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1160 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House 
on

[[Page H2562]]

the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 8038.
  The Chair appoints the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) to 
preside over the Committee of the Whole.

                              {time}  0905


                     In the Committee of the Whole

  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 8038) to authorize the President to impose certain sanctions with 
respect to Russia and Iran, and for other purposes, with Ms. Foxx in 
the chair.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the 
first time.
  General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 30 
minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or their respective 
designees.
  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) and the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. Meeks) each will control 15 minutes.
  The chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul).
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Chair, the most serious matters that any committee deals with 
are matters of war and peace. It is those votes that are the most 
consequential votes of your career.
  This is one of those moments. As Secretary Pompeo and General Keane 
recently wrote in a letter to Congress: `` . . . we write at a pivotal 
moment in our Nation's history to applaud your efforts to secure vital 
support to America's allies and to strengthen America's defenses.''
  They know that the world is on fire, from Putin's full-scale invasion 
of Ukraine; to Chairman Xi threatening Taiwan and the Pacific; to the 
Ayatollah rearing his ugly head, invading Israel through his proxies.
  The eyes of the world are upon us, and history will judge us by what 
we do here and now.
  I thank Speaker Johnson, who has been under enormous pressure. He has 
said he wants to be on the right side of history, and with this vote 
today, he absolutely is. He put the interests of the Nation above 
himself. He is truly a profile in courage.
  President Reagan taught us that peace is achieved through strength, 
and that is what this bill is about. It is about providing the 
deterrence so we don't have another war as we did during my father's 
generation, and that is why I titled it, ``The 21st Century Peace 
Through Strength Act.''
  This bill includes my REPO Act that allows the transfer of frozen 
Russian sovereign assets in the United States so that Putin pays for 
the war he started. This is not just morally the right thing to do, it 
is also the fiscally responsible thing to do on behalf of the American 
taxpayer. Let Putin pay for it.
  That is why President Trump's former economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, 
supports this provision.
  This bill also protects Americans, especially our children, from the 
malign influence of the Chinese Communist Party-controlled TikTok. This 
app is a spy balloon in Americans' phones. It is a modern-day Trojan 
horse of the CCP used to surveil and exploit Americans' personal 
information.
  This bill also includes the most comprehensive sanctions against Iran 
that Congress has ever passed, including sanctions on exports of 
Iranian energy. China has bought $80 billion worth of energy from Iran. 
Madam Chair, that is money that Iran is using to fund terror operations 
like the ones that we saw last weekend. This bill also imposes 
sanctions on anyone involved in Iran's drone and missile program.
  Think about this, Madam Chair: Iran makes the drones and the missiles 
that are bought by Russia to kill Ukrainians. As we saw last Saturday, 
Iran is also manufacturing these drones, with Russia's support, to kill 
Israelis. This must be stopped.
  As Reagan said: ``When it comes to keeping America strong, when it 
comes to keeping America great, when it comes to keeping America at 
peace, then none of us can afford to be simply a Democrat or a 
Republican. We must all stand united as Americans.''

  Once again today, we need to speak with one voice, as one Nation, 
especially when addressing our adversaries, for Putin is watching us, 
Chairman Xi is watching us, and the Ayatollah is watching us.
  Now is the time to act.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Chair, this is indeed a historic moment. Sometimes when we are 
living history, as we are today, we don't understand the significance 
of the actions, of the votes that we make on this House floor, and of 
the effect that it will have down the road for children yet unborn. 
This is a historic moment.
  Yesterday, one of the rarest things that has ever happened on this 
floor took place. Generally, in this body, it takes the majority party 
to pass its rule, and the minority party never votes for it. However, 
this moment is so big that House Democrats said: We are not playing 
politics with this. This is too important for our Nation's security. 
This is too important for our allies' security. This is too important 
for the free world's security.
  Therefore, we did something that we have never done before. We voted 
in a bipartisan way to pass the rule to get these bills on the floor. 
Quite frankly, I would have loved to have done this 2, 3, 4 months ago. 
However, this is a historic moment. Ukraine is now on the brink. The 
humanitarian catastrophes in Gaza and Sudan and Haiti and elsewhere 
require immediate aid.
  Israel faced an unprecedented, direct attack from Iran less than 1 
week ago, and we need to rebuild our industrial base and support a free 
and open Indo-Pacific.
  We stand here today, finally, doing the people's work; doing, as I 
said just a few minutes ago, what we should have done months ago--
supporting our friends, supporting our allies around the world, and 
quieting the doubts about whether America is a reliable partner or not; 
whether the United States will continue leading on the world stage or 
not. I am so proud of President Biden because he has displayed that 
leadership time and time again.
  Now, today, we have a number of bills that we need to pass for our 
national security. On REPO, pertaining to the seizure of Russian 
sovereign assets, there is no doubt that Russia should pay for its 
crimes against humanity in Ukraine, as Vice President Harris has termed 
it. This bill, importantly, irons out legal questions that make sure 
that the United States does not act alone, but rather in coordination 
with our G7 and other partners, and we have seen President Biden pull 
them together immediately. Coordinating with our allies on this issue 
is important, not just for our standing as a paragon of the rule of 
law, but for our long-term economic interests.

                              {time}  0915

  There is an array of Middle East sanction bills included in this 
package, including several we voted on this week.
  Importantly, the majority agreed to add a humanitarian exception in 
three of those bills. I had been requesting that for a while. 
Fortunately and thankfully, we got it in now.
  I hope that, going forward, including these exceptions is a matter of 
course rather than something added via last-second negotiation, but I 
thank my friend, Chairman McCaul, for the good-faith negotiations on 
the Middle East section of this legislation.
  The Foreign Affairs Committee sanctions section is not perfect, but 
it does provide important humanitarian exceptions and waivers 
throughout the bill. Given the focus on the REPO bill the last few 
days, I will highlight that a key authority in the bill is permissive.
  I do not think that a sanction should be the opening salvo of 
diplomacy. Many may have heard me talking about how I believe in 
diplomacy so strongly, but sanctions are an important instrument of 
economic statecraft that can, on occasion, deter bad actors, curb human 
rights abuses, and promote diplomatic outcomes. I believe we lose our 
moral credibility if American sanctions are seen as causing 
indiscriminate deprivation, and we lose our policy flexibility if we 
tie the executive branch's hands instead of giving it useful tools.
  Yet, it is important that would-be invaders and dictators around the 
world

[[Page H2563]]

see they will face real consequences if they undermine the 
international order.
  This legislation also contains several bills in the Financial 
Services and Energy and Commerce lanes. Important changes were made to 
these bills.
  I had voted against H.R. 7521 on the floor out of concern that it 
would be a broad authorization that could be misused far beyond what we 
in Washington are currently debating, beyond just TikTok. However, I 
think the bill took a step in the right direction with a more realistic 
timeframe for a complex divestiture process.
  Let me say for the record that I believe this bill is about one 
company and that additional authorities provided to the executive 
branch are to be interpreted narrowly.
  Let me also take a moment to speak to those who oppose this 
legislation and say we can't support Ukraine in its fight against 
Russia's invasion because, to use their words, we are facing an 
invasion here at home. That is an absurd comparison.
  Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine because he wanted to topple the 
democratically elected Government of Ukraine and reconstitute the 
Soviet Union. He launched his unprovoked war of aggression with a 
willingness to kill millions of Ukrainians, not to mention his own 
forces.
  By contrast, people come to our border because of the tumult in their 
home countries or in search of a better life for themselves and their 
children. They do so because this is the greatest Nation, the greatest 
country, in the history of this planet.
  With all of our ills, with all of our faults, with all that we need 
to do, we come together. There is no question that the example that we 
show, by the people and the citizens of this great country, it is the 
greatest Nation on this planet.
  Today, once again, on this House floor, where we are right now, we 
are proving that fact by overcoming, by proving that this is the 
greatest country in the world, and by proving that we are the leaders 
of the free world. We are doing this by overcoming our partisan 
divides, by showing that we will work together and stand together, 
Democrats and Republicans, for the right thing and for our country.
  We are passing a historic bill, a bill that our children and 
grandchildren will be reading and looking at in the years to come. It 
promotes not just U.S. national security but the security of democracy 
over authoritarianism, law over lawlessness, and prosperity over chaos 
or famine.
  Madam Chair, the camera of history is rolling, and when they play it 
back, they will see we stood together. When they play it back, they 
will see that we stood for freedom, justice, and equality.
  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. HILL. Madam Chair, once again, dear friends, into the breach. We 
stand in the breach again for freedom. We stand in this historic 
Chamber with Washington on one side and Lafayette on the other.
  In 2 years, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of this country, 
this freedom, this democracy, which would not have happened without 
money from the Netherlands, money from France, guns from France, a navy 
from France. Allies stood at the side of the birth of this Nation.
  The birth of freedom was born here, so today, we come to this House 
floor to see that freedom is fought for here in this House.
  Last week, Prime Minister Kishida of Japan stood on this floor and 
called this Nation the indispensable Nation--not to do it alone, not to 
stand in the breach alone, but to lead. Today, the United States will 
once again step up and lead.
  Today, we will send the world the message: We stand with those who 
stand for freedom, and we hold to account those who are against 
freedom.
  This bill supports our allies. This bill condemns our rivals and our 
enemies.
  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.
  Madam Chair,
  America 250--in two years, this House will celebrate the 250th 
birthday of our Declaration of Independence.
  As Americans, we are all versed in our Founding, our struggles in the 
American revolution. We recall the lack of food and pay for our troops, 
the misery of winter at Valley Forge.
  What we must remember is that we did not win our independence alone.
  From 1775 through 1781, the United States would not have seen victory 
at Yorktown ending the American Revolution were it not for allied 
nations making a bet on the grit and tenacity of Colonial Americans 
taking on the world's largest army and navy. France, the bankers in 
Amsterdam, and the Spanish opposed Britain backed Washington's 
struggling ragtime army.
; Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 8038 
and today's vote to fund Benjamin Netanyahu's war in Gaza.
  All of us have seen the tragedy of Gaza. We have seen how Prime 
Minister Netanyahu's government has used American weapons to kill 
indiscriminately and to force famine, with over 25,000 women and 
children dead and tens of thousands of missiles and bombs levied on 
innocent civilians.
  We cannot escape what we see before us every day. That is the 
blessing of today's technology--TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, all of it. 
When we see it, we have to decide what we are going to do about it. Are 
we going to participate in that carnage or not? I choose not to.
  Prime Minister Netanyahu has been reckless. His actions have not led 
to the release of the remaining hostages. He has ignored the pleas of 
the families of hostages. He has ignored the pleas of the President of 
the United States. He has ignored his own people. He has engaged in 
self-preservation.
  We should not be sending offensive weapons to Israel right now, and I 
hope that this body will not.
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Lawler), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. LAWLER. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the 21st Century Peace 
through Strength Act.
  This bill reverses the Biden administration's relaxed stance toward 
Iran and China and starts to hold these bad actors accountable.
  Two of my bills, the SHIP Act and the Iran-China Energy Sanctions 
Act, are included in this package. Both of these bills target the 
illicit oil trade between Iran and China.
  One of my bills imposes sanctions on foreign ports and refineries 
that process Iranian oil, many of which are located in China.
  My other bill imposes sanctions on Chinese financial institutions 
that process transactions involving Iranian oil as well as anyone 
involved in Iran's missile and drone program.
  Iran is exporting millions of barrels of petroleum every day. Eighty 
percent of these exports go to China. Iran has taken in over $88 
billion from their illicit oil trade since President Biden took office, 
and they must not earn a cent more.
  To be clear, these illicit funds are used to fund Iran's regime of 
terror, including backing Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other 
terrorist groups, as well as their direct assault on Israel last 
weekend.
  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentleman from New York.
  Mr. LAWLER. Madam Chair, now is the time for America to lead, to 
support our allies, to combat our adversaries, and to continue our role 
as leader of the free world.
;Mr. McCAUL. Madam Chair, in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill 
described what he saw as the gathering storm, the forces of Hitler and 
the axis of evil threatening freedom and democracy.
  I recall when Mr. Meeks and I were on the border between Poland and 
Ukraine watching thousands of mothers and their children fleeing their 
own country in fear after the invasion. The Poles told us: This is just 
like 1939 when Hitler invaded Poland.
  Today, we are at a similar inflection point in history. The fall of 
Afghanistan sent a powerfully dangerous message to our adversaries that 
America was weak. Almost immediately after, the Russian Federation 
began moving toward Ukraine.
  Once Chairman Xi met with Putin at the Olympics and cemented their 
unholy alliance, they invaded. Chairman Xi has become more aggressive 
in the Pacific; and mark my words, Xi is watching what happens in 
Ukraine to determine whether he invades Taiwan in the Pacific.
  Then the Ayatollah raised his ugly head in the Middle East. Last 
Saturday, the world watched as Iran for the first time in history 
invaded Israel, sending 300 missiles and drones to kill innocent 
Israelis.
  These dictators, including North Korea, are all tied together. They 
are all tied together. We cannot separate them. We don't pick and 
choose our enemies; they choose us.
  My father served as a bombardier in World War II. He was part of the 
Greatest Generation. I recently took my son to the air base in England 
where my father was stationed. While there, we visited the church where 
my father prayed, not knowing if he would live or die.
  I took my son to the national cemetery for the U.S. airmen who never 
made it home, and I pointed to the 4,000 crosses and said: Son, those 
are the ones who did not make it home. In the chapel there is inscribed 
on the ceiling:

       In honor of the airmen who on their last flight met the 
     face of God.

  Met the face of God.
  It was a moving experience, father and son, teaching my son, like my 
father taught me, about the importance of patriotism and the cost of 
freedom. It was also a reminder of the dangers that we face today, for 
today like then, it could have been prevented. Deterrence is the key.
  As Churchill wrote in his book, ``The Gathering Storm:''
  ``One day, President Roosevelt told me that he was asking publicly 
for suggestions about what the war should be called. I said at once, 
`The Unnecessary War.' ''
  Think about that, the unnecessary war. He said: ``There never was a 
war more easy to stop than that which has just wrecked what was left of 
the world from the previous struggle.''
  I often think about the blood and treasure that could have been saved 
from my father's generation had we simply stopped Hitler earlier. Now 
we are faced with a similar opportunity.
  As Ronald Reagan told us: ``We know only too well that war comes not 
when the forces of freedom are strong, but when they are weak.''
  He was right. Our adversaries are working together to undermine our 
Western values and demean our democracy. We cannot be afraid at this 
moment in time. We cannot be afraid of our shadows. We must be strong. 
We have to do what is right. Evil is on the march.
  History is calling, and now is the time to act, for the world is 
watching. Our adversaries are watching us here today, and history will 
judge us all by our actions here today and now.
  As we deliberate on this vote, you have to ask yourself the question: 
Am I Chamberlain or am I Churchill?
  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.

        DIVISION L--ILLICIT CAPTAGON TRAFFICKING SUPPRESSION ACT

     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Illicit Captagon Trafficking 
     Suppression Act of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) Industrial scale production of the amphetamine-type 
     stimulant also known as captagon, and the illicit production 
     of precursor chemicals, in territories held by the regime of 
     President Bashar al Assad in Syria are becoming more 
     sophisticated and pose a severe challenge to regional and 
     international security.
       (2) Elements of the Government of Syria are key drivers of 
     illicit trafficking in captagon, with ministerial-level 
     complicity in production and smuggling, using other armed 
     groups such as Hizballah for technical and logistical support 
     in captagon production and trafficking.
       (3) As affiliates of the Government of Syria and other 
     actors seek to export captagon, they undermine regional 
     security by empowering a broad range of criminal networks, 
     militant groups, mafia syndicates, and autocratic 
     governments.

     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

       It is the policy of the United States to target 
     individuals, entities, and networks associated with the 
     Government of Syria to dismantle and degrade the 
     transnational criminal organizations, including narcotics 
     trafficking networks, associated with the regime of President 
     Bashar al Assad in Syria and Hizballah.

; Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. 
I would state the Constitution establishes Congress as a coequal 
branch. Time delays alone cannot be the reason to not move forward 
immediately.
  Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
McCaul) for his great work in defending Israel and supporting a 
sanction regime in Iran.
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for this 
amendment, and I support this amendment. It enhances congressional 
oversight as he talked about. Under Article I, we have a responsibility 
over restricted Iranian assets and accounts, including those in Qatar 
and Iraq.
  For too long, this administration has not been transparent with the 
Congress and the American people about sanctions and the like in 
reporting that to Congress, so I think this is a good step forward.
  Mr. NUNN of Iowa. Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).
  Mr. HILL. Madam Chair, I thank Mr. Nunn and Chairman McCaul for their 
leadership.
  Madam Chair, I stand in support of this amendment. We have to counter 
Iran's illicit use of funds any way we can to stop their reign of 
terror and their attack on our ally, Israel. The key to that is 
stopping their invasion of sanctions. These funds go directly to 
attacking our friends and partners, and Iran uses new and creative ways 
to do that.
  This amendment from Congressman Nunn ensures that we are stopping 
funds at the source by instructing the Treasury Department to examine 
the source and benefactor of all Iranian assets over $5 million.

support of the underlying bill.

proud to be a cosponsor of Representative Nunn's legislation, the 
Revoke Iranian Funding Act, that this came out of. In the wake of the 
appalling terrorist attack against Israel, it is clear that we must 
work to confront Iran and its surrogates in the region with a strong 
sanctions regime.
  Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, spending 
its money on terror, on developing nuclear capabilities, on taking 
hostages to use for bargaining purposes, and on funding the criminal 
IRGC.
  Among other provisions, this commonsense measure would provide 
transparency on which sanctions authorities the President is failing to 
exercise and where we can continue to cut off Iran's funding.

Mr. President, for months, the most elite corners of 
American higher education have made headlines for all the wrong 
reasons. Unfortunately, they are still finding new ways to embarrass 
themselves with vile, anti-Semitic radicalism, beginning, of course, 
with yet more alarming declarations like ``Burn Tel Aviv to the 
ground,'' ``Freedom for Palestine means death to America,'' ``The 7th 
of October is going to be every day for you.''
  The student radicals behind hateful chants like ``from the river to 
the sea'' have proven to be incoherently ecumenical. They have chanted 
``Long Live Hamas''--a Sunni terrorist group--and waved flags 
supporting the Shia terrorist group, Hezbollah, and the secular 
Marxist-Leninist terrorist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine.
  They have been joined on the picket lines by faculty members for whom 
radical anti-Semitism is merely an extension of their day jobs in post-
modern indoctrination.
  Last week, Columbia's encampment was even visited by a Member of 
Congress who accused some Jewish students of being ``pro-genocide.''
  It is unclear whether the student radicals or the shadowy groups 
organizing these disruptions are actual ``fifth columns'' for 
adversaries trying to corrode American society from within or just 
unwitting pawns. What is clear is that basic comprehension of history, 
theology, and geography is in very short supply in the Ivy League.
  But so-called elite universities aren't just in the news for a well-
documented decline in academic rigor. They are not drawing the Nation's 
attention just because another generation of students has decided to 
test the limits of the First Amendment with grotesque hate. No, no, 
they are in the news because weakness and inaction from campus leaders 
has allowed universities to become cauldrons of criminal chaos.
  In recent days, an Orthodox Jewish student at Yale was assaulted by 
organized hate-mongers. At MIT, there is a so-called ``liberated zone'' 
of radicals occupying the very center of campus. At UCLA, aspiring 
commissars have blocked Jewish students from walking to class or even 
entering the library. Another California school is reporting millions 
of dollars in damages after radicals vandalized campus buildings.
  And last night brought yet more evidence that administrators at 
Columbia have utterly--utterly--failed to bring order to their 
Manhattan campus. In the wee hours of the morning, the mob that has 
disrupted daily life from a tent encampment on the quad broke into a 
campus building with hammers and has barricaded itself inside.
  Not long ago, Columbia's president was sensibly calling in the New 
York Police Department to disperse and arrest these disrupters. This 
was a responsible thing to do because the vast majority of students at 
Columbia want to go to class, study for exams, and lead productive 
lives. But, then, her resolve appeared to give out. A minority of 
radicals and their faculty allies have used continued threats and 
intimidation to maximize the disruption and extend the reach of an 
odious ideology. The administration caved. The campus is now closed. 
But law enforcement remain outside the gates, and it remains to be seen 
whether administrators' latest threats of expulsion will actually be 
carried out.
  The situation at Columbia is so bad that a prominent rabbi urged 
Jewish students to leave campus out of fear for their physical safety. 
This is particularly discouraging at a university that for decades has 
been known as a welcoming home for Jewish students, even when the rest 
of the Ivy League systematically discriminated against them.
  Yesterday, a member of Columbia's Jewish community filed a class 
action lawsuit against the university, alleging sustained harassment 
and incitement of violence against Jewish students. In the absence of 
leadership from administrators, the community has had to take 
protection of their basic rights on campus literally into their own 
hands.
  Of course, today's campus radicals did not invent this brand of 
aggressive lawlessness. Here in the United States, they trace their 
roots back to the 1960s. Other countries, too, have had their own 
infamous histories of student intimidation and violence--most 
notoriously, the student Nazis of Weimar Germany.
  Education never has anything to do with it. It is about dangerous, 
radical politics. But just as the roots of this hate are not a mystery, 
neither is the way forward for college administrators.
  Leaders at Columbia might do well to note the approach of the 
administration over at Princeton, which has upheld clear prohibitions 
on activity like forming encampments and responded swiftly and severely 
to an attempt last night to occupy a campus building.
  They might also take a cue from our former colleague Ben Sasse. Thus 
far, radicals at the University of Florida have largely heeded his 
prohibition against unlawful disruptions because they know he means it. 
And, last night, those who failed to obey repeated warnings from campus 
police were promptly arrested. As an official statement put it, ``The 
University of Florida is not a daycare, and we do not treat protesters 
like children--they knew the rules, they broke the rules, and they'll 
face the consequences.''

  It is not enough for administrators to lament campus disorder. 
Strongly worded warnings only carry weight when they are backed up by 
action. The hateful ideas pouring out of campus encampments are not new 
to America's universities. The world's oldest form of hate has been 
alive and well in higher education for quite some time now. From the 
vile ``boycott, divest, and sanction'' movement that began over a 
decade ago to the establishment of outfits like the Rutgers Center for 
Security, Race and Rights, the forces of bigotry have been on the move.
  And those forces have powerful friends. President Biden's nominee for 
the Third Circuit, Adeel Mangi, has long been a patron of the Rutgers 
center. In fact, as new evidence indicates, he has played a much more 
active and enthusiastic role than he described to our colleagues on the 
Judiciary Committee.
  Apparently, every progressive organization in the country is 
furious--furious--that my colleagues and I have

[[Page S3071]]

dared to call attention to these disqualifying facts. So let's get it 
straight: Radicalism has no place in higher education or on the Federal 
bench.
  Unfortunately, the President doesn't seem to agree. While he defends 
Mr. Mangi and his radical associations, he refuses to render an 
unqualified rejection of campus anti-Semitism. In fact, when asked 
about it, he seemed to say: Well, there are good people on both sides.
  It is hard not to see this mealymouthed equivocation for what it is: 
a President prioritizing the feelings of his political supporters over 
moral clarity.
  Anti-Semitism is not a nuanced academic theory. It is not just one of 
many ``difficult viewpoints,'' as the White House Press Secretary 
seemed to suggest yesterday in reference to campus disruptions. It is 
not justified by political disagreements with Israel and its 
government. It is not entitled to take over campuses and make life 
miserable for Jewish students.
  Luckily, some reasonable observers are getting mugged by reality. 
Just as a growing number of Democrats are rejecting Mr. Mangi's 
nomination, a growing number of prominent Ivy League alumni are 
rejecting the surging radicalism of their alma maters.
  But that will only go so far. Leaders must lead. Administrators must 
take charge of their institutions. The basic objectives here couldn't 
be clearer: On campus, protect Jewish community members. Clear the 
encampments. Let students go to class and take their exams. And allow 
graduations to proceed.
  Here in Washington, withdraw radical nominees and force the 
Departments of Justice and Education to investigate civil rights 
violations.
  If moral clarity does not prevail--in the ivory tower and in the 
Biden administration--this could go down as a particularly shameful 
moment in our history.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their 
remarks.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from Minnesota?
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, we are here to debate the rule 
providing for consideration of six bills to support our natural 
resources, public lands, and outdoor recreation.
  The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by 
the Committee on Natural Resources and provides each bill one motion to

  The rule further provides for consideration of the Antisemitism 
Awareness Act under a closed rule, with 1 hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the Committee on the Judiciary and one motion 
to recommit.

  First and foremost, House Republicans stand with Israel and are 
horrified by the increase in harassment on college campuses toward 
Israel and its allies. For years, Jewish college students have faced 
increasing anti-Semitism, and since October 7 there has been an over 
300 percent increase in incidents on campuses.
  Students are supposed to be protected from harassment, but it has 
been made abundantly clear that the leaders of these institutions are 
not going to do anything to stop it. Instead, they are allowing large-
scale harassment to reign, forcing Jewish students to stay home.
  Since these institutions refuse to protect their students, it is time 
for Congress to take action. H.R. 6090 clearly defines anti-Semitism 
according to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working 
definition. This will empower universities to take clear steps to keep 
Jewish students safe and respond to hostile, hateful speech not 
protected under the First Amendment.
  Additionally, the bills under this rule protect domestic energy 
production; reverse the Biden administration's stop to push mineral 
production in my home State of Minnesota; and, finally, delist the gray 
wolf from the endangered species list. I am proud to stand in support 
of these today.
  The gray wolf is an ESA success story. Its numbers in most of the 
country are thriving to the point where they have become a menace 
across much of northern Minnesota. The only reason it has not been 
delisted as yet is because there are a handful of activist groups and 
judges that would like to keep it listed forever. Rather than pushing 
for radical environmental activism, we should be celebrating the fact 
that the ESA achieved its goal and gratefully turn management and 
conservation efforts back to the States.
  Madam Speaker, America is home to a wealth of natural resources, but 
this administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
continue to wage war on domestic production. From energy in Alaska to 
minerals in Minnesota, the bills under this rule empower our domestic 
producers.
; I thank Mr. Massie for his refreshing honesty and candor, but if we 
wanted to actually do something real, we could. Rather than doing a 
sticky trap, we could take up my colleague Congresswoman Manning's 
bipartisan bill, H.R. 7921, the Countering Anti-Semitism Act, which 
would designate a senior official at the Department of Education to 
counter anti-Semitism on college campuses, among many other solutions 
that are also based on Biden's policy regarding attacking anti-
Semitism. If we want to deal with anti-Semitism on college campuses, I 
suggest a bill with real solutions is a good place to start.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

                              {time}  1030

  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. Lawler).
  Mr. LAWLER. Madam Speaker, it is good to know that my Democratic 
colleague would rather children in Congo mine for cobalt than to create 
American jobs here and put in place environmental safeguards. I thank 
my colleague for putting that on the record.
  Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of the rule to bring my 
Antisemitism Awareness Act to the floor. I thank Chairman Burgess, 
Chairman Jordan, Leader Scalise, and Speaker Johnson for their support 
for consideration of this bill and their leadership in combating anti-
Semitism on college campuses.
  What is happening on college campuses right now is horrifying. We 
have seen folks at these encampments telling Jews to go back to Poland, 
as if they weren't kicked out of their homes, murdered in cold blood, 
and sent to death camps less than a century ago. The leader of the 
protest at Columbia called for death to Zionists. There was a sign at 
George Washington calling for a final solution, which was the name of 
Hitler's plan to exterminate Jews. People are shouting that they are 
Hamas and calling for the burning of Tel Aviv to the ground. They chant 
for intifada and ``from the river to the sea.''
  These are not peaceful protesters expressing their constitutional 
right to free speech. These are illegal encampments where demonstrators 
engage in harassment and urge violence against Jewish students, Jewish 
Americans, the U.S. Government, the Israeli Government, and more.
  I unequivocally condemn the college administrators who haven't acted 
to quell these encampments and who have enabled their campuses to 
become unsafe environments for Jewish students.
  At the Federal level, we must give the Department of Education the 
tools to identify and prosecute any anti-Semitic hate crimes committed 
and hold college administrators accountable for refusing to address 
anti-Semitism on their campuses.
  This legislation defines anti-Semitism using the IHRA working 
definition and its contemporary examples so that there can be no 
confusion or interpretation when it comes to the heinous act of 
discrimination and violation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act. It 
has broad bipartisan support in the House and Senate and 59 cosponsors 
in the House, including over a dozen Democrats.
  This is not about dividing Democrats. This has broad bipartisan 
support. If there are people in your Conference who embrace anti-
Semitism, that is not our fault. That is something you should be 
rooting out.
  When people engage in harassment or bullying of Jewish individuals, 
where they justify the killing of Jews or use blood libel or hold Jews 
collectively responsible for actions of the Israeli Government, that is 
anti-Semitic. There is no question about it.

[[Page H2707]]

  It is unfortunate that we need to clarify that these actions are 
anti-Semitic, but it makes this bill that much more necessary. What is 
happening at Columbia, Yale, UCLA, and so many other schools is 
reprehensible and alarming, but it cannot be discouraging.
  We must act so that the anti-Semitism on college campuses stops 
immediately. Our country's antidiscrimination laws must work for all of 
us, including Jewish students.
  My Democratic colleagues are tripping all over themselves because of 
electoral politics. They are worried about votes in Michigan and 
Minnesota and trying to placate a pro-Hamas element of their party, 
people who are parroting Hamas talking points.
  Literally, when I was at Columbia University last Wednesday with 
Speaker Johnson, Hamas endorsed the protesters on the campus grounds, 
saying that they are the future leaders of America. If those are the 
future leaders of America, God help us.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from New York.
  Mr. LAWLER. Madam Speaker, we should be very clear: Charlottesville 
was wrong. January 6 was wrong. Taking over a courthouse in Portland 
was wrong. Burning down a police station in Minneapolis was wrong. 
Breaking in and seizing control of the library at Columbia University 
is wrong.
  Let's call it all out and stop being a bunch of cowards. Anti-
Semitism needs to be rooted out, and any Member who votes against this 
bill should hang their head in shame.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, how dare the party of Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor 
Greene come down here and lecture Democrats about anti-Semitism. 
Remember, the leader of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, dines with 
Holocaust deniers and said there were ``fine people on both sides'' at 
a rally where white supremacists chanted: ``Jews will not replace us.'' 
Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared on stage at a white 
nationalist rally alongside a Holocaust denier. She tweeted anti-
Semitic videos and talks about Jewish space lasers.
  Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record an 
article from Politico titled: ``Donald Trump dined with white 
nationalist, Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes.''
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentlewoman from New Mexico?
  There was no objection.
;Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speaker, I would like to enter into the 
record, actually, my objection to this absurd attack on Democrats for 
pointing out that this bill has in the title ``anti-Semitism,'' but 
there are problems with it.
  We need to address anti-Semitism and look at the root causes. 
Instead, what are we doing? We are debating codifying a definition that 
numerous Jewish organizations, including Jewish Action, the Jewish 
Council for Public Affairs, and the New Israel Fund, among others, 
oppose.
  The reason these organizations oppose it is because we cannot equate 
criticism of Israeli policies with anti-Semitism. They are two very 
different things.
  We need to remember that we are constitutionally bound to protect 
free speech, even, and more importantly, when it is speech with which 
we do not agree.
  Yesterday, for example, in the Rules Committee hearing for this bill, 
Representative Fry called Prime Minister Netanyahu's work in Gaza 
remarkable. He praised it. I personally don't think it is remarkable 
that over 35,000 people, most of them children and women, are dead. I 
don't think it is remarkable that over 130 hostages are still not home.
  Netanyahu is being protested in his own country for these and many 
other things. I don't think it is remarkable that 27 kids have already 
died of malnutrition and that famine is imminent for 1.1 million 
Gazans.
  Saying none of this is anti-Semitic.
  I am Catholic with Sephardi heritage, and I think that my love that 
comes from the teaching and my spirituality calls upon me to talk about 
these things. That is not anti-Semitic.
  That is the worry that these Jewish organizations, ACLU, and others 
talk about today. If we really want to move forward on combating anti-
Semitism, let's fund the office that investigates and takes action 
against those colleges that fail to protect their students. Let's move 
forward with Congresswoman Manning's bipartisan bill, H.R. 7921, the 
Countering Antisemitism Act.
  We should investigate how these issues continue to seep into our 
schools and communities.
  We could do real work to address these root causes. Instead, we're 
debating a definition that numerous Jewish organizations, including 
Jewish Action, The Jewish Council for Public affairs, and the New 
Israel Fund, oppose.
  The reason these organizations oppose it is because we cannot equate 
criticism of Israeli policies with Antisemitism. That is free speech.
  Yesterday, in the Rules Committee Hearing for this very bill, 
Representative Fry called Prime Minister Netanyahu's work during this 
war ``remarkable.''
  I don't think it's remarkable that over 35,000 people are dead.
  I don't think it's remarkable that over 130 hostages are still not 
back home today.
  I don't think it's remarkable that 27 kids died of malnutrition or 
that Famine is imminent for 1.1 million Gazans
  Saying all of this could be construed as antisemitic if we adopt the 
definition we're debating today.
  That is not helping us move forward or address the scourge of 
antisemitism that's hurting our students and their families.
  To move us forward in the fight against antisemitism, we could 
consider Congresswoman Manning's bipartisan bill H.R. 7921, the 
Countering Antisemitism Act.
  This bill would designate a senior official at the Department of 
Education to counter antisemitism on college campuses, among other 
solutions.
  We could increase funding at the Office for Civil Rights so the 
office has the resources to actually investigate and address 
antisemitism on college campuses.
  If we want to deal with antisemitism on college campuses then I would 
suggest that these are good places to start.
;Madam Speaker, the gentleman on the other side of the aisle may 
recall that for a recent continuing resolution, he voted against a 
billion dollars in aid to Israel. The gentleman from New York voted 
against a billion-dollar increase in aid to Israel.
  If we defeat the previous question, I will bring up H.R. 17, the 
Paycheck Fairness Act, to ensure women are paid fairly for their work.
  On average, a woman still earns only 84 cents for every dollar that a 
man makes, according to the American Association of University Women. 
The disparity is even worse for women of color.
  The pay gap exists in every State, regardless of geography, 
occupation, education, or work patterns. This is not just a problem for a few years out of a woman's career. 
It is a systemic disadvantage that compounds over a lifetime. This gap 
can put women hundreds of thousands of dollars behind in earnings over 
their careers and, in turn, severely reduce the amount they receive 
from Social Security, pensions, or investments after their working 
years are over. That puts more strain on working families and our 
safety net as a whole to support them in their older years.
  Unequal pay is not just an issue of fairness. It is a major economic 
burden on families across the country.
  America is in a cost-of-living crisis for many reasons. Families are 
living paycheck to paycheck. They can't pay their bills. They can't put 
food on the table. They can't get the healthcare they need for 
themselves and their families.
  This cost-of-living issue, if you continue to deal with unequal 
payment for women in our workforce, only adds to economic insecurity.
  The pay gap persists because of loopholes in the Equal Pay Act. The 
Paycheck Fairness Act fixes those loopholes by mandating better data 
collection, protecting employees against retaliation for discussing 
wages or salaries, and removing obstacles to lawsuits that challenge 
systemic discrimination. In short, it gives the Equal Pay Act the teeth 
that it needs to get the job done.
  At the end of the day, it is really this simple: Men and women in the 
same job deserve the same pay. It is true in the House of 
Representatives, but not true pretty much everywhere else in this 
country. If we truly believe that, we should act on it.
  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question 
and the rule.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I am disturbed by my colleagues who 
are shameless enough to argue in favor of anti-Semitism. It is not 
covered by the First Amendment. It is hateful.
  Universities have been rewarding bad behavior and punishing the ones 
being attacked, who now don't feel safe enough to go to class. This 
cannot be the norm.
  I am disappointed in the universities that are standing by and 
allowing this and equally disappointed in my colleagues who do not see 
it as a problem.
  Stopping anti-Semitism is not a messaging tactic like the other side 
implies. Stopping anti-Semitism is something we must do.
  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
Miller).
  Mr. MILLER of Ohio. Madam Speaker, what is really sad for me is that, 
on both sides of the aisle, we have issues. I think some of my 
colleagues on my side of the aisle have Russian disinformation, and on 
the other side of the aisle, it seems that there is a lot of Hamas 
disinformation. I truly do not understand why it is so hard to just 
call it out. I digress.

                              {time}  1045

  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Antisemitism Awareness Act.
  Requiring the Department of Education to use the International 
Holocaust Remembrance Alliance working definition of anti-Semitism when 
enforcing Federal anti-discrimination laws will help to protect Jewish 
students across the country from violence and hate as we see it 
exploding every single day within our country.
  Anti-Semitism has spread like wildfire on college campuses, and it is 
rearing its ugly head in the wake of Hamas' ruthless attack on Israel.
  College students celebrate terrorists who brutally murder innocent 
civilians as martyrs, and faculty members call Hamas' assault 
exhilarating.
  When I saw a sign at the Columbia protest--if you want to call it a 
protest--the sign said: ``Free Palestine,'' and right next to it, it 
said: final solution.
  What does the ``final solution'' mean, I ask my colleagues across the 
aisle? I understand it is rhetorical, but you all know what final 
solution means.
  Me being just one of two Jewish Republicans in the House and in the 
Senate, that means the end of Israel and the Jewish people. That is why 
that is in the definition of the IHRA, to be abundantly clear.
  The abhorrent behavior underscores the clear need for Federal policy 
to protect Jewish students on these unfriendly campuses.
  Usage of the IHRA definition in this context is a key step in calling 
out anti-Semitism where it is and ensuring anti-Semitic hate crimes on 
college campuses are properly investigated and prosecuted. College 
campuses should be safe havens for learning, not nests of hatred.
  I urge my colleagues to say enough is enough and to support the 
Antisemitism Awareness Act.
  I will ask my other colleagues on the other side of the aisle just 
one more time. When you see a sign--and you are Jewish in this 
country--on a college campus, and you say that being an anti-Zionist is 
not being an anti-Semite--which being an anti-Zionist is being an anti-
Semite, to be very clear--but when you see ``final solution,'' I think 
you have a hard time accepting, especially when my family, almost two-
thirds of them, were annihilated at Auschwitz.
  We came to this country, and now my daughter is going to grow up in 
this world and look at a sign that says, ``final solution?''
  I speak for myself. I speak for no one else. It is abhorrent, and you 
all need to condemn this type of behavior and rhetoric that has 
consumed our country.
  Enough is enough. Please. Just be a human and put your politics and 
political affiliation aside for a second.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind Members on both sides 
of the aisle to address their remarks to the Chair and not to each 
other in the second person.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I just want to make the record clear. Democrats and President Biden 
have repeatedly and constantly, and not just since October 7, condemned 
anti-Semitism and taken actual actions to actually address it, and that 
is the problem with what we are hearing.
  As their own Rules Committee member has said it, these are about 
sticky bills. They are not about getting solutions.
  We must remember that most of the bills in the rule today are 
actually talking about our natural resources and how Republicans want 
to turn the clock back on the progress that Americans have been 
demanding for decades to protect our natural beauty but also to protect 
our natural resources for Americans.
  I want to talk a little bit about mining reform, a 1872 mining law 
that says it all. That law is way too old and needs fixing. Well, how 
do we make sure we go about fixing it?
  The Republicans' proposal is to just give more of it away. It makes 
it easier for foreign corporations and for big, greedy corporations to 
take that land, to take those natural resources.
  What do Democrats propose? We propose responsible mining reform that 
allows for critical minerals to be extracted without destroying our 
environment.
  My good friend and ranking member, the former chair of the House 
Natural Resources Committee, introduced the Clean Energy Minerals 
Reform Act, of which I am a cosponsor.
  That kind of bill would require annual rental payments for claimed 
public lands, treating mine operators the same way we treat oil and gas 
or any other ones. Let's make them pay for our resources. They belong 
to us.
  Imagine if the $300 billion in profits that is going to those foreign 
corporations went to Americans instead.
  We would set a royalty rate of not less than 5 percent and not 
greater than 8 percent, based on gross income.
  We would make sure that there would be a reclamation fund, so when 
the mining companies go in there and make their mess that there would 
be a way for us to clean it up.
  I can tell you, New Mexico is littered. In Colorado, all the 
intermountain areas are left with these abandoned mines that leach acid 
into our rivers and streams and make it so that we cannot hike and camp 
on those lands.
  I have picked up those rocks that when they are exposed to air and 
water create sulfuric acid, and they leave piles of them.
  Those are the things that we must be doing. We must give the 
Secretary of the Interior the right to protect our public lands, to 
protect the waters of Minnesota, right, and to protect the waters of 
this great country.

[[Page H2710]]

  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. Kean), my colleague.
  Mr. KEAN of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I thank Mrs. Fischbach from 
the Rules Committee for yielding me time.

  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and in support of 
H.R. 6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act, introduced by Mr. Lawler 
from New York.
  On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a brutal surprise attack on the 
State of Israel in which 1,200 Israeli citizens lost their lives. This 
represented the most significant attack on Israel since the Yom Kippur 
War.
  After those attacks, there was a massive increase and an outpouring 
of hatred toward the State of Israel and an increase in anti-Semitism.
  Let's look at the facts. According to data from the Anti-Defamation 
League, from October 7, 2023, until the end of last year, there were 
more than 5,204 anti-Semitic incidents tracked by the ADL--more than 
the whole of 2022 in more than 2 months.
  Unfortunately, there has been no greater breeding ground for anti-
Semitism than on the campuses of our Nation's colleges and 
universities.
  Jewish parents across my district and across this country are 
concerned for their children away at college.
  Jewish students should feel safe on college campuses. The anti-
Semitic actions on college campuses across this country and a muted 
response from university administrators is absolutely unacceptable.
  While I respect the right to free speech as guaranteed by the First 
Amendment, the situation on campuses across the country has simply 
gotten out of control.
  Unfortunately, the Biden administration has not taken the steps 
needed to adequately protect Jewish students, and I am glad that we, as 
Congress, are taking this important step.
  If colleges and universities are not willing to take the steps 
necessary to combat anti-Semitism and to protect their own students, we 
must ensure that there are consequences.
  Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the rule and passage of this bill.
  Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.

  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1173, I 
call up the bill (H.R. 6090) to provide for the consideration of a 
definition of antisemitism set forth by the International Holocaust 
Remembrance Alliance for the enforcement of Federal antidiscrimination 
laws concerning education programs or activities, and for other 
purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 1173, the bill 
is considered read.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 6090

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Antisemitism Awareness Act 
     of 2023''.

     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
     2000d et seq.), prohibits discrimination on the basis of 
     race, color, and national origin in programs and activities 
     receiving Federal financial assistance;
       (2) while such title does not cover discrimination based 
     solely on religion, individuals who face discrimination based 
     on actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic 
     characteristics do not lose protection under such title for 
     also being members of a group that share a common religion;
       (3) discrimination against Jews may give rise to a 
     violation of such title when the discrimination is based on 
     race, color, or national origin, which can include 
     discrimination based on actual or perceived shared ancestry 
     or ethnic characteristics;
       (4) it is the policy of the United States to enforce such 
     title against prohibited forms of discrimination rooted in 
     antisemitism as vigorously as against all other forms of 
     discrimination prohibited by such title; and
       (5) as noted in the U.S. National Strategy to Counter 
     Antisemitism issued by the White House on May 25, 2023, it is 
     critical to--
       (A) increase awareness and understanding of antisemitism, 
     including its threat to America;
       (B) improve safety and security for Jewish communities;
       (C) reverse the normalization of antisemitism and counter 
     antisemitic discrimination; and
       (D) expand communication and collaboration between 
     communities.

     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) Antisemitism is on the rise in the United States and is 
     impacting Jewish students in K-12 schools, colleges, and 
     universities.
       (2) The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance 
     (referred to in this Act as the ``IHRA'') Working Definition 
     of Antisemitism is a vital tool which helps individuals 
     understand and identify the various manifestations of 
     antisemitism.
       (3) On December 11, 2019, Executive Order 13899 extended 
     protections against discrimination under the Civil Rights Act 
     of 1964 to individuals subjected to antisemitism on college 
     and university campuses and tasked Federal agencies to 
     consider the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism when 
     enforcing title VI of such Act.
       (4) Since 2018, the Department of Education has used the 
     IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism when investigating 
     violations of that title VI.
       (5) The use of alternative definitions of antisemitism 
     impairs enforcement efforts by adding multiple standards and 
     may fail to identify many of the modern manifestations of 
     antisemitism.
       (6) The White House released the first-ever United States 
     National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism on May 25, 2023, 
     making clear

[[Page H2791]]

     that the fight against this hate is a national, bipartisan 
     priority that must be successfully conducted through a whole-
     of-government-and-society approach.

     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

       For purposes of this Act, the term ``definition of 
     antisemitism''--
       (1) means the definition of antisemitism adopted on May 26, 
     2016, by the IHRA, of which the United States is a member, 
     which definition has been adopted by the Department of State; 
     and
       (2) includes the ``[c]ontemporary examples of 
     antisemitism'' identified in the IHRA definition.

     SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION FOR TITLE VI OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS 
                   ACT OF 1964.

       In reviewing, investigating, or deciding whether there has 
     been a violation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
     (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) on the basis of race, color, or 
     national origin, based on an individual's actual or perceived 
     shared Jewish ancestry or Jewish ethnic characteristics, the 
     Department of Education shall take into consideration the 
     definition of antisemitism as part of the Department's 
     assessment of whether the practice was motivated by 
     antisemitic intent.

     SEC. 6. OTHER RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.

       (a) General Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act 
     shall be construed--
       (1) to expand the authority of the Secretary of Education;
       (2) to alter the standards pursuant to which the Department 
     of Education makes a determination that harassing conduct 
     amounts to actionable discrimination; or
       (3) to diminish or infringe upon the rights protected under 
     any other provision of law that is in effect as of the date 
     of enactment of this Act.
       (b) Constitutional Protections.--Nothing in this Act shall 
     be construed to diminish or infringe upon any right protected 
     under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
     States.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on the Judiciary or their respective designees.
  The gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) and the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. Nadler) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.


                             General Leave

  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material on H.R. 6090.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from California?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6090 is designed to combat the deeply disturbing 
trend of anti-Semitic harassment in schools, colleges, and universities 
across the country. We are seeing it unfold right now on our television 
screens.
  Anti-Semitic harassment on these university campuses is, 
unfortunately, not a completely new phenomenon. As early as 2005, the 
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights warned that campus anti-Semitism had 
become a serious problem.
  In 2013, a Pew Research Center survey of Jewish Americans found that 
experience with anti-Semitism was more prevalent among young adults in 
higher education.
  In 2014, a Brandeis Center-Trinity College study found that anti-
Semitism was particularly pervasive on college campuses, with 54 
percent of Jewish students on 55 campuses having reported that they 
experienced or witnessed anti-Semitism during the 2013-2014 academic 
year.
  In 2021, the Louis Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law 
conducted a survey of Jewish fraternity and sorority students, finding 
that most have felt unsafe at some point while on campus and in virtual 
campus settings. These fears are justified. The catalog of anti-Semitic 
harassment in America's top institutions of higher learning is there 
for everybody to see. Those incidents have increased sharply following 
the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks in Israel perpetrated by Hamas 
and its allied groups.
  In late October 2023, at Cooper Union in New York, visibly Jewish 
students were forced to shelter inside a library as pro-Palestinian 
protesters tried to gain entry, banging on doors and windows, with the 
purpose of terrifying them.
  On October 26, 2023, anti-Israel protesters assaulted multiple Jewish 
students at Tulane University in New Orleans.
  On November 3, 2023, a Harvard law student and other anti-Israel 
protesters physically and verbally attacked a first-year Israeli 
student at the Harvard Business School while he pleaded with them to 
stop.
  From October 7 until mid-January of 2024, the Department of Education 
has launched 51 investigations into complaints alleging discrimination 
based on actual or perceived shared ancestry in K-12 schools and 
colleges and universities.
  From January 16, 2024, until today, the Department has launched over 
45 investigations into schools and colleges. These investigations 
overwhelmingly concern anti-Semitic conduct in these schools.
  In fact, on April 23, 2024, the Education Department launched an 
investigation into Columbia University, and we all know what is 
happening there right now. Hundreds of anti-Israel protesters have 
occupied Columbia University's west lawn and erected dozens of tents, 
disrupting campus life and creating a hostile environment for 
Columbia's Jewish students. Hundreds of pro-Hamas students were 
arrested for trespassing after repeated warnings to vacate the area, 
only to be released and returned to Columbia.
  A rabbi at Columbia's Orthodox Union Jewish Learning Initiative has 
advised Jewish students to leave campus because the university has 
shown that it cannot keep them safe.
  Columbia revoked the campus access of a Jewish professor who has been 
critical of school administrators because the university said it 
couldn't ensure his safety.
  Speaker Johnson, Chairwoman Foxx, and Republican members of the New 
York delegation went to Columbia University last week and, while 
addressing the campus, were greeted by anti-Israel chants of: ``From 
the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.''
  What that calls for actually is the eradication of the Jewish people. 
We all know that expression is abhorrent in our society and, yet, it is 
going on, it seems now, hourly on our college campuses.
  Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. The surge in the ancient bigotry of 
anti-Semitism over the years, especially since October 7, must not 
continue. It is long past time that Congress act to protect Jewish 
Americans from the scourge of anti-Semitism on campuses around our 
country.
  The Antisemitism Awareness Act expresses the sense of Congress that 
discrimination against Jews may violate title VI of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 when it is based on race, color, or national origin, which 
can include discrimination based on actual or perceived shared ancestry 
or ethnic characteristics.
  The bill requires the Department of Education to take into account 
the 2016 International Holocaust Remembrance Act's definition of anti-
Semitism as part of its assessment of whether anti-Semitic 
discrimination has occurred. The IHRA definition provides a consistent 
framework for the Department of Education schools, colleges, and 
universities to apply to police anti-Semitic discrimination and 
harassment.
  The IHRA's definition is widely accepted and a vital tool for 
identifying and addressing discriminatory conduct that is motivated by 
anti-Semitism. It has been adopted by at least 31 States. This bill is 
exactly the type of legislation needed to protect Jewish Americans from 
harassment and attacks for simply being who they are.

  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I devoted much of my life to combating anti-Semitism, 
and I am as attuned as anyone to threats and bigotry aimed at Jewish 
people. I will take lectures from no one about the need for vigorous 
efforts to fight anti-Semitism on campus or anywhere else.
  I am also a deeply committed Zionist who firmly believes in Israel's 
right to exist as a homeland for the Jewish people. However, as someone 
who is also a longtime champion of protecting freedom of speech, I must 
oppose this misguided bill.
  While there is much in the bill I agree with, its core provision 
would put a thumb on the scale in favor of

[[Page H2792]]

one particular definition of anti-Semitism to the exclusion of all 
others, to be used when the Department of Education assesses claims of 
anti-Semitism on campus.
  This definition adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance 
Alliance, or IHRA, includes ``contemporary examples of anti-Semitism.'' 
The problem is that these examples may include protected speech in some 
contexts, particularly with respect to criticism of the State of 
Israel.
  To be clear, I vehemently disagree with the sentiments toward Israel 
expressed in those examples, and too often criticism of Israel does, in 
fact, take the form of virulent anti-Semitism.
  Many Jewish students no longer feel safe on campus, and some colleges 
have not done nearly enough to protect them. However, while this 
definition and its examples may have useful applications in certain 
contexts, by effectively codifying them into title VI, this bill 
threatens to chill constitutionally protected speech. Speech that is 
critical of Israel alone does not constitute unlawful discrimination. 
By encompassing purely political speech about Israel into title VI's 
ambit, the bill sweeps too broadly.
  As the ACLU notes, if this legislation were to become law, colleges 
and universities that want to avoid title VI investigations or the 
potential loss of Federal funding could end up suppressing protected 
speech that is criticizing Israel or supporting Palestinians.
  Moreover, it could result in students and faculty self-censoring 
their political speech. Even the IHRA definition's lead author, Kenneth 
Stern, opposes codifying the definition that he wrote, the IHRA 
definition, for this reason.
  Vigorous enforcement of the Federal civil rights law does not depend 
on defining terms like ``anti-Semitism'' or ``racism.'' In fact, 
codifying one definition of anti-Semitism to the exclusion of all other 
possible definitions could actually undermine Federal civil rights law 
because anti-Semitism, like other forms of bigotry, evolves over time, 
and future conduct that comes to be widely understood as anti-Semitic 
may no longer meet the statutory definition.
  Mr. Speaker, we cannot ignore the context in which this legislation 
is being rushed to the floor in a cynical attempt to exploit, for 
political gain, the deep divisions currently on display at college 
campuses across the country.
  Much of this activity, whether you agree with the sentiments 
expressed at these protests or not, constitutes legally protected 
speech and expression. Some participants, shamefully, have exhibited 
anti-Semitic conduct, and the Department of Education will rightfully 
investigate them, consulting the IHRA definition and other relevant 
definitions in the process. They do not need this legislation to help 
them with their inquiries.
  Some students have even crossed the line into vandalism, destruction 
of private property, and willful disruption of campus life. They too 
will face legal consequences, and nothing in this bill will affect 
that. There is no excuse for bigotry, threats, or violence directed at 
anyone, anywhere, and it is imperative that we confront the scourge of 
anti-Semitism. Congress can help, but this legislation is not the 
answer.
  Instead of engaging in political theatrics that do not do anything 
concrete to stop anti-Semitism on campus, we need to put our money 
where our mouth is. Last year, the Biden administration outlined a 
comprehensive national strategy to counter anti-Semitism, the 
cornerstone of which was increasing enforcement actions by the Office 
of Civil Rights at the Department of Education.
  President Biden's budget called for a 27 percent increase in funding 
for that office. If my Republican colleagues are serious about fighting 
anti-Semitism, they would have fully funded that request. Instead, they 
bragged about proposing to slash funding by 25 percent, funding to 
enforce the laws against anti-Semitism on campus. They bragged about 
proposing to slash funding by 25 percent and ultimately insisted that 
funding be kept flat despite the marked increase in anti-Semitism 
complaints. If my Republican colleagues are serious about anti-
Semitism, we would be considering legislation to codify the national 
strategy today instead of fiddling with definitions.
  If my Republican colleagues were serious about anti-Semitism, they 
would have spoken up after neo-Nazis in Charlottesville chanted: ``Jews 
will not replace us.''
  If my Republican colleagues were serious about anti-Semitism, they 
would have spoken up when President Trump declared that there were 
``very fine people on both sides'' of that rally.
  Additionally, just last week, former President Trump downplayed what 
happened in Charlottesville, calling it a ``peanut'' compared to recent 
campus protests of the Israel-Gaza war, and we heard crickets from the 
Republicans.
  We hear nothing from our Republican colleagues when some 
conservatives repeated anti-Semitic tropes about George Soros or 
others.
  I say to my Republican friends: For too long, your selective silence 
on these matters has been deafening. If you mean what you say here 
today and if you believe that the threats and vitriol that Jewish 
students face on college campuses is unjust and that combatting anti-
Semitism is more than a convenient talking point in your politically 
motivated crusade against institutions of higher education, then I 
beseech you: Please move beyond pointless gestures and posturing and 
actually help us protect Jewish students. Fully fund the 
administration's efforts to counter anti-Semitism and other forms of 
discrimination. Our Nation's students deserve no less.

  By contrast, this legislation threatens freedom of speech, one of our 
most cherished values, while doing nothing to combat anti-Semitism.
  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge Members to oppose the bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks 
to the Chair.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would suggest the gentleman turn on 
his television and watch what is going on right now.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Lawler), the author of this bill.
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, I respond to my colleague from New York and 
his misguided remarks.
  In 2018, the gentleman was a cosponsor of the Anti-Semitism Awareness 
Act, which adopted the very definition that he just objected to. As a 
cosponsor of H.R. 5924, the definition that would be adopted is: 
``Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews which may be expressed 
as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-
Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or 
their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious 
facilities.''
  He was a cosponsor of that bill.
  H.R. 6090, which I introduced, which has 59 cosponsors, adopts the 
IHRA working definition and its contemporary examples. The definition 
is: ``Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews which may be 
expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations 
of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals 
and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and 
religious facilities.''
  It is the same definition, and, yet, now, somehow he is opposed to 
it.
  Fundamentally, some of my colleagues on the left are allowing 
electoral politics to get in the way of doing what is right.

                              {time}  1330

  The gentleman from New York is a graduate of Columbia University, and 
yet couldn't muster the courage to take the subway north to stop by and 
call out the anti-Semitism that is running rampant at Columbia 
University. It is exactly why this bill is necessary today.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Antisemitism Awareness 
Act, and I thank my colleague, Congressman Josh Gottheimer from New 
Jersey, for his courage in leading on this issue.
  In every generation, the Jewish people have been scapegoated, 
harassed, evicted from their homeland, and murdered. Many of us 
remember the Holocaust as the most recent large-scale instance of this, 
but it was hardly the first in the Jewish people's long history of 
persecution.
  Prior to October 7, it may have seemed like we were making progress

[[Page H2793]]

in fighting anti-Semitism, especially in the United States. A prime 
example: Jewish students weren't afraid to attend classes on their 
college campuses.
  And yet today, we hear calls for intifada ring out on school grounds. 
We see Jewish students being physically prevented from going to class, 
rioters chanting ``death to Israel'' and ``death to America,'' and so 
much more.
  In the U.S., Jews account for only 2.4 percent of the population, and 
globally they make up 0.2 percent of the world's population. The Jewish 
people need our support now. They need action now. They need to know 
they have a place in our country now.
  They cannot fight anti-Semitism alone, and they shouldn't have to 
either.
  The Antisemitism Awareness Act requires the Department of Education 
to use the IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism and its 
contemporary examples when enforcing title VI violations of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964.
  Codifying a single definition of anti-Semitism will help the 
Department of Education and school administrators, who have been 
feckless, clearly identify instances of anti-Semitism and protect the 
safety of all students, including Jewish students.
  Now, some opponents may try to make the argument that this imposes 
restrictions on our constitutional right to free speech. It is not 
true.
  First of all, a constitutional protection is in the bill. It clearly 
states: ``Nothing in this act shall be construed to diminish or 
infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States.''
  Additionally, speech is already protected under the Civil Rights Act, 
but when the speech turns into harassment or other prohibited action 
and the action is motivated by anti-Semitism, that is when it becomes 
illegal conduct.
  Right now, without a clear definition of anti-Semitism, the 
Department of Education and college administrators are having trouble 
discerning whether conduct is anti-Semitic or not, whether the activity 
we are seeing crosses the line to anti-Semitic harassment.
  Other opponents to the bill say they would rather see a different 
bill tackling this.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from New York.
  Mr. LAWLER. That is no reason, and no ``political cover'' to vote 
against another helpful measure.
  I ask my colleagues who would prefer other solutions to consider the 
good it will do for the Jewish students and, yes, keep pushing for more 
change in the future. We need to hold these institutions accountable.
  My bill has bipartisan support: 59 cosponsors, dozens of Jewish 
advocacy groups, including the ADL, the AJC, and Agudath Israel. It is 
absurd to oppose this on the grounds that it somehow limits free 
speech.
  Calling for death to Jews is not protected speech. It is anti-
Semitic, and the fact that we have some of the highest-ranking Jewish 
officials in America refusing to defend the Jewish community because of 
politics is a disgrace, it is shameful, and it is pathetic.
  Anyone who votes against this bill because they would rather put 
political expediency and electoral politics ahead of anything else has 
no business being a Member of Congress.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from New York.
  Mr. LAWLER. Mr. Speaker, never again is now, and we must act. That is 
our responsibility.
  I would remind everyone, when you cosponsor a bill that accomplishes 
the same thing, nothing has changed, and yet now we need to backtrack 
all because of politics.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman's remarks are slanderous.
  First of all, the bill that I cosponsored 2 years ago was a different 
bill. It did not exclude--let me read from this bill: ``The use of 
alternative definitions of anti-Semitism impairs enforcement efforts by 
adding multiple standards and may fail to identify many of the modern 
manifestations of anti-Semitism.''
  That is nonsense, and it was not in the bill that was, I think, about 
7 or 8 years ago. The two bills are different.
  Second, I oppose this bill because it infringes on freedom of speech, 
and there are Jewish groups, such as Reconstructionist Judaism, J 
Street and T'ruah that oppose this bill for the same reason, and they 
are not anti-Semitic. There are Jewish groups that support the bill. 
There are Jewish groups that oppose the bill.
  I have been a supporter of Israel and of Zionism, and an opponent of 
anti-Semitism all my life. I have been active in Zionist organizations 
ever since I was in high school, and to say that anyone who votes 
against this bill is supporting anti-Semitism is a disgrace.
  There are differences of opinion that occur on this floor from time 
to time, honest differences. Someone who opposes this bill may think 
that it infringes on freedom of speech. Someone who opposes this bill 
may note that the author of the IHRA definition that this would 
enshrine in law said don't codify it. The author, Kenneth Stern, said 
this is a good working definition that may indicate anti-Semitism. So 
are the other two, but it should not be codified into law because that 
could make, depending on the circumstances, free speech illegal. The 
author of the IHRA definition said that.
  There may be legitimate differences of opinion between those who 
support this bill and those who oppose this bill, but to say that 
anyone who opposes this bill supports anti-Semitism is a disgraceful 
slander.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).
  Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of the Antisemitism Awareness 
Act.
  We all know that since Hamas' brutal and barbaric attack on Israel on 
October 7, 2023, we have seen an absolute explosion of anti-Semitic 
attacks and violence now, especially on our college and university 
campuses.
  There is no doubt that the free exchange of ideas is a crucial pillar 
of our freedom, but there is also no doubt that the conversations must 
be grounded in truth and respect for one another.
  Leadership at institutions of higher learning across our Nation have 
allowed these anti-Israel protests and anti-Semitic protests to descend 
into absolute chaos.
  Ultimately, they have failed to support Jewish students. Such hatred 
has no place in our society.
  Mr. Speaker, by clearly defining anti-Semitism, the Antisemitism 
Awareness Act will help the Department of Education better enforce 
Federal anti-discrimination laws.
  This bill will, for the first time, codify protection for Jewish 
students who are and have been subject to anti-Semitic harassment, 
intimidation, and violence. It is imperative that all students feel 
safe on their campuses.
  As such, I urge this body to pass this critical legislation and do 
what university leaders will not do and that is condemn these acts of 
hatred and support Jewish students across the country.
  I am proud to join my colleague, Mr. Lawler, in supporting this 
legislation, and I look forward to voting for it today.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan 
bill, the Antisemitism Awareness Act, to ensure that we are standing up 
to the Jew hatred that is spreading like wildfire on campuses across 
our country. I am proud to lead this legislation with my friend and 
fellow Problem Solvers Caucus member, Congressman Mike Lawler from New 
York.
  As we are voting today in real time, our country's universities are 
experiencing a tidal wave of anti-Semitism. Protesters have targeted 
Jewish students, haranguing them with awful Jew-hating insults and 
cheering on Hamas, a barbaric, foreign terrorist organization that 
murdered Americans on October 7 and still hold five living Americans 
hostage, including my constituent, Edan Alexander. I met with hostage 
families just this morning.

[[Page H2794]]

  I saw these protests up close, like many Americans did, at Columbia 
earlier this month. I have heard the sickening Jew-hating, anti-Semitic 
comments comparing Zionists to Nazis, promising a redux of October 7 a 
thousand times over, and calling for ``resistance by any means 
necessary'' and intifada revolution. Intifada is used to call for a 
violent uprising against Israel and Jewish people.
  These protests embolden Hamas, America's enemy and Iranian-backed 
terrorist. In fact, they have put out a statement lauding professors as 
the leaders of the future. That is what our enemies said about the pro-
Hamas protesters at these universities.
  Let me clear up any confusion since I am a huge champion myself of 
free speech. This bill protects the First Amendment. It allows 
criticism of Israel. I ensured that. It was critical to me. It doesn't 
allow calls for the destruction or elimination of the Jewish state, but 
it certainly allows criticism of Israel.
  Even more, it reminds us that our universities have a title VI 
obligation to stamp out harassment on the basis of race, color, or 
national origin.
  Mr. Speaker, we cannot stand idly by as protesters call for the death 
of Jews on college campuses and across the country. This bill will 
require the Department of Education to use the International Holocaust 
Remembrance Alliance or IHRA definition of anti-Semitism when carrying 
out title VI investigations.

  IHRA's anti-Semitism definition is the most widely recognized in the 
world. It is used by 36 countries. It condemns traditional hatred and 
the ugly, modern anti-Semitism that we are seeing on college campuses.
  There shouldn't be anything controversial about this bill. As was 
mentioned when it was first introduced in 2018, 50 Democrats and 
Republicans cosponsored this legislation, including Members who are 
still in this body.
  Right now, the Department of Education has 137 active title VI 
investigations, some of which have been open for years.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from New Jersey.
  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, the bill will give investigators a clear 
framework to evaluate anti-Semitism and finally hold harassers 
accountable.
  Don't just take my word for it. Thirty of our Nation's leading Jewish 
groups back this bill. Under the last three administrations, the State 
Department has used the IHRA definition to monitor anti-Semitism 
worldwide. This bill takes a commonsense step to formalize the IHRA 
definition for our education systems. Again, three administrations 
accepted this definition of anti-Semitism.
  When I was at Columbia University last week, I told the 
administrators that we need deeds, not words to protect Jewish 
students.
  Mr. Speaker, I am making the same ask of my colleagues. This bill is 
a critical step we can take to stand against hate. I hope my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle will join us in supporting this legislation 
and stand strong against anti-Semitism with no excuses, no claims of 
commas that they don't like. Standing strong today against hate and 
anti-Semitism is what our country should stand for.

                              {time}  1345

  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. Molinaro).
  Mr. MOLINARO. Mr. Speaker, I would never question those who oppose 
this legislation's beliefs, their ideology, their religious faith. I 
do, however, question the motive.
  We are in a moment of choosing, and there are not two legitimate 
sides to this issue. The erection of encampments on college campuses 
isn't an expression of speech, it is a direct threat to Jewish students 
on college campuses.
  Those who spew hate and ignorance and anti-Semitism in multiple 
horrid forms aren't simply expressing a constitutional right; it is an 
infringement on the rights of Jewish students. Those who conduct 
themselves in this way are wrong.
  They harass Jewish students who are innocently attempting simply to 
study. I know it and I have seen it firsthand, as I have visited 
students at Cornell and Binghamton in upstate New York. These students 
who think that they are simply extending their freedom of speech aren't 
understanding the hate, ignorance, and violence that is emboldened by 
it. They are wrong to feel entitled that they can simply occupy 
buildings and public spaces and damage public property. They are wrong.
  Congress should not only establish a firm commitment to the basic 
definition of anti-Semitism, but it ought to speak with clarity that 
this is wrong. Perhaps if we had said that decades ago, we wouldn't see 
the escalation that we are seeing today.
  Perhaps if college presidents simply accepted responsibility for the 
safety and security of their Jewish students, we wouldn't see the 
violence we have today, we wouldn't need law enforcement on college 
campuses to protect students. My God, we don't and should never need 
that kind of enforcement to protect the rights of innocent students: 
not in tents, not occupying buildings, not threatening hate, violence, 
or ignorance. We shouldn't need that kind of enforcement to ensure 
Jewish students can simply be Jewish students.
  For that reason, I not only support the bill, I encourage my 
colleagues to do the same. Speak with clarity.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, every bit of conduct that Mr. Molinaro described is 
loathsome, as he says, but that does not mean that we ought to pass a 
bill that threatens freedom of speech.
  This bill will do nothing to help stamp out anti-Semitism on campuses 
or anywhere else, but it will threaten free speech for the reasons I 
stated before.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my chairman, and I also found 
the remarks that were directed at you to be reprehensible. I know you 
and I know your commitment to fair play and the First Amendment.
  However, I have questions about this bill, and that is why I am here 
to listen to the debate. I don't know if Mr. Lawler wishes to respond, 
but there is another bill, Representative Manning and Representative 
Smith's bill. It is bipartisan. It has, I think, 15 Members of each 
party on it. I have been trying to get on it, but they are doing this 
crazy balancing act that eliminates certain people.
  I yield to Mr. Lawler to ask if he would support H.R. 7921 and work 
with Mr. Smith to get that brought to the floor.
  Mr. LAWLER. Sure. I think any legislation that we can bring forward 
to combat anti-Semitism is critical, and I think Ms. Manning and Mr. 
Smith have done a great job working to bring a piece of legislation 
forward. I have introduced a number. This is but one of them.
  I think the objective is to clearly define anti-Semitism and force 
accountability on these administrators and make sure the Department of 
Education has the teeth to enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time. I thank the gentleman. I 
appreciate his support for that, I think it is very important. I think 
it is a more inclusive bill, a broader bill. It takes in not just the 
problems at the universities but also takes on problems in the 
communities at large.
  There has been anti-Semitism for over 2,000 years. The Jews have a 
homeland. Before they had a homeland, they didn't have that sense of 
security anyplace where they were. It has been threatened so many times 
and so many places over the years, and it should not be taken from 
them.
  I was concerned, and Mr. Nadler made the point, that in 2017 in 
Charlottesville there were national socialist movements, Vanguard 
America groups, traditional workers parties, Klan members, all kind of 
rightwing anti-Semitic crowds, racist skinheads that were in 
Charlottesville. They marched around saying: ``Jews will not replace 
us.''
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Tennessee.
  Mr. COHEN. President Trump said there are good people on both sides.

[[Page H2795]]

Well, there are good people on both sides in Columbia, but there were 
not good people on both sides in Charlottesville.
  That anti-Semitism needs to be addressed and has not been addressed 
by my friends on the other side, although Mr. Smith has addressed it 
and there are others, so I don't want to paint a broad brush. There 
have been so many instances in history that have come not from these 
Palestinian supporters, but from skinheads, Neo-Nazis, and Klansmen, 
and that needs to be addressed. I think Mr. Smith's and Ms. Manning's 
bill addresses it. I hope that comes to the floor and we do a 
comprehensive attack on anti-Semitism.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. Smith).
  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I first thank Mr. Lawler for 
his very, very passionate and articulate defense of our Jewish 
brethren. It was very, very moving, and I thank him for that.
  Mr. Speaker, 42 years ago, my first human rights trip as a 
Congressman was to the Soviet Union to defend Jews against pernicious 
anti-Semitism. I never thought, however, that the anti-Semitic hate 
that I saw in Moscow and Leningrad could ever happen here, but it has. 
It is happening, and it is escalating.
  The bigotry, intolerance, prejudice, and unbridled hatred for Jews 
and the Nation of Israel exploding on American college campuses today 
is absolutely disgraceful. It is morally impermissible and illegal that 
Jewish students are the targets of anti-Semitic hate and violence.
  In both word and deed, Hamas is a terrorist organization that commits 
mass murder of Jews and seeks the evisceration of Israel. Don't believe 
it? Remember the horrific violence of October 7 and the ongoing ordeal 
of the hostages, or just read the Hamas Charter of 1988, the blueprint 
for genocide against Jews, a modern-day Nazi-like final solution.
  As co-chair of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating 
Antisemitism, I thank my good friends and colleagues, Mike Lawler and 
Josh Gottheimer, for authoring the Antisemitism Awareness Act.
  This important legislation will codify the IHRA working definition of 
anti-Semitism into title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the 
landmark antidiscrimination law. Schools that receive Federal funds 
must comply with title VI, and this bill will clarify that the Hamas 
hatred infecting our campuses must be dealt with as anti-Semitic 
discrimination that violates civil rights.
  Special thanks, Mr. Speaker, to the police, who at great risk to 
their own personal safety are trying to mitigate the threats to Jewish 
students.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Again, anti-Semitism is a terrible thing. Hamas is a genocidal 
organization which wants to kill all Jews, not just the State of 
Israel. There is no question about that. There is no question we have 
to fight anti-Semitism. There is no question the Manning bill is a good 
step in that direction. There is no question we ought to give the 
Office for Civil Rights the 25 percent increase the President has 
requested to enforce title VI on college campuses where there has been 
no question there has been vile anti-Semitism.
  That, however, does not mean we should pass this bill. This bill 
enshrines the IHRA definition, and I would remind you that the IHRA 
definition's chief author, Kenneth Stern said: Don't codify it in law 
because if codified into law, it would be destructive of free speech. 
The author of the IHRA definition said that.
  The bill also specifically excludes the Jerusalem and Nexus 
definitions. There is no good reason for that. All three definitions 
give examples of things that may be seen as anti-Semitism, that may 
indicate anti-Semitism. None of them should be codified into law, as 
this bill would do for one of them.
  I don't know why one and not the other two, but this bill would 
enshrine one of them into law against the will of its own author, who 
said this is my best definition, but don't enshrine it into law, or, 
rather, don't codify it into law because if it is made law, it could 
infringe free expression, and that is why not only the ACLU, but J 
Street, T'ruah, the Reconstructionist Jewish Movement, and a dozen 
other Jewish groups oppose this law, not because they support anti-
Semitism--they obviously don't--but because they both oppose anti-
Semitism and support freedom of speech, and those of us who oppose 
anti-Semitism and support freedom of speech ought to vote ``no'' on 
this bill.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the chairman of the Education and the 
Workforce Committee of the House.
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, America's colleges and universities are 
experiencing an explosion in anti-Semitism, including explicit support 
for terrorism. That these taxpayer-funded institutions have become 
forums for promoting terrorism is unacceptable.
  Campus life has become a daily trial of intimidation and harassment 
for America's Jewish students. Two months ago, nine brave Jewish 
students described for the Education Committee how their schools have 
become hostile environments that include death threats and physical 
attacks.
  At numerous schools, unlawful encampments now disrupt learning and 
endanger students. At Columbia, a campus rabbi warned Jewish students 
to leave campus. A Jewish Yale student was stabbed in the eye. The 
Antisemitism Awareness Act would provide a needed tool to help better 
determine anti-Semitic intent, which in turn would help ensure the 
safety of Jewish students.
  I commend Representative Lawler for this bipartisan, bicameral bill, 
and I urge its passage.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. Jordan), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
  Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Calls 
for the destruction of Israel, our dearest and closest ally, are wrong. 
Attacks on Jewish students on college campuses are wrong, as well. I 
thank Representative Lawler and Representative Gottheimer for this fine 
piece of legislation, and I thank the chairman of the Immigration 
Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee of the Judiciary 
Committee.

  The only way you stop this is to take action, and the Judiciary 
Committee started that yesterday. We sent a letter both to Secretary 
Blinken and Secretary Mayorkas asking three simple questions: Are the 
students, are the people engaged in this activity, this wrong activity, 
this radical activity on campuses against Jewish students, are they 
here on a visa? If they are, is the State Department taking actions to 
revoke that visa? If the State Department is taking those actions, is 
the Department of Homeland Security looking to remove these 
individuals?
  Pretty basic questions, pretty important questions I think the 
Congress has the right to know about and the American people have a 
right to know about if we are ever going to stop the egregious activity 
going on. In order to stop it, you have to take action.
  We are a legislative body. We have a piece of legislation that begins 
that process. Let's pass this legislation, and then let's do the 
oversight to get the answers to those questions so the bad guys doing 
this stuff on college campuses can't do it on a visa.
  Remember, at Columbia, 55 percent of the student body is here on a 
visa.
  Maybe the American people have a right to know the answers to those 
three questions. We posed them yesterday to Secretary Mayorkas and 
Secretary Blinken. Let's hope we get an answer soon. Let's hope the 
Biden administration steps up and starts taking action to stop what is 
going on.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Carter).
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act.
  The pro-Hamas protests we are seeing now play out on TV that are 
taking place on college campuses are living proof of what happens when 
we tolerate hate and ignorance.
  I recently spoke with the aunt of a 4-year-old girl who saw her 
parents and siblings murdered on October 7 by Hamas, and she was held 
hostage for 51 days, a 4-year-old held hostage after

[[Page H2796]]

seeing her parents killed in front of her.
  That is the behavior that anti-Semitic college students are 
tolerating? It is disgusting, and it is criminal. They are learning it 
from those at the very top. We had a hearing not too long ago where 
college presidents refused to state that calling for the genocide of 
Jews was against their code of conduct.
  Jewish students should feel safe on campus and deserve to be treated 
with dignity and respect. All students do. The Department of Education 
needs to use every tool at its disposal to provide Jewish students with 
a safe environment to learn.
  Our laws should clearly reflect that discrimination includes the 
indisputable anti-Semitic rhetoric calling for violence against Jews. 
There are far too many inexcusable examples from this year alone, and 
this must stop. It cannot go on.

                              {time}  1400

  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. Mann).
  Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, the events unfolding at our country's colleges and 
universities are devastating. For years, we have taught Americans and 
committed ourselves to ``never again.'' Yet, we are watching the rot of 
anti-Semitism stain our American colleges and universities. We must 
reject the spoil of anti-Semitism and adopt a clear definition of what 
anti-Semitism is to better position college administrators and 
officials to respond to the terror these so-called protesters are 
bringing to Jewish students.
  Many of these are not pro-Palestinian protests. They are ill-informed 
mobs who believe that Hamas, a terrorist organization, is somehow good 
for the people of Gaza. That couldn't be further from the truth. Hamas 
continues to use innocent lives as human shields and intentionally 
positions civilians in the middle of combat zones while using their 
tunnels to protect their own military leaders and fighters.
  Is this what our Nation's students want to support?
  To my colleagues across the aisle who have chosen to praise these 
anti-Semitism protests, is that what you stand for?
  School administrators cannot straddle both sides of the fence here. 
We would not tolerate this sort of behavior toward any other group of 
students, and we must not start when the target is again on America's 
Jewish students.
  All students deserve a safe learning environment, and by adopting 
this definition of anti-Semitism, our college campuses are more 
empowered to uphold and protect safe environments for Jewish students.
  Congress must be clear. America stands with Israel, and we stand with 
Jewish students across every college campus in America.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to stand with Jewish 
students and vote in favor of this legislation.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support meaningful action to combat anti-
Semitism. Unfortunately, that is not the legislation before us. We risk 
threatening freedom of speech while providing no new tools that the 
Department of Education does not already have to investigate claims of 
anti-Semitism.
  The White House has developed a strong blueprint for countering anti-
Semitism, and there is already legislation to implement these policies. 
We should be working together to pass that legislation and to provide 
our civil rights enforcement agencies with the resources they need to 
address anti-Semitism wherever it occurs.
  This legislation is a distraction from the important work ahead of us 
to protect our students and all those who face discrimination. Not only 
is it a distraction, but it also threatens freedom of speech.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose it, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, you cannot fight anti-Semitism if you cannot define it. 
The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance offers us a clear and 
widely accepted definition rooted in the tragedy of the ages. After 
that horrific crime against humanity, the civilized nations of the 
world took a sacred oath: Never again.
  To support that oath, these united nations restored the Jewish state 
to its historic homelands. That state is now under attack at home and 
abroad, and with this act, America stands with our Jewish brethren at 
home and abroad.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 6090--
Antisemitism Awareness Act of 2023.
  In light of recent events across the globe and here in the United 
States, where anti-Semitic attacks and hate crimes have risen, this 
bipartisan bill is an attempt to codify the definition of 
``antisemitism''
  Specifically, this bill would require the Department of Education to 
take the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition 
of antisemitism into account when determining if an action or practice 
that violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was motivated by 
antisemitic intent.
  The IHRA defines antisemitism as the following:
  ``Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be 
expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations 
of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals 
and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and 
religious facilities.''
  In its list of examples of anti-Semitic conduct, the IHRA includes 
``[d]enying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., 
by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist 
endeavor,'' and ``[d]rawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy 
to that of the Nazis.''
  While there is both support and opposition for this bill it is 
important to highlight the issues and concerns.
  Namely, there is a concern that this bill will undermine free speech 
by codifying a singular definition of antisemitism.
  Notably, however, the bill language provides a provision to 
explicitly protect against infringement of the First Amendment.
  Additionally, while the Department of Education already utilizes this 
definition of ``antisemitism'' in its enforcement of Title VI civil 
rights claims, there is a concern that forcing the Department of 
Education to ``consider'' a particular definition of antisemitism does 
nothing to protect houses of worship, check antisemitic threats, or 
otherwise keep students safe on campus.
  Rather, improving civil rights enforcement should be the real key to 
fighting antisemitism.
  In May 2023, the Biden Administration created a ``U.S. National 
Strategy to Counter Antisemitism,'' a cornerstone of which is 
increasing enforcement actions by the Department of Education's Office 
for Civil Rights (OCR).
  Since the October 7 attacks on Israel, OCR has seen a dramatic rise 
in discrimination claims.
  President Biden's budget called for a 27 percent increase in funding 
to OCR, but funding remained level for FY 2024.
  Last year, House Republicans pushed to cut funds for federal civil 
rights enforcement on college campuses by 25 percent.
  Ultimately, however, House Republicans refused to increase OCR's 
funding.
  Instead, they have fought adequately funding OCR to meet the surge in 
antisemitism complaints because, in the political hierarchy governing 
their culture war priorities, undermining LGBTQ civil rights is more 
important than protecting Jewish students from discrimination.
  I think we can all agree that the recent rise in antisemitism in the 
U.S. is a real problem, yet sadly House Republicans mostly ignored it.
  Thus, it is important to highlight that any support for this bill 
should also include corresponding support for the agency tasked with 
investigating claims of harassment and hate.
  Supporting such a measure while stripping away the tools to 
effectively carry out its duties is short-sided.
  In particularly, as we celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month this 
May, I must reiterate my condemnation to the rise of antisemitism--and 
call on my fellow elected officials,

[[Page H2797]]

faith leaders, and civil society leaders to continue to condemn and 
combat antisemitism, and to identify and educate others on the 
contributions of the Jewish American community.
  And so, as we celebrate the Jewish American community's contributions 
this month, we too must honor their resilience in the face of a long 
and painful history of persecution.
  Indeed, as stated by President Biden in his Proclamation on Jewish 
American Heritage Month, 2024--we must all ``remember that the power 
lies within each of us to rise together against hate, to see each other 
as fellow human beings, and to ensure that the Jewish community is 
afforded the safety, security, and dignity they deserve as they 
continue to shine their light in America and around the world.''
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address my intended vote on H.R. 
6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act.
  This bill would require the Department of Education to utilize the 
International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of 
antisemitism when interpreting whether an action or practice violates 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
  To be clear: I condemn antisemitism in all its forms and stand with 
the Jewish community as they mourn the losses sustained in the October 
7 terrorist attack by Hamas and the subsequent increase in antisemitic 
incidents in the U.S. and around the world.
  But requiring the Department of Education to use the IHRA definition 
would stifle free speech and curtail legitimate criticisms of the 
Israeli government's actions.
  I concur with J Street, which noted: ``On its own, the IHRA Working 
Definition, coupled with its contemporary examples, is broad and can 
label legitimate political speech and critique of Israel as inherently 
antisemitic. We are concerned that this concerted campaign to require 
the use of the IHRA definition and its examples by law and regulation 
creates significant opportunities for abuse and politicization, 
including by future MAGA-aligned administrations.''
  This bill violates First Amendment rights to share and debate ideas 
and express peaceful dissent. It is too broad and could lead to 
colleges and universities banning student groups that aim to provide 
safe refuge, community, and space to discuss issues that are important 
to them based on the opinion or statement of one student.
  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, while I was unable to attend today's vote 
series, had I been able to attend, I would have proudly voted yes on 
H.R. 6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which I am a cosponsor of. 
This legislation is an important step to protecting the American Jewish 
community, particularly in light of the alarming rise in antisemitic 
incidents across the country. The State Department has used the 
International Holocaust Remembrance. Alliance (IHRA) Definition since 
2010, while the Department of Education has considered the IHRA 
definition of antisemitism since 2019 when reviewing, investigating, or 
deciding whether there has been a violation of Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964. This legislation would make the IHRA definition the 
official policy of federal agencies, and I urge Congress to swiftly 
pass it.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Meuser). All time for debate has 
expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 1173, the previous question is ordered 
on the bill.
  Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further consideration of H.R. 
6090 is postponed.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from California 
(Mr. Kiley) for 30 minutes.
  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to present a resolution that I am 
introducing in this House and that I hope will receive prompt passage 
and bipartisan support.
  The resolution reads as follows:
  Whereas, in recent weeks, tent encampments have spread at 
universities across the country. These encampments are illegal and in 
violation of university policies.
  They have become rife with anti-Semitic threats and acts of violence, 
harassment, and other disruptive behavior.
  Some universities have responded by evenhandedly enforcing the law 
and clearing the encampments. They have emphasized the rights of 
students to protest and express their opinions in innumerable ways 
while making it clear that acts in violation of the law or university 
rules will not be tolerated.
  Other universities have decided to ignore the law and ignore their 
own policies, allowing encampments and other illegal activity 
associated with them to grow unchecked for weeks.
  Encampments have made demands of universities such as divesting from 
companies tied to Israel, cutting ties with Hillel campus programs, and 
ending study abroad programs to Israel.
  Some of these universities have even negotiated with those in the 
encampments and agreed to their demands around changes in university 
policy, including Northwestern University, UC Riverside, Brown, 
Rutgers, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Minnesota.
  Still, others have canceled classes, moved to online meetings, or 
canceled graduation ceremonies, and that includes Columbia, UCLA, UC 
San Diego, and Emory University.
  These encampments and the criminal behavior connected to them, such 
as threats or acts of violence, blocking or occupying buildings, 
genuine harassment, or other disruptive behavior, are not protected by 
the First Amendment.
  To the contrary, they disrupt the operation of the university and the 
academic freedom and speech rights of other students.
  Free speech on campus means universities should encourage free and 
open expression in speech, writing, listening, challenging, and 
learning while never shielding students from ideas the university 
disagrees with or limiting expression on the basis of content.
  It does not mean universities should tolerate the promotion of 
violence, the destruction of property, the obstruction of students' 
freedom of movement, harassment, vandalism, or other unlawful acts.
  Resolved, the House finds canceling classes and commencement in 
response to unlawful encampments is unacceptable and unfair to the 
majority of students.
  The House condemns any negotiation where a university changes its 
policy in response to the demands of those engaged in unlawful activity 
on campus.
  The House condemns any concessions made by universities based on 
demands from those participating in unlawful encampments, including 
ending study abroad programs to Israel, cutting ties with Hillel, and 
divesting from companies associated with Israel.
  The House calls on universities across the country to work with local 
law enforcement to immediately clear tent encampments from university 
property and restore safe learning environments on their campuses, and 
further resolves that noncompliant students, faculty, or staff be 
subject to appropriate consequences.
  Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that we can come together and pass this 
resolution, and it can set the right tone for universities across the 
country because by this point, it is clear as day that the wrong 
approach is to allow illegal encampments to exist on campus and then to 
keep growing, growing, and growing as we have seen at UCLA, at USC, and 
at Columbia. That only

[[Page H2932]]

makes the problem more unmanageable. It only causes things to spiral 
out of control.
  The universities that have taken the right approach have said you, as 
a student, are fully protected under the First Amendment to express 
yourself on any topic with any opinion you would like in countless 
different ways.
  You are free to do that on our campus, but what you are not free to 
do is to set up structures on campus, to impede other students, or to 
engage in threats or acts of violence and other unlawful disruptive 
conduct that we have been seeing on these campuses.
  I am hoping that this resolution will point in the right direction 
those universities who have been approaching this problem in the wrong 
way to the detriment of their students.
  Now, perhaps the only thing more disgraceful than these illegal pro-
Hamas encampments is the way that these universities have catered to 
them.
  Perhaps even more disgraceful than that is the way that some 
politicians have, the way that some political leaders have remained 
silent or have refused to condemn things that are so morally clear or 
have equivocated on the clearest of moral questions.
  While President Biden did come out and make a strong statement today, 
up to this point, his response has been manifestly inadequate.
  The Governor of my State, Governor Newsom, in California, has had 
next to nothing to say about it, even though some of the worst 
situations are on California campuses.
  Just today, the Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, testified 
before our committee, the Education and the Workforce Committee.
  Now, Mr. Cardona came into this hearing with a troubling record. For 
example, he recently refused to say whether chants of ``From the River 
to the Sea'' are anti-Semitic.
  At today's hearing, I asked him some basic questions. I asked him if 
he would condemn the illegal tent encampments on university campuses. 
Secretary Cardona refused to do so.

  I asked him if he would condemn faculty members who interfere with 
the attempts of law enforcement to clear out these encampments and 
enforce the law. Secretary Cardona refused to condemn them.
  I asked him if he would condemn calls to divest from Israel. 
Secretary Cardona refused to do so. Perhaps most incredibly, I asked 
the Secretary several times, Secretary Cardona: Will you condemn calls 
for universities to cut ties with Hillel? As, for example, the 
organization Students for Justice in Palestine recently did at UC Santa 
Cruz.
  I asked him again and again: Secretary Cardona, will you condemn 
calls to cut ties with Hillel? And Secretary Cardona refused to do so.
  Why is this so hard? Hillel is a center for Jewish community and 
campus life on campuses all across the country.
  Secretary Cardona is unwilling to condemn those who say universities 
should cut ties with these organizations? Secretary Cardona is 
unwilling to condemn these overtly anti-Semitic statements?
  Given what the President said today, if we are to take seriously his 
statements condemning what is happening on our university campuses, we 
need to ask the question whether we can take that commitment seriously 
so long as Miguel Cardona remains his Secretary of Education.


                    Funding Cuts for Charter Schools

  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this 
administration's proposal to cut funding for the charter school 
program.
  This is an incredibly important program for many charter schools 
across the country in allowing them to start up and offer an option to 
students in communities across the United States.
  Now, prior to this year, this administration's support for charter 
schools has been tepid at best. Funding for the charter school program 
has remained flat as funding for various other parts of the education 
budget has increased substantially.
  Yet, this year, the administration went a step further. Its proposed 
budget for the Department of Education proposes a $40 million cut to 
the charter school program from $440 million to $400 million.
  Now, Secretary Cardona was asked about this at today's hearing, and 
he explained: Well, the Fiscal Responsibility Act requires us to make 
budget cuts--so he decided to go after charter schools.
  Mr. Speaker, that makes no sense whatsoever. The Department is asking 
for a significant increase in its budget this year, a $3.7 billion 
increase, so that its overall discretionary budget is $82.5 billion.
  They are asking for a $3.7 billion funding increase while cutting 
funding for the charter school program by $40 million.
  Mr. Speaker, I am in strong opposition to these cuts. I hope that 
this House will push back on them in a bipartisan manner because the 
reality is that charter schools across the country have made tremendous 
progress in closing achievement gaps and expanding the options that are 
available to parents.
  In fact, a recent study out of Stanford validated the work that 
charter schools have done and the results that they have gotten in 
closing achievement gaps that have persisted in other parts of our 
public education system.
  The reality is that there are far too many communities in this 
country, particularly in my State of California, where schools simply 
are not getting the job done. There are communities where the 
neighborhood school--that young people, that kids are assigned to--does 
not teach them to the read in the way that it should, does not teach 
them math in the way that it should, leaving them ill prepared for 
success in life.
  In many of these communities you have charters like Kipp Academy and 
many others that have started up and have done things differently. 
These are charters that have had high expectations, that have made 
significant gains, that have gotten kids reading above grade level and 
outperforming their peers at other schools in math. These charters are 
putting them on a path of future opportunity and success in life, but 
that is exactly what this proposal from this administration is going to 
cut funding for.
  It should also be noted that even in communities that have good 
public schools--like in my district, we have a number of truly 
outstanding traditional public schools--charter schools are still of 
value.
  We have a number of terrific charter schools as well, and they might 
be right for some families but not for others.
  The entire point is that not every student is the same, not every 
family is the same. By allowing a variety of options, some of which 
might have different focuses or a different approach to pedagogy or 
options that might offer immersion education or a focus on career 
technical education, this empowers parents to make the choice that is 
right for their child and their family.
  I find it completely unacceptable that this administration is 
withdrawing support for charter schools.
  I also find it unacceptable that my State of California has taken a 
number of steps in recent years to make it more difficult to start up, 
to operate, and to renew charter schools.
  What we need to do is look to the success that many charters have had 
and to draw lessons that we can then use to improve public education 
across this country so that every child in America has access to a 
quality education as they deserve.


                  OPPOSING THE INCREASE IN THE GAS TAX

  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to a forthcoming 
increase in the gas tax in California. It almost defies belief, but 
California's gas tax is about to increase yet again, reaching $0.60 per 
gallon.
  Now, the State already has the highest gas tax in the country and by 
far the highest gas prices. As of today, Californians pay $1.70 more 
per gallon for gas than the national average and $0.53 more per gallon 
than the next closest State.

  I will say that again: We pay $0.53 more per gallon than the State 
with the second-highest gas prices. Even if you were actually to 
eliminate the entire gas tax in California, $0.60 per gallon, we would 
still have the second-highest gas prices in the entire country.
  I am calling on Governor Newsom and the legislature to act to make 
sure that this gas tax increase does not go into effect.
  Californians are already suffering under inflation and the price of 
groceries and the price of electricity as

[[Page H2933]]

well, which is the second highest of any State in the country. The last 
thing they need is another increase to the gas tax.
  I am calling on State lawmakers to stop this gas tax increase. As a 
matter of fact, what they should really do is suspend the gas tax 
entirely.
  It wouldn't bring prices down to a reasonable level, but it would 
provide folks throughout our State with relief that they very much 
need.

                Recognizing Sergeant Major Douglas Power

  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to now recognize a few 
outstanding individuals and organizations within my district.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize retiring Sergeant Major Douglas 
Power for his distinguished service with the United States Marine 
Corps, most recently as the government and external affairs officer for 
the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center in Bridgeport, 
California.
  Doug entered the Marine Corps Reserve in August 1980 and went on to 
graduate from boot camp and transfer to Active Duty in 1985.
  After first transferring overseas in 1987, his deployments to various 
locations, including Korea, Kuwait, and Iraq, underscored his 
commitment to defending our country.
  Throughout his more than three decades of military service, Sergeant 
Major Power displayed an unwavering dedication to service and 
leadership.
  Deservingly, he was awarded multiple decorations and medals, 
demonstrating the legacy of honor and sacrifice that he established.
  He retired from military service in 2012, at which time he began his 
new career as the government and external affairs officer at the 
training center.
  After 12 years of faithful dedication to civic service and community 
engagement, he retired from that role this year, on April 30, 2024.
  I am proud to represent outstanding servicemembers like Sergeant 
Major Power in Congress. I thank him for his service to our district 
and our country.
  Therefore, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I 
am honored to recognize Sergeant Major Douglas Power for his heroic and 
valuable service to our country and community, and I wish him the best 
in his retirement.


                        Recognizing Stacey Simon

  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize retiring County Counsel 
Stacey Simon for her 25 years of service to Mono County.
  Stacey has served the people of Mono County for more than two 
decades, most recently as county counsel, and never wavered from her 
goal of making the county a better place.
  Throughout Stacey's tenure, she not only skillfully handled the 
routine business of the county but also guided Mono through various 
complex problems and challenges, including the uncertainties of COVID-
19.
  Additionally, she played an instrumental role in many local projects, 
most notably the construction of the Lee Vining Community Center and 
preschool program, the county's solid waste franchise system, 
implementation of HIPAA, housing developments, and much more.
  Mr. Speaker, it looks like we had an issue with our graphic, so I am 
going to start over.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish to recognize retiring County Counsel Stacey Simon 
for her 25 years of service to Mono County.
  Stacey has served the people of Mono County for more than two

                   Recognizing Alpine Watershed Group

  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to recognize 
the Alpine Watershed Group for receiving the 2022 Forest Service 
Volunteers Program Citizen Stewardship and Partnerships Award.
  The Alpine Watershed Group is a community-based nonprofit 
organization in my district that is dedicated to conducting essential 
water quality monitoring, habitat restoration, and education programs 
throughout Alpine County.
  Over the span of more than two decades, the Alpine Watershed Group 
has been an instrumental partner to the Humboldt-Toiyabe National 
Forest and the United States Forest Service.
  In 2022 alone, the Alpine Watershed Group planned and recruited for 
multiple volunteer events in the forest, including large watershed and 
forest restoration projects, trash and roadside cleanups, tree 
planting, and watershed monitoring.
  Due to the help of their volunteers at the annual Creek Day event, 72 
bags of trash were removed, amounting to more than 500 pounds; 25 bags 
of invasive weeds were removed; 102 willow stakes were installed; 600 
feet of fence in Hope Valley were removed; and a beaver dam analogue in 
Faith Valley was constructed.
  In addition to these efforts, the group provides continual outreach 
and environmental education programs that support the United States 
Forest Service's mission to care for the land and serve the people. 
Their devoted efforts have made an indelible impact on our national 
forests, local watersheds, and the Alpine County community.
  Therefore, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I 
am honored to recognize the Alpine Watershed Group for this outstanding 
accomplishment and commend them for their significant contributions and 
dedication to promoting the sustainability of our Nation's natural 
resources.


     Celebrating Soroptimist International of Loomis Basin's 50th 
                              Anniversary

  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I wish to mark and celebrate the 50-year 
anniversary of the Soroptimist International of Loomis Basin club.
  Over the span of five decades, they have made a significant 
contribution in the Loomis community and Sacramento region by investing 
in the development of women of all ages and fostering a passion to make 
both our local and international communities a better place.
  The Loomis chapter of Soroptimist International was founded 1974 with 
the mission to provide women and girls with the access to education and 
training they need to achieve economic empowerment.
  In addition to hosting and participating in many local events, they 
provide scholarships and grants for women to improve their economic 
status while honing valuable skills to further their education and help 
with employment opportunities.
  Their dedicated efforts have made a meaningful difference in the 
lives of women and girls, and it is an honor to represent exemplary 
organizations like the Soroptimist International of Loomis Basin here 
in Congress.
  Therefore, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I 
am honored to recognize the Loomis Basin Soroptimists and their 50 
years of dedication to the women of our community.

  Mr. WELCH. Madam President, May 11 will mark the second anniversary 
of the fatal shooting of a Palestinian American and accomplished Al 
Jazeera journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh. She was shot in the head while 
reporting on an Israeli raid in the Jenin refugee camp in the West 
Bank. At the time of her death, she was wearing a bulletproof vest with 
``PRESS'' written in large letters on the front and on the back.
  While there had been some earlier exchanges of gunfire between 
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants, there is no credible 
evidence that has been produced that the shooter acted in legitimate 
self-defense. No one in Shireen's immediate vicinity was armed, and no 
shots were fired from her location. Another journalist near her was 
also shot, but he survived.
  Shortly after Shireen's death, Secretary of State Antony Blinken 
rightly called for a credible, thorough investigation and that the 
individuals responsible should be held accountable.
  Israeli officials first denied responsibility. But when it became 
clear where the shots were fired from, they called Shireen's death an 
unintentional, tragic mistake. The shooter reportedly fired from an 
armored vehicle that was 190 meters away.
  The inescapable conclusion is that she was intentionally targeted. 
The question is: Why?
  My predecessor, Senator Patrick Leahy, asked detailed questions about 
her case, including why the Leahy law was not applied to stop U.S. 
assistance to the unit--the particular unit--responsible for Shireen's 
death. His questions were never answered. Since then, there has been no 
credible investigation.
  I am disappointed that Israeli authorities have failed to fully 
cooperate with U.S. efforts to determine what happened, and nobody has 
been held accountable.
  Shireen Abu Akleh's case has become one of many unresolved shootings 
in the West Bank and Gaza. Since the Hamas attack--the terrible attack 
on October 7--more than 140 journalists have reportedly been killed in 
Gaza. None of those cases have been investigated, and no one has been 
held accountable.
  We have not and we will not forget Shireen Abu Akleh. She was an 
American citizen. More importantly, she was an innocent civilian doing 
her job, which she paid for with her life. She, her family, and her 
colleagues in the press deserve justice.
  On May 3, World Press Freedom Day, Secretary Blinken said:

       In their pursuit of truth, journalists often face 
     unprecedented danger worldwide. On World Press Freedom Day, 
     we recognize their bravery, resilience, and vital role in 
     ensuring the free flow of accurate information. Our support 
     for journalists and an independent media is unwavering.

  My hope is that Secretary Blinken uses his influence and insists on 
the credible, thorough investigation of the killing of Shireen Abu 
Akleh that he called for 2 years ago and that those responsible be 
brought to justice.
  I yield the floor.

                             Anti-Semitism

  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, October 7, 2023, was almost 5 years to 
the day after the attack on the Tree of Life synagogue--almost 5 years 
to the day. Anti-Semitism has been on the rise around the world and 
unfortunately here in America. We are seeing it on college campuses. We 
are seeing it in conversations online. It is not new, it is old, but it 
is on the rise in a way that we have not seen in a long time in the 
United States.
  In 2019, Senator Rosen and I launched the Senate Bipartisan Task 
Force for Combatting Anti-Semitism. We started that on the 1-year 
anniversary of the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue. Our mission 
was pretty simple: We wanted to create a task force to be able to 
collaborate with law enforcement, Federal Agencies, State and local 
governments, educators, advocates, clergy--any stakeholders who wanted 
to be able to combat anti-Semitism with education, empowerment, and 
bringing communities together in conversation.
  Our goal was to speak out with one voice about hate, to support 
legislative efforts to combat anti-Semitism, to promote Holocaust 
education, and to bring the issue of combatting anti-Semitism to the 
forefront of our national conversation and, quite frankly, 
international.
  She and I have worked together to be able to contact other nations 
and their Parliaments on what we have seen as anti-Semitism in other 
countries, to be able to reach out to Ambassadors, but to also speak 
out on what we see here in the United States. That has not changed.
  The State Department has offered this warning:

       History has shown that wherever anti-Semitism has gone 
     unchecked, the persecution of others has been present or not 
     far behind. Defeating anti-Semitism must be a cause of great 
     importance not only for Jews, but for all people who value 
     humanity and justice.

  That is our own State Department.
  So now what are we going do about what we are seeing on college 
campuses? Interestingly enough, people see this as a new thing just in 
the last 7 months. This has been on the rise on college campuses for 
quite a while. Many of us have been ringing that bell to say that there 
is something happening in the national conversation on our college 
campuses.
  So let's find ways to be able to engage on this. Senator Rosen and I 
have a piece of legislation that is a compilation of multiple pieces 
that we have worked on for a very long time to be able to talk about 
anti-Semitism and to say there are specific ways that our Nation can 
get involved with this.
  I have affirmed President Biden in areas where we agree, and there 
are some areas that he has brought up in the task force that he has 
created on the executive level to take on anti-Semitism nationally. 
Some of those things have been actually executed and carried out, and 
some of them have not.
  So we have continued to be able to nudge in ways that we thought were 
appropriate to be able to nudge and to be able to poke to say things 
can be done. It has been leadership at our State Department that has 
risen up on that, and some, we have been actively involved in trying to 
be able to get into those positions, to be able to lead.
  My friend Tim Scott came to the floor to be able to ask for unanimous 
consent to be able to pass his resolution to condemn anti-Semitism on 
college campuses. I want to thank my friend Tim Scott for his 
leadership on this issue and what he has also done to be able to raise 
awareness. But unfortunately his request to be able to pass that 
resolution was denied.
  We should be able to find common ground on issues that condemn hate. 
His resolution was a simple statement: What are we going to do as a 
body to be able to condemn hatred in this area? We should not ignore 
this.
  The House of Representatives last week brought up the Anti-Semitism 
Awareness Act. It was a bipartisan piece of legislation that they 
passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives that they have 
now sent to this body to be able to take up and to debate and to 
discuss.
  What has been interesting to me is, when they picked up the Anti-
Semitism Awareness Act as a nonpartisan piece of legislation, this is a 
continuance of actually what happened under the Trump administration. 
President Trump used the same definitions and the same process of 
putting it in the Department of Education, using what is called the 
IHRA definition for ``anti-Semitism'' and the examples attached to it 
in Executive order 13899.
  But what has been fascinating to me is, when the House of 
Representatives passed it, there was a whole group of folks and some 
folks from my own party who stepped up and said: No, we can't actually 
do this, because this would inhibit free speech.
  I have smiled at those same folks and said: Did you say that when 
President Trump was actually using it as an Executive order under his 
administration? Because now they are talking about making a statutory, 
long-term change.
  The IHRA definition is not new, by the way. The United States has 
been a party to this definition since the 1990s. The International 
Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition--that is IHRA--has been 
recognized all over the world as a basic definition with examples of 
what anti-Semitism is.
  It is not new to the United States. There are many athletic teams 
that

[[Page S3587]]

have recognized the IHRA definition for their teams in their 
conversations to be able to recognize what anti-Semitism is. There are 
34 States, including my own State of Oklahoma, that have recognized the 
IHRA definition within our own States to say: This is how we are going 
to define ``anti-Semitism'' in our States.
  This is a very basic principle. It is difficult to discourage what 
you cannot even define, and when someone makes just a blanket statement 
for anti-Semitism, it is helpful to put some definition to what it 
actually means and what it does not mean. For instance, if someone were 
to say they disagree with the Netanyahu government, is that anti-
Semitic? The IHRA definition would say, clearly, it is not. We can 
disagree on governmental action. That is a normal part of dialogue.
  It also is not something that inhibits free speech. Even hateful 
speech in the United States--even foolish, even stupid speech--can be 
said in the United States. It is a protected right to be able to say 
whatever crazy thing you want to be able to say in the United States, 
but when it shifts from free speech to inciting violence and threats, 
that has shifted. That has moved from just speech to now criminal 
action.
  The IHRA definition in what the House of Representatives passed last 
week in the Antisemitism Awareness Act doesn't limit speech in any way. 
In fact, it very specifically states it is not trying to take away any 
free speech rights of anyone. It specifically notes a protection for 
the First Amendment rights of Americans to be able to say what they 
choose to say.
  What it does say is, if you are on a college campus and you are 
choosing to discriminate against Jewish students, that should fall into 
the same as any other title VI discrimination falls into. It is no 
different. So if they are doing discrimination on a college campus, you 
can't just say: Well, they are discriminating against Jewish students, 
so that doesn't fall under title VI.
  That clearly does fall under title VI areas and makes what has been 
implied clear. What has been done by Executive action in the past under 
the Trump administration makes it clear for every administration. What 
has been done under the Department of State for three decades in the 
United States is clear policy not just for the State Department but 
also for the Department of Education. I think that is a pretty 
reasonable way to take on this issue and to be able to clarify what 
anti-Semitism is on a college campus or any campus that is out there.
  Some of the responses that I have already mentioned have been 
fascinating to me on this, things like I have already said: This is 
going to limit free speech.
  No. You still have the right to say something, even to say something 
dumb. That is still a protected right in the United States.
  We can say things that we both disagree with--that is a protected 
right--but you can't move into criminal activity. That is not 
protected, and a university cannot protect discrimination on their own 
campus. That would not be allowed.
  My favorite thing is that it does not outlaw the Bible. I have had 
folks who have said: If you put in the IHRA definition, it outlaws the 
Bible.
  I have just smiled and said: That is absolutely ridiculous.
  And it is not just me saying this. Christian leaders who I know all 
over the country say that is just a ridiculous statement.
  There is a letter that just came out this week from Pastor John 
Hagee, who leads what is called CUFI, the national Christians United 
for Israel, and Ralph Reed, who is the leader of the Faith and Freedom 
Coalition. They have made this simple statement:

       To the Biblically literate, claims that the Antisemitism 
     Awareness Act is anti-Christian are as insulting as they are 
     injurious.

  I have made it very clear on this as well when people have asked me 
about this, to say that somehow the Antisemitism Awareness Act outlaws 
the Bible or limits speech around the Bible.
  There is a statement in the IHRA definition that talks about using 
symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism, and the 
examples are claims that ``Jews killing Jesus are blood libel'' to 
characterize Israel or Israelis. So they take that one statement and 
pull that out and say: See? You couldn't use the Bible.
  I have laughed, and I have said: Well, I would just say not only have 
Pastor Hagee and others said this--and other faith leaders around--but 
let me add a voice to this as well. The Scripture is very clear from 
John 10 that Jesus laid his life down for others. He had the power to 
lay it down and the power to be able to take it up. That is Orthodox 
Christianity. Orthodox Christianity says: My sin is what put Jesus on 
the cross. That is what Scripture says.
  What the IHRA definition says is, if someone is biased to say ``I 
hate all Jews because Jews killed Jesus,'' they are saying that that is 
an anti-Semitic statement to say that. I would also say it is not only 
inconsistent with the clear teachings of Scripture, but it is 
inconsistent with the faith practices of individuals.
  Not only is the New Testament exceptionally clear about respect for 
Judaism, but the guy on the cross was Jewish. His mom at the foot of 
the cross was Jewish. The disciples were all Jewish. The people who 
wrote the New Testament were Jewish. So to somehow believe that 
Christianity would discount all Jews is to ignore the basic teachings 
of the New Testament, besides the basic fact that the Romans put Jesus 
on the cross.
  So somehow to say that this discounts Scripture--that I have heard 
over and over again on social media over the past week--I think is 
absurd, No. 1, and as John Hagee and Ralph Reed have said, it actually 
is insulting and injurious.
  There are folks who have said that there will be an international 
organization that is now going to police speech in the United States. I 
would encourage them to please read the legislation, not what is on 
social media, to be able to understand what this actually does. It does 
not give authority to an international organization to be able to step 
into the United States and be able to police speech. It is very clear.

  It just says this is what discrimination looks like under title VI, 
just like we have discrimination laws in other areas wherein the 
Department of Education could not say: Well, it doesn't specifically 
outline religion in this area, and so if there is discrimination 
against Jewish students, we can look the other way. That would stop 
under this piece of legislation.
  First things first: Let's actually have real dialogue as a country. 
Are we as a nation going to look the other way when students are 
discriminated against on a campus, or are we going to step in and say: 
``No, we are not going to just look the other way when there is 
discrimination''? Because, as I go back to the statement from our State 
Department, history has shown that wherever anti-Semitism has gone 
unchecked, the persecution of others has been present or not far 
behind. So let's speak out and stop it.
  For individuals who want to have anti-Semitic beliefs, that is still 
legal in America to have an anti-Semitic belief. It is still protected 
as a right. I would say it is hateful, and I would say it is bigoted, 
but it is still your protected right to be able to have that belief. 
But, when that speech moves to threats of violence and intimidation, 
when it moves from a voice to an action, that is criminal activity, and 
we should treat it as such. We should not let it fester as criminal 
activity and think it will not spread. It will.
  My final statement: For the folks who track through social media, 
where you see voices of anti-Semitism on social media, why don't you be 
bold enough to speak out for the people who are being bullied online 
and say every person has the right to their faith and to be able to 
live that faith and have that protected? We as Americans have the right 
to have any faith of our choosing, to change our faith, or to have no 
faith at all, and that would be protected. That should not be any less 
for Jewish students anywhere online or on their own campuses.
  So let's speak out on their behalf. And instead of allowing them to 
be bullied on their campuses or online, why don't we speak out for 
their right to be able to live their faith and practice their faith as 
every other American? That is what I think we should do on college 
campuses, and that is a simple way we can honor the dignity of every 
student.
  We are going to disagree. There are people who have strong 
disagreements

[[Page S3588]]

with the war that is happening right now in Israel and in Gaza. So 
let's talk about it, but let's not discriminate while we do it.

                       Remembering Kurt Englehart

  Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I am here today to honor the life of 
Kurt Englehart, my senior adviser, a beloved Nevadan, friend, and 
family member who touched so many lives.
  We lost Kurt very suddenly in April, and his loss is felt deeply by 
everyone in our office, some of whom are in the Galleries today, in the 
communities he impacted, and individuals he met throughout the State of 
Nevada, including--and I so appreciate my colleague Senator Rosen being 
here and her staff as well. You could tell how beloved he was by the 
sheer volume of people who came to his funeral in Reno. Last month, 
there were Tribal leaders, law enforcement, farmers, ranchers, labor 
leaders, former coworkers, and Senate staffers, childhood friends and 
Nevadans from across the State who showed up to pay their respects.
  Kurt touched so many lives, and he was able to make even strangers 
feel as though he was a close friend. Here is a picture of him, a photo 
of him, right here. There was always a smile on his face.
  For the past 8 years, Kurt was an essential part of my team. He liked 
to call it Team CCM, not only because of his intimate knowledge of 
every community in northern Nevada, but because he had this contagious 
warmth that drew everyone in. You couldn't dislike Kurt if you tried. 
He had this way of attacking life that brought so much positivity and 
joy to both my campaign and my Senate offices.
  I got to personally experience Kurt's zest for life on our many tours 
around rural Nevada. Every August, I travel through the rural counties 
in my State, and every August, Kurt was with me. That was when I got to 
know him the best. On the road, in the middle of the desert, I learned 
so much about Kurt's passions--about what inspired him to be so active 
in the community to the things that he enjoyed doing when he wasn't at 
the office.
  One of the favorite things to talk about for Kurt was his deep 
enthusiasm for video games. Kurt loved his gaming community, and they 
all loved him. One of his friends who played World of Warcraft with him 
reminisced about how Kurt, in the game, played a healer, which meant he 
took care of the other players.
  His friend said:

       I would later learn that this was how he was in the real 
     world.

  And that is exactly true. That is exactly how Kurt was in the real 
world, always making people feel at ease and extending a helping hand 
to those who needed it.
  In my Senate office, Kurt was a casework champion, addressing 
constituents' needs head on and working closely with Nevadans whose 
issues required special care and attention. Throughout his time in my 
office, Kurt worked on 638 cases. He was known by the Nevadans he 
worked with as a fierce advocate who knew how to get the job done for 
them.
  One casework story Kurt was particularly proud of--and I was as 
well--happened in 2019. Kurt reached out to a veteran named John, who 
was considering ending his own life because he couldn't afford his 
medical bills. John had been kicked off his insurance the day he 
experienced a massive health issue, leaving him with hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to pay out-of-pocket. Kurt found out about this 
when he talked with John. He worked with John's insurance company to 
make sure that they retroactively paid every penny of John's bill. Kurt 
actually saved John's life, and he was lucky to have Kurt as an 
advocate for him.

  That is just one example of Kurt's dedication to helping Nevadans in 
need. Whether he was working with the IRS to get people their tax 
refunds, advocating for the protection of sacred Tribal monuments, or 
resolving health benefit issues, Kurt gave each individual case his 
all. The Nevadans Kurt helped described him as going above and beyond 
to find solutions.
  Kurt made people feel heard, taking on the issues of complete 
strangers as if they were his own. And after the fact, he followed up 
with them to make sure they had everything they needed because that is 
who Kurt was. Public service came so naturally to him. He believed in 
the power of good government; that our democracy is truly for the 
people; that our work here in the Senate can change people's lives for 
the better, even if it is one person at a time.
  Kurt's determination to do the most good for the people of Nevada 
made him a giant all across the State and especially in our rural 
communities. Everyone from Reno to Elko, to our Tribal communities 
either knew Kurt personally or they knew of him. He drove from county 
to county talking with families, businessowners, farmers, ranchers, 
miners, Tribal leaders, and law enforcement about how our office could 
work with them and deliver for them. Democrats, Republicans, 
Independents--it did not matter--they all trusted Kurt to do the right 
thing by them, and he always did.
  Kurt was originally from Ohio, but he advocated for Nevadans so well 
that he truly became a Nevadan. He was the type of down-to-earth guy 
who could win over even those who staunchly disagreed with him. He 
showed up to every meeting fully prepared and well-informed, no matter 
the topic, and he was ready to have a productive conversation with 
anyone.
  And once Kurt made those connections, he maintained them. He got to 
know people on a deeper level and kept them in mind for future events 
he knew would interest them because he cared.
  He was so loved by his colleagues in all of our offices. My staff 
have described him as someone who ``charted his own path'' and ``always 
found a way.'' He was known for being a straight shooter whom everyone 
could depend upon to tell them exactly what he was thinking, even if it 
meant--and sometimes it did from Kurt--hearing the hard truth.
  When the work got intense--as it often does in Senate offices--Kurt 
would help his coworkers find the levity, even if he was just as 
frustrated as everyone else.
  If you knew anything about Kurt, you knew he loved his family above 
all else. His pride and joy was his son Ender. They shared a special 
bond in so many ways, particularly one, because like his father, Ender 
is a master video gamer as well as being an outstanding young man.
  Kurt cherished his family, and he talked about them endlessly: his 
mother Luann; his brother Matt; his girlfriend Siya; and Ender's mother 
Shaila. And he talked about Ender.
  I got a chance to know Ender growing from a young boy to a young 
teen. And I will tell you, Kurt's proudest moments were with his son, 
always wanting him to have every opportunity to take chances but not to 
be afraid to lean in and take those risks. The good, the bad, all of 
the above, his main goal was to ensure that his son Ender had every 
opportunity in life.
  Our office mourns this devastating loss, but we know Kurt will always 
be with us.
  This is actually Kurt on one of our coal trains in Ely, NV. It is one 
of the many examples of how Kurt spent his time getting around Nevada 
and talking to everyone who lived there. He lives on in the stories of 
the countless Nevadans he helped, and he lives on in the actions of 
those he inspired with his unwavering passion. And he lives on in the 
hearts of those of us who knew him the best. He will be dearly missed.
  I yield the floor.

                               REPORT Act

  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, this week, we are taking a big step 
forward in the fight to end online child exploitation. The bipartisan 
REPORT Act, which you and I led, has been signed into law, and now law 
enforcement and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children--
or NCMEC, as we call it--will have the resources that they need to 
better protect vulnerable children and track down these predators and 
pedophiles. This legislation has been urgently needed. And, Mr. 
President, I thank you for your leadership on this issue.
  Here is a frightening statistic: In America, a child is bought or 
sold for sexual exploitation once every 2 minutes. In this country, in 
2024, a child is

[[Page S3589]]

bought or sold for sex once every 2 minutes. This abuse increasingly 
happens in the virtual space, where predators distribute child sexual 
abuse material; they recruit minors into sex trafficking rings; and 
they extort children into sharing explicit images of themselves.
  Just last year, NCMEC received 36.2 million reports of online child 
sexual exploitation, a 23-percent increase over 2021.
  NCMEC, whose CyberTipline serves as our country's centralized 
reporting system for online child abuse, does incredible work to track 
down these crimes and report them to law enforcement. But, tragically, 
so many more acts of online sexual abuse against children are going 
unreported.
  Although criminal law requires electronic service providers to report 
any child sex abuse material on their sites, online platforms--
including Big Tech sites, such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram--have 
no obligation to report content involving the sex trafficking or 
grooming of children or enticement crimes.
  Most online platforms choose not to report this abhorrent material to 
law enforcement. And even when they do report the content, electronic 
service providers often omit necessary information to identify victims 
and track down their abusers.
  We have also heard from victims, their families, and law enforcement 
about the need to modernize laws around reporting online sexual abuse. 
For example, children and their parents risk legal liability for 
transferring evidence of online sexual abuse that they have experienced 
when submitting reports to the NCMEC CyberTipline.
  The REPORT Act addresses these issues and more to ensure that they 
are defending children against some of the most heinous crimes 
imaginable. Now, electronic service providers will be legally required 
to report child trafficking and enticement.
  To ensure compliance with the law, the REPORT Act raises the fine for 
first violations from $150,000 up to as much as $850,000, and 
subsequent violations, that fee is raised from $300,000 up to $1 
million.
  At the same time, the legislation enables victims to report evidence 
of online exploitation to the authorities and allows for the secure 
cloud storage and safe transfer of reports from NCMEC to law 
enforcement.
  It also increases the retention period for CyberTipline reports from 
90 days to 1 full year; meaning, law enforcement will have more time to 
track down and prosecute these criminals.
  All together, these measures will do so much to protect the most 
vulnerable among us from online exploitation and help to put an end to 
this horrific abuse.


                                Protests

  Mr. President, across the country, we are witnessing one of the worst 
waves of anti-Semitism that we have ever seen in our Nation's history. 
I appreciate that my colleague from Oklahoma spoke previously to this.
  One of the things that we have learned is a little bit about the 
leading perpetrators of these protests that are taking place. What we 
have found is that far-left activists, including college students at 
some of the most prestigious universities, are involved in these 
activities.
  We have all seen the pro-Hamas demonstrators who are harassing and 
intimidating Jewish students. They are blocking them from attending 
class or even from accessing public spaces. They are doing this with 
these protests and with these illegal encampments.
  Here are some examples of what we have had reported to us and what we 
have seen from individuals who are walking through these encampments 
with their cell phones. At Columbia University, activists chanted: ``We 
are Hamas'' and ``Long live Hamas.'' At George Washington University, 
one pro-Hamas demonstrator walked around campus with a sign calling for 
a ``Final Solution'' against the Jewish people.
  We have seen activists hand out fliers calling for ``Death to 
America'' and ``Death to Israeli real estate.'' And at schools like 
Princeton, students have waved the flag of terror groups, including the 
flag of Hezbollah.
  One thing should be obvious, the anti-Israel protests on campuses 
across this country are hotbeds for terrorist sympathizers and for 
anti-Jewish hatred. Never did I think I would see this in the United 
States of America.
  In fact, some of these college groups who are out protesting, 
including at Columbia, have allegedly held events with the terrorist 
organization Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. These 
demonstrations have absolutely no place in America, and Tennesseans are 
telling me these demonstrations have no place in our great State of 
Tennessee.
  But instead of cracking down on these activists and the students who 
are out there peddling anti-Semitism and are glorifying terrorism, many 
schools are beginning to bow to their demands. I find this abhorrent 
and disgusting.
  In negotiations with pro-Hamas demonstrators, Northwestern University 
agreed to offer coveted faculty positions to Palestinian academics and 
set aside full-ride scholarships for Palestinian students.
  To appease its pro-Hamas students, Brown University, last week, 
agreed to hold a vote on divesting from Israel.
  After negotiating with pro-Hamas activists for weeks, Columbia 
University has canceled its commencement ceremony.
  We can only bring an end to this disturbing illegal behavior when 
there are actual consequences.
  College students who promote terrorism on behalf of Hamas should be 
added to the TSA No Fly List, and we should deport foreign students on 
visas who support Hamas--a U.S.-designated terror organization. And 
universities that allow anti-Semitism on their campuses should be 
defunded. The Stop Anti-Semitism on College Campuses Act, which I 
introduced alongside Senator Tim Scott, would ensure that happens.

  Instead of standing up for Jewish students, President Biden has 
drawn, unfortunately, a moral equivalence between pro-Hamas activists 
and pro-Israel Americans. When asked about the anti-Semitic 
demonstrations last month, the President said he ``condemn[s] those who 
don't understand what is going on with the Palestinians.''
  At the same time, the President has focused on pushing billions in 
new illegal student loan forgiveness--forgiveness that could very well 
benefit the students who are out leading these demonstrations. So that 
is why I have joined my Senate Republican colleagues in introducing the 
No Bailouts for Campus Criminals Act, which would make any person who 
is convicted of a State or Federal offense in connection with a campus 
protest ineligible for any Federal student loan forgiveness.
  The President is also reportedly looking to welcome Gazans to America 
as refugees. According to a recent poll, 71 percent of Gazans said they 
supported Hamas's horrific October 7 attack on Israeli civilians. 
Seventy-one percent of Gazans said they supported Hamas's horrific 
attack on October 7. More than 300 individuals on the Terror Watchlist 
have entered our country under President Biden, but, for some reason, 
this administration thinks that they can vet Gazans, who elected Hamas 
as their government, who support the terrorist attack. They think they 
can properly vet them and bring them into this country? Have they not 
asked Egypt, Jordan, other countries in the region why they will not 
take these Palestinian refugees? I think it would be instructive.
  Our country cannot afford more failed leadership and not knowing who 
is coming into this country who may wish us harm. We would like to see 
the President rescind this and review his priorities and make it his 
priority to protect the American people.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to recognize what has been 
taking place this week in this country and around the world, and that 
is commemorating Yom HaShoah ending in 1945, recognizing the 6 million 
Jewish victims who were killed in the Holocaust.
  Sadly, on October 7 last year, 79 years after the Holocaust, we 
witnessed a terrorist organization, Hamas, rape, execute, and take 
hostages. Over 1,400 Israelis, Americans, and other nationalities were 
killed, which was the largest killing of Jews since the Holocaust.
  There is clear evidence of the rising threat of hate and anti-
Semitism being spread here at home and across the world.
  I commend President Biden and Speaker Johnson yesterday for bringing 
together a bipartisan gathering to speak against anti-Semitism and the 
challenges here in America. In the United States, anti-Semitic 
incidents have soared over 140 percent in 2023, breaking all previous 
records.
  In America, we support free speech and peaceful protests, but 
disrupting academic education and attacking Jewish students and faculty 
have no place on college campuses or universities in America. It must 
be stopped.
  We must unmask groups like the National Students for Justice in 
Palestine for what they are. They celebrated on October 8 the actions 
of Hamas that took 1,400 Israeli lives.
  This is an extension of terrorist groups like Hamas. Hamas' mission 
statement is to eliminate the State of Israel and to kill Jews, as 
referenced in their slogan: ``From the River to Sea.'' The river is the 
Jordan River, and the sea is the Mediterranean. Their purpose is to 
eliminate the State of Israel and kill Jewish people.
  We must work together to break this cycle of hate that is plaguing 
our society and putting lives at risk around the world. In an era of 
rising anti-Semitism coupled with fading memory of the Holocaust, we 
must fight conspiracy theories and ensure the lessons of the past are 
never ever forgotten.
  Last month, I was in Israel, and I went to the Nova concert site to 
witness the makeshift memorial where 364 concertgoers, innocent people, 
were killed on October 7.
  Last week, I participated in a bipartisan visit of Members to the 
Holocaust Museum for an exhibit that clearly raises the issues of anti-
Semitism in America in the 1920s and 1930s, which was led in part by 
prominent Americans like Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and others coming to Washington to 
go to see this comparative analogy of anti-Semitism from the 1920s and 
1930s to what we are dealing with here today. For it is real, and we 
must do everything together to combat this plague of anti-Semitism, the 
politics of hate, and the politics of fear. For as the famous historian 
George Santayana once said: ``Those who cannot remember the past are 
condemned to repeat it.''
  That is why it is important that we recognize this anniversary of the 
Holocaust and why we remember October 7 of last year. It is not a 
lingering, distant, fading memory. It is a reality that we have to deal 
with here today."

presidents cave to the demands of lawless encampments and anti-Semitic 
demands like cutting ties with Hillel or divesting from Israel or 
ending study abroad in Israel.
  Today brought the most egregious example yet where Sonoma State in 
California, not far from my district, not only agreed to the full set 
of BDS demands of the encampment but also agreed to convert the 
encampment into a permanent governing authority to assure that that 
agreement is enforced in a sufficiently anti-Semitic manner. I am not 
kidding. You almost can't believe this is real.
  It says the council here will be composed of members from the 
encampment, faculty, staff, administrators, Palestinian alumni, and 
other interested students as determined by Students for Justice in 
Palestine.
  Any university leader who is entering into these kind of agreements 
is elevating groups who are willing to engage in lawless action and to 
pursue their despicable agenda by force while silencing other groups

  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1227, I call 
up the bill (H.R. 8369) to provide for the expeditious delivery of 
defense articles and defense services for Israel and other matters, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Hinson). Pursuant to House Resolution 
1227, the bill is considered read.
  The text of the bill is as follows:

                               H.R. 8369

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Israel Security Assistance 
     Support Act''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a 
     massive, unprovoked war on Israel, killing over 1,200 
     innocent people and taking over 240 hostages, including 
     American citizens.
       (2) Since October 7, Israel has faced attacks by Iran and 
     its proxies including Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis, 
     which have required significant military responses.
       (3) Under the terms of a 2016 Memorandum of Understanding, 
     the United States provides Israel with $3.8 billion per year 
     in security assistance and missile defense funding from 
     fiscal years 2019 through 2028, which is subject to the 
     approval of Congress.
       (4) Thus far in fiscal year 2024, Congress has enacted 
     regular and supplemental legislation appropriating $12.5 
     billion in security assistance and missile defense for Israel 
     without any additional conditions.
       (5) Congress plays a vital role in oversight and approval 
     of direct commercial sales and foreign military sales to 
     security partners around the world, including Israel.
       (6) In May 2024, it was reported that President Biden 
     ordered a pause on certain defense articles ready for 
     imminent delivery to Israel, without having consulted with 
     Congress.
       (7) On May 8, 2024, President Biden stated regarding 
     Israel, ``We're not going to supply the weapons and artillery 
     shells''.

     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       Congress--
       (1) condemns the Biden Administration's decision to pause 
     certain arms transfers to Israel as Israel faces 
     unprecedented threats from Iran and its proxies, including 
     Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis;
       (2) calls on the Biden Administration to allow all 
     previously approved arms transfers to Israel to proceed 
     quickly to ensure that Israel can defend itself and defeat 
     threats from Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah, 
     Hamas, and the Houthis;
       (3) calls on the Biden Administration to utilize all 
     congressionally appropriated funds for security assistance 
     for Israel as Congress intended;
       (4) stands with Israel as it defends itself against the 
     barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists; and
       (5) reaffirms Israel's right to self-defense.

     SEC. 4. PROHIBITION.

       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available 
     under any Act appropriating funds for the Department of 
     Defense or the Department of State for fiscal year 2024 or 
     any prior years may be made available--
       (1) to withhold, halt, reverse, or cancel the delivery of 
     defense articles or defense services from the United States 
     to Israel; or
       (2) to pay the salary or expenses of any officer or 
     employee of the Department of Defense or the Department of 
     State who takes any action to support or further the 
     withholding, halting, reversal, or cancellation of the 
     delivery of such defense articles or services.

                             General Leave

  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this measure.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, Hamas' October 7 massacre was as cruel, barbaric, and 
bloody as anything I have ever seen. Hamas unleashed pure evil on 
Israel that day. The Hamas terrorists filmed themselves committing 
brutal atrocities because they were so proud of their barbaric acts.
  In fact, in just hours they murdered 1,200 innocent people and took 
over 250 hostages, including Americans. I say this to remind my 
colleagues of the moral clarity that we as a body felt in the aftermath 
of these brutal attacks.
  It was obvious to us then that Hamas was ruthless. It was obvious to 
us that Hamas needed to be eradicated to ensure Israel's security. It 
was obvious to us that Hamas would fight dirty and use innocent 
civilians as human shields. It was obvious to us that Israel had no 
choice but to win this war and end the perpetual terrorist threat.
  We all, Republicans and Democrats, spent those weeks talking about 
our steadfast support for Israel, our ironclad commitment. In fact, Mr. 
Meeks and I introduced a bipartisan resolution condemning Hamas in 
support of Israel which had more cosponsors than any other resolution 
in the history of the Congress.
  However, today, I am deeply disappointed that for some in this 
country and for the administration that that moral clarity has faded, 
that their ironclad commitment apparently is not, in fact, ironclad.
  In an about-face, the Biden administration is now withholding 
critical arms necessary for Israel to win this war. This administration 
wants to dictate how Israel executes the war that they were thrust 
into.
  They did not ask for this war. They did not start this war. Hamas 
started this war.
  Just recently, though, President Biden said that if they go into 
Rafah, I am not supplying the weapons, period. That would be similar 
for us, Madam Speaker, to say during World War II, my father's war, 
that you can invade all the way up to Berlin, but you can't go into 
Berlin to finish the job. Imagine if we had done that with our Allies 
back then.
  Israel is in a fight for its very existence, and this 
administration's public break with Israel has only made negotiations 
and victory more difficult.
  Rafah is a final key military objective to complete the mission 
against Hamas.
  Israel has effectively eradicated 19 battalions throughout Gaza, yet 
4 remain in Rafah. This is the last stage of the military operation, 
and it keeps getting delayed and delayed and delayed.
  We know that Hamas is exploiting this cease-fire and using the 
negotiation process just to buy more time.
  Hamas has established a network of tunnels that total over 300 miles 
in Gaza. These tunnels of terror are where they are holed up ready to 
strike Israel at the first opportunity.
  Their use of tunnels is why Israel must use these larger bombs, to 
destroy their command and control centers and eliminate the terrorists 
that find refuge in them.
  By the way, contrary to what has been said publicly, these bombs when 
applied with JDAM kits can become precision-guided weapons. Precision 
means just that, precise. It goes straight to the target without 
collateral damage, and it does, indeed, protect innocent civilians.
  We know that Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas, is somewhere around 
these tunnels. Taking him out is critical to defeating Hamas.
  Madam Speaker, as the saying goes: War is hell. War is horrific. War 
is messy. Nobody wants war. Israel did not start this war; Hamas did. 
Sadly, civilian casualties are part of urban warfare. Israel has 
limited this number greatly and is opening all routes for humanitarian 
assistance.
  This is despite the fact that Hamas are the ones who use human 
shields, hide behind hospitals and schools, and put civilians in harm's 
way.
  It was Hamas that destroyed the Erez checkpoint on October 7, 
significantly impeding aid from getting into Gaza. Since then, they 
have repeatedly attacked another checkpoint that serves as a major 
artery of aid into Gaza. Egypt also is currently delaying aid through 
the Rafah checkpoint.
  Just the other day, I saw a video of Hamas killing their own people, 
Palestinian children simply trying to get food out of the trucks, as 
they gunned down their own people.
  Until Israel finishes the last major operation to remove Hamas from 
power, to defeat the remaining battalions that are in Rafah, we will 
never have the peaceful resolution that everybody wants. For until 
Rafah is destroyed and Hamas is destroyed, we will not be able to get 
to the peace talks with the Saudis and Israel and the other Arab 
nations that everyone is so optimistic about.
  I can only think of one purpose to withhold these weapons. This 
administration is more concerned about a small vocal wing of activists 
than the ironclad commitment that they talked about to stand by Israel.
  Under this administration, I have noticed a disturbing trend, a trend 
where we turn our backs on our allies and fall short of the promises we 
make.
  That is why this legislation is so important. It will ensure the 
weapons are delivered to Israel, and it will reassure our allies that 
when America makes a commitment, we keep it.
  Think about this, Madam Speaker: What kind of a message is this 
sending both to our allies and friends and our adversaries and enemies? 
To our allies, it sends a message that we cannot be trusted. To our 
adversaries, it sends a message that they no longer fear us. It does 
not send a message of deterrence. It sends a message of weakness. It 
invites conflict, aggression, and now, yes, war.
  Imagine if Iran cut off its weapons to Hezbollah and cut off its 
weapons to the Houthi rebels, what would be said of Iran? What would be 
our impression?
  They believe they have achieved victory, Madam Speaker, without a 
shot fired, a victory handed to them by this administration tying the 
hands of Israel, one hand behind its back, as it moves into the final 
stage of this war to complete its final mission.

                              {time}  1230

  Prime Minister Netanyahu says: I will do this alone if I have to.
  He should not have to do this alone. We need to stand with our ally, 
Israel, stand with her and stand with her to defeat this terrorist 
organization, Hamas, and bring a final closure and a peaceful 
resolution to the Middle East.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose H.R. 8369, which is a cynical, 
political exercise by my GOP colleagues to attempt to sow division and 
use the United States-Israel relationship and American security 
assistance to advance their own political agenda.
  Despite what you have heard and will hear from the other side of the 
aisle today, Madam Speaker, there is no bigger champion for Israel's 
long-term security as a Jewish state than President Joe Biden. As I am, 
the President is committed to eliminating Hamas, and that is clear by 
what took place recently when he defended, along with other allies, 
Israel from an Iranian attack.
  He visited Israel during wartime, and he has delivered unprecedented 
aid. To suggest that he is abandoning or harming Israel is absurd. He 
has been with Israel as a Senator, as a Vice President, and as a 
President. To insinuate that now, all of a sudden, he is not with 
Israel is not true at all.
  Now, I hear my Republican colleagues argue that leveraging 2,000-
pound bombs should not have been

[[Page H3289]]

done publicly. That approach has not worked. For months, the Biden 
administration publicly and privately urged Israel not to launch a 
major offensive in Rafah without credible plans to avoid mass 
casualties and to try to evacuate Palestinians to a safe space.
  The United States has also repeatedly pressed Israel to cease using 
large warhead ordnance that results in excessive civilian casualties in 
densely populated civilian areas. Our humanitarian values are to try to 
save innocent lives, not saving Hamas, but trying to save innocent men, 
women, and children while we pursue Hamas--not cutting off all weapons, 
cutting off these huge bombs that kill innocent individuals--by 
utilizing munitions that are more appropriate for urban warfare to get 
Hamas.
  To date, Israel has presented no plan to mitigate civilian harm or 
commitment to not using the 2,000-pound bombs in Rafah. To the 
contrary, what we heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu last week was 
that he repeatedly affirmed Israel's plans for an all-out assault on 
Rafah. That is when the Biden administration confirmed it would 
temporarily withhold a small number of large warhead bombs so that they 
would not be used in Rafah.
  My Republican friends also seem to think that President Biden's 
actions are unprecedented, but there is a history of the United States 
withholding certain security assistance to Israel. Many of my GOP 
colleagues call themselves Reagan Republicans. Recall that President 
Reagan did the exact same thing based on concerns with Israel's 
military actions on two occasions in 1981 and 1982.
  These 2,000-pound bombs in question can create a crater up to 50 feet 
wide and 36 feet deep when dropped. They have a lethal fragmentation to 
a radius the size of multiple football fields. Such bombs have no place 
in urban combat, not in Gaza and not in Rafah, one of the most densely 
populated areas on the planet. The United States has a duty and 
obligation under law to make sure our weapons are not 
disproportionately killing civilians.
  This bill, H.R. 8369, prohibits the Biden administration from 
exercising its executive branch prerogative in holding or suspending 
U.S. arms transfers to Israel, including these large warhead munitions 
and any other defense article.
  It also forces the administration to deliver any such item to Israel 
within 15 days of enactment and, if the administration is unable to 
comply, it freezes significant parts of the Defense Department, the 
State Department, and the National Security Council budgets. According 
to the Defense Department itself: Withholding defense-wide operations 
and maintenance funds would jeopardize DOD's ability to fulfill its 
constitutional obligation to defend the United States which could cause 
significant harm to United States national security.
  Further, these budgetary freezes would undermine U.S. defense 
leadership when we are simultaneously competing in the Indo-Pacific, 
supporting Ukraine in its fight against the Russian war of aggression, 
and working with our partners in sub-Saharan Africa on security 
challenges. Again, this is all tremendously dangerous for our own 
national security.
  The bill also includes a blatantly political attack on military 
officers, hardworking civil servants, and U.S. Government employees by 
mandating Inspector General investigations into individuals, not 
agencies or departments, and orders the withholding of their salaries 
in a brazen and politicized witch hunt.
  All of these concerns would have been made clear had my Republican 
colleagues not rushed this bill through without any kind of regular 
order. Had it been marked up in the Foreign Affairs Committee, we would 
have been able to highlight that this legislation undercuts a number of 
crucial existing United States laws that are in the Foreign Affairs 
Committee's jurisdiction, including the Arms Export Control Act, the 
Leahy Law, and executive branch policies including the Conventional 
Arms Transfer Policy and National Security Memorandum 20.
  Let me repeat: President Biden paused one arms shipment. One. The 
President continues to focus on freeing the hostages, to put the onus 
on Hamas to reach a deal, and supports Israel's right to eradicate 
Hamas.
  That is the position of President Joseph R. Biden. Let's be clear 
about it.
  In conclusion, consider the facts and the context. We should oppose 
this bill moving forward because it is not good for Israel, and it is 
not good for the United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, let me just say, first, with respect to the 
first President I had the honor to vote for, Ronald Reagan, in 1982, it 
was concluded that Israel was violating U.S. and international laws by 
their use of cluster munitions.

  In this case, the Biden administration actually concluded in a 
national security memo that Israel was not violating U.S. and 
international laws. Yet, the President still announced his plan to 
withhold all defensive weapons to Israel. That is a very different 
situation, and I wanted to rectify and clarify the Record on that.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Calvert), who is the author of this bill and the chairman of the 
Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Israel 
Security Assistance Support Act. This bill reverses President Biden's 
misguided attempts to withhold vital security assistance to Israel as 
they fight to defend their citizens from terrorists.
  Just last week, we observed Holocaust Remembrance Day, commemorating 
the 6 million Jews who were murdered by Nazi Germany. The memory of 
those lives horrifically taken endures 80 years since the end of the 
Holocaust. A plaque at Auschwitz states: ``Those who cannot remember 
the past are condemned to repeat it.''
  Mr. Speaker, we can never forget.
  On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a massive, unprovoked 
war on Israel, killing 1,200 innocent people and taking 240 hostages, 
including American citizens. It was the worst attack on the Jewish 
people since the Holocaust.
  The Israeli people are still reeling from the barbaric attacks on 
that day. They are unable to begin healing while still separated from 
their loved ones taken hostage, and they are determined to ensure no 
further innocent Israeli lives are taken by radical terrorists.
  Over the past 6 months, Israel has been repeatedly attacked by Iran 
and its terrorist proxy groups: Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis. Each 
one of these groups has vowed repeatedly to destroy the State of 
Israel.
  The only reason these attacks have been unsuccessful is because of 
Israel's robust military and because of their missile defense 
capability, honed by years of defending itself from attacks.
  Hamas and others who seek the end of the Jewish state have not run 
out of weapons, resources, or willpower. In this unprovoked conflict 
they started, they are using none of these things to defend innocent 
civilians, preferring to use them instead as human shields.
  Hamas has made a choice to continue the conflict by tormenting their 
hostages and hiding behind civilians. It is time to stop appeasing 
terrorists and provide Israel with the weapons and support necessary to 
end this war.
  The United States affirmed our resolve to stand with Israel less than 
a month ago when we passed supplemental appropriations for Israel with 
strong bipartisan support. This message could not have been clearer.
  Astoundingly, last week, The Washington Post reported that President 
Biden ordered a pause on weapons ready for delivery to Israel--
literally on the truck ready to be sent to the airport and flown out to 
Israel immediately. These are weapons that were previously approved by 
Congress and the administration. These include 1,800 2,000-pound bombs 
and 1,700 500-pound bombs that are intended to strike Hamas' extensive 
tunnel network.
  It was also reported that the administration was reviewing planned 
transfers of 6,500 joint direct attack munition kits which would bring 
precision to the fight and help minimize civilian casualties.
  The Biden administration is ignoring the fact that the State of 
Israel is surrounded by people who want to destroy them. Iran does not 
recognize Israel and has called for its elimination. Hamas is committed 
to the destruction of Israel, and Hezbollah's primary goal

[[Page H3290]]

is the elimination of Israel. Iran and its proxies are only deterred 
through strength, which is why the U.S. must continue to provide 
weapons to Israel.
  Unable to deter Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, or any other nefarious actor 
seeking to attack the Jewish state, the Biden administration instead is 
suppressing a close ally.
  Members on both sides of the aisle have called for President Biden to 
reverse his decision. The administration should not ignore the will of 
Congress as evident through overwhelming bipartisan legislative action.
  Unfortunately, the Biden administration's decision made it necessary 
for me, along with Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, State 
and Foreign Operations Subcommittee Chairman Mario Diaz-Balart, and 
Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee Chairman David 
Joyce to introduce the Israel Security Assistance Support Act.
  This bill prevents the Defense and State Departments from withholding 
the delivery of weapons to Israel; requires the administration to 
ensure prompt delivery of weapons to Israel; mandates that anything 
withheld from delivery to Israel be delivered within 15 days and 
withholds funds until they are delivered; requires all assistance to 
Israel be obligated within 30 days; requires the Inspectors General to 
report on actions taken by executive branch officials to withhold 
security assistance to Israel. It also includes comprehensive reporting 
on weapons deliveries to Israel to ensure congressional intent is met.

                              {time}  1245

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Langworthy). The time of the gentleman 
has expired.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from California.
  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, it is appalling that this legislation is 
necessary. The reaction of the Biden administration proves that it is. 
A veto threat and a $1 billion unrelated aid package were announced 
almost simultaneously once it became clear that the House intended to 
take action on that this week.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, to correct the record, President Biden never 
said, as I hear my colleagues saying, that he is suspending all weapons 
to Israel. He said specifically the 2,000-pound bombs that cause death 
to innocent Palestinians are the only things that were paused here, not 
all weapons.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Sherman).
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, my pro-Israel efforts began long before my 
28 years on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I believe that my pro-
Israel record is as long and as strong as any Member of this House.
  I rise to oppose this pseudo pro-Israel bill. It purports to deal 
with this issue of 2,000-pound bombs. As the ranking member has pointed 
out, suspensions occurred also under Reagan and Ford. More 
significantly, this is just a communicative act. It has no strategic 
significance.
  Israel already has such a large stockpile of 2,000-pound bombs and 
similar weapons that the administration is going to be providing many 
thousands of JDAM kits to turn those dumb bombs into smart bombs.
  The chair is working with several of us on a much better response to 
this suspension, and I look forward to that working its way through the 
committee. No one should be tempted to vote for this bill. There will 
be a better bill.
  This bill does nothing to help Israel strategically, but it attacks 
Israel at its two weakest points. The first is bipartisan support. 
Israel has one friend in the world. It cannot afford to have only one-
half of one friend.
  We saw that bipartisan support when 85 percent of Democrats and 85 
percent of Republicans voted to provide Israel with $14 billion of 
extraordinary aid, but this resolution has poison pills, including 
condemning Biden by name, in a clear effort to get as little Democratic 
support as possible.
  Second, this bill attacks Israel's international image. Israel, in 
fact, meets American international standards for minimizing civilian 
casualties, but what this bill does is it exempts Israel from the Leahy 
and similar laws, in effect declaring from this Congress to the world 
that Israel can't meet the standard.
  Israel is doing at least as good a job as any military in the history 
of urban warfare. The report from the Biden administration wasn't as 
clear as it should be on that but reached the right conclusion.
  Congress should not step forward and exempt Israel from a test that 
Israel clearly meets. That is poison on the international stage.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), an original cosponsor of this bill and 
chairman of the Committee on Appropriations' Subcommittee on State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Israel Security 
Assistance Support Act.
  The reason we are here is because the Biden administration, despite 
all the rhetoric, has broken its so-called ironclad commitment to 
Israel by halting shipments of weapons at a time when Israel needs them 
the most. These are weapons not only that Israel has asked for but that 
President Biden himself asked Congress to provide. This 
administration's argument is that the bill undermines the President's 
ability to ``execute an effective foreign policy.''
  Does anyone really believe that this administration has an effective 
foreign policy? Do I need to remind my colleagues of what the former 
Secretary of Defense, Mr. Gates, said of Mr. Biden, that ``he has been 
wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue 
over the past four decades''?
  What the administration doesn't understand, Mr. Speaker, is what an 
effective foreign policy requires. It requires having the ability to 
distinguish allies from enemies, those fighting for their lives in 
self-defense versus terrorists seeking to kill, harm, and destroy them.
  Israel must do what is necessary to eradicate that depraved terrorist 
group, Hamas, a proxy of terrorist state Iran, the same Iran which 
also, for the first time ever, under the weakness of this 
administration, directly attacked Israel.
  Israel needs these weapons to eradicate the terrorists who have vowed 
the destruction of Israel, and Israel needs it to protect itself and 
its people. Withholding vital resources jeopardizes not only Israel's 
ability to defend itself but also our national security by harming and 
weakening our strongest ally.
  In the Biden administration's veto threat, Mr. Speaker, it says that 
the rationale was to prevent unintended consequences, with no other 
explanation, by the way. What about the likely consequences of failure 
to fully support Israel now when they need it? Does the administration 
doubt that Hamas will seize any opening, any opportunity, to further 
maim, torture, and kill?
  Congress approved the supplemental in a bipartisan way, and we expect 
the administration to follow the law and to deliver. We cannot stand by 
while the Biden administration tries to force Israel to fight for its 
very own existence with one hand tied behind its back.
  I thank my colleagues, Chairman Calvert, Chairman Cole, Chairman 
Joyce, the Speaker, and Leader Scalise, for bringing this very 
important bill to the floor. It is time to tell the administration: 
Keep your word. Support Israel. Follow the law. Send the weapons that 
you, Mr. President, and Israel requested.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this 
political bill. This is not about policy. It is about politics. What a 
shame.
  This is not in Israel's best interests. It is not in this Congress' 
best interests. The gentleman who just spoke, spoke with passion, 
immediacy, and urgency. Unfortunately, House Republican leadership has 
sought to turn it into a partisan issue on multiple occasions. This 
legislation is their latest attempt.
  They claim President Biden is delaying some portion of aid. Where was

[[Page H3291]]

that outrage, I ask my colleagues, when, on November 2, you brought a 
bill to this floor with a poison pill that you knew would not pass and 
would not be signed by the President of the United States?
  If it had been a clean bill, as I told you then, it would have passed 
with over or approximately 400 votes, but you waited 7 months--not 20 
days--7 months. Where was the outrage when we waited 7 months to give 
Israel aid?
  Also, by the way, we delayed on Ukraine, as well. Where was the 
outrage? I was told over and over again: Well, the Speaker is going to 
bring it to the floor sometime. He says he is going to bring it to the 
floor. Seven months--one, two, three--time went by. Where was the 
outrage then?
  This is a political bill that does not help Israel, does not help 
America, and should be defeated.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their 
remarks to the Chair.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Self), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. SELF. Mr. Speaker, as a special operator in the United States 
Army, our commitment to each other was to leave no man behind. Our 
Commander in Chief does not hold to that doctrine.
  President Biden has not only turned his back on our ally Israel, but 
he has also abandoned the Americans still being held hostage by Hamas.
  My fellow Americans, this used to mean something. U.S. citizens have 
been held by terrorists for over 220 days, very reminiscent of the 
waning days of the Democratic Carter administration when American 
hostages were left in Iran for 444 days. They were released just 
minutes after President Reagan took the oath of office.
  I pray the hostages in Gaza will not suffer at the hands of Hamas for 
another 224 days. We don't even hear the Biden administration 
mentioning American hostages.
  Make no mistake, President Biden is aiding and abetting Hamas 
terrorists instead of supporting Israel.
  I can just imagine the terrorists playing an endless loop of Democrat 
sound bites to the hostages, saying your President is on our side, with 
headlines like: ``Biden Just Betrayed Israel--and Rewarded Hamas,'' 
``U.S. withholding `sensitive intelligence' on Hamas from Israel,'' 
``Biden Admin Wants Israeli Forces To `Get Out Of Gaza,''' and 
``Pentagon chief confirms U.S. pause on weapons shipment to Israel.''
  While our Commander in Chief signals weakness to the world and 
support to terrorists, I am here to send a message to those being held 
hostage: You are not forgotten. Congress must fight to get you out in 
spite of obstacles put in place by Democrats and terrorists.
  Mr. Speaker, we must support Israel's right to eradicate Hamas, and 
we must bring our hostages home immediately.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Schneider), a member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee.
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, today is the 223rd day since Hamas 
slaughtered more than 1,200 people, including 45 Americans. More than 
250 people were taken hostage, and 132 are still held, including 8 
Americans.
  After October 7, President Biden immediately stepped in to help the 
Jewish state. He traveled to Israel 11 days after the attacks, the 
first President to do so in wartime. He dispatched two carrier strike 
groups and has sent hundreds of shipments of weapons to Israel.
  When Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel, the 
U.S. worked with our allies to defeat that attack. President Biden and 
Secretaries Blinken and Austin have repeatedly clarified that U.S. 
support for Israel is ironclad, and they continue to match those words 
with action, this week approving another $100 billion in arms sales to 
Israel.

  While the administration is doing everything in its power to support 
our allies, Republicans in Congress play politics.
  In the early weeks of the Gaza war, the majority tried to condition 
aid to Israel on Republican cuts to IRS funding. It took fully 6 months 
after October 7 for Republicans to finally put the emergency security 
funding on the floor. It passed overwhelmingly with 366 votes. The 
delay was clearly partisan.
  Let me be clear: It is wrong to withhold even just one shipment of 
weapons to Israel in its fight as it fights an existential, multifront 
war. It is okay for friends to disagree, but we must not send mixed 
signals to Israel's enemy about U.S. support for the mission to end 
Hamas' reign of terror over Gaza, to eliminate the threat to Israel, 
and to bring the hostages home.
  Sadly, Speaker Johnson's approach is different. He drafted a partisan 
bill with no path forward. It didn't even go through the Foreign 
Affairs Committee, where we could have fixed it.
  I can't imagine anyone in this body believes that automatically 
zeroing out the budget for the Departments of State and Defense and the 
National Security Council in the case of delayed arms is a good idea. 
It is a terrible, dangerous idea, and it is the reason I must vote 
against this bill.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. McClintock), chairman of the Committee on the 
Judiciary's Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and 
Enforcement, and an original cosponsor of this bill.

                              {time}  1300

  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, on December 8, 1941, Franklin Roosevelt 
stood in this very Hall and asked for a declaration of war against the 
government that had attacked our fleet the day before at Pearl Harbor, 
and he solemnly pledged to win through to absolute victory.
  On October 7, Hamas targeted and butchered innocent and unarmed women 
and children. Israel not only has a right to defeat Hamas, it has a 
moral duty to do so. The killing on both sides can only end with the 
unconditional surrender of Hamas. The sooner that day comes, the better 
for all humanity.
  Now to hasten that day, the President requested, and the Congress 
provided, the precision bombs and other munitions that Israel needs to 
quickly bring this war to an end while minimizing civilian casualties. 
Now that same President is withholding that aid while sending billions 
of dollars of supplies into Gaza before Hamas has surrendered.
  This act is treacherous, and it must not stand. This measure says so.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, let me just say this really quickly. One of 
the speakers before him said Democrats and terrorists are against 
Israel. That just shows how political this is.
  Democrats and Republicans have always been with Israel. To try and 
distort it and say Democrats are against Israel shows that it is just a 
partisan argument and not for the benefit of Israel. It is for trying 
to play politics with this issue.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Castro), the ranking member of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee.
  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 8369 
because Joe Biden did the right thing. He made the right decision.
  The United States is a friend to the people of Israel. The United 
States is not a rubberstamp to an extremist Prime Minister who has not 
prioritized the release of hostages, who has allowed for indiscriminate 
killings in Gaza, and who has put his own political survival above all 
else.
  Chairman McCaul said something I think that was very important. After 
October 7, the world stood with Israel, expressed support for Israel. I 
believe all of us did in a bipartisan way.
  What has happened since then? Prime Minister Netanyahu has ruined the 
world's support. He has done so by not focusing on the hostages, but by 
allowing his military to bomb hospitals, ambulance convoys, people's 
homes, to take out journalists, aid workers, including Americans. The 
moral compass does not bend in favor of one nation regardless of what 
it does. That is why the President has done what he has done, and the 
President's leverage matters.
  When President Biden has taken steps to exercise his leverage, we 
have

[[Page H3292]]

seen immediate results. Last month, President Biden told Israel to open 
the Erez Crossing in northern Gaza, and 3 days ago, dozens of WFP flour 
trucks entered through the western Erez Crossing, bringing desperately 
needed food to starving families.
  After the President paused a 2,000-pound bomb shipment, less than 1 
percent of the total weapons shipments to Israel, the Israeli Defense 
Minister raised concerns for the first time that Netanyahu has no plan 
to rescue the hostages or establish a functioning Palestinian 
Government in Gaza.
  This, in many ways, is our last chance. We must do the right thing 
ourselves.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. Clyde), a member of the Committee on Appropriations.
  Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 8369, 
the Israel Security Assistance Support Act.
  This critical bill ensures defense articles and services are 
delivered quickly to our steadfast ally, Israel, as they face 
unprecedented threats from Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iran.
  On October 7, Iran-backed Hamas terrorists brutally attacked Israel, 
murdering, raping, and torturing more than 1,200 innocent civilians, 
and abducting over 240 others to Gaza as hostages, including American 
citizens.
  In the following months since this unprovoked terrorist attack, 
Israel has continued to be under constant assault by Iran and its 
proxies. We must support our ally, Israel, and ensure that they have 
the weapons they need to defend themselves, including the small arms, 
the 50,000 rifles that the Israeli Government has on order that is 
being held up by our State Department, and the precision-guided 
munitions.
  It is doublespeak. It is unconscionable that the Biden administration 
complains about civilian collateral damage when they are withholding 
the exact munitions that minimize civilian collateral damage.
  H.R. 8369 would ensure that all previously approved arms transfers to 
Israel can move forward without interruption, as well as prohibit funds 
from being used to stop or cancel the shipment of defense items to 
Israel. In addition, it would require the timely shipment of any items 
that have been stopped or delayed by President Biden and the Biden 
administration to be sent within 15 days after enactment.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this critical 
legislation.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).
  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to 
this bill, which, despite what the authors claim, threatens to defund 
our national security and torch the indispensable U.S.-Israel 
relationship, and it is all being done to score cheap political points.
  By now we are accustomed to Republicans bringing up nonsensical 
messaging bills to distract from the fact that they blocked vital aid 
to Israel for 6 months.
  Last week, I spoke out against the delayed weapons shipment and urged 
the U.S. and Israel to resolve disagreements privately to maintain the 
united front against Hamas.
  The White House and Israel are now clear that those weapons are not 
needed for the Rafah operation. Just this week, the Biden 
administration finalized more than a billion dollars in assistance to 
Israel. Instead of coming together to show bipartisan support for 
Israel's defense, Republicans return to their political playbook, 
cynically exploiting Israel as a political wedge issue. However, this 
isn't another nonbinding resolution.

  This dangerous, cynical bill is not pro-America or pro-Israel. The 
bill before us threatens to block funds to our military, the same Armed 
Forces which defended Israel against an Iranian missile onslaught.
  This bill also imperils our diplomats who work nonstop to get 
hostages released. Undercutting American security undercuts Israel's 
security.
  A plan to defund U.S. national security agencies that send 
assistance, share intelligence, and help defeat Hamas is exactly how 
you cut off your nose to spite your face.
  October 7 made clear that Israel's needs can evolve overnight. I 
won't abide by Republicans holding our national security hostage so 
they can micromanage our Commander in Chief and feign how pro-Israel 
and pro-military they are.
  If you don't like the President holding up one limited shipment for a 
week, and I don't, you should be livid about Speaker Johnson holding up 
all military aid for 6 months.
  I won't allow shortsighted, partisan stunts to masquerade as 
bipartisan support for Israel. Republicans need to stop the games. 
Israel needs real, consistent support, not Republican users who have 
repeatedly made it clear that Israel cannot count on them.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Kiley).
  Mr. KILEY. Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of the Israel 
Security Assistance Support Act.
  President Biden's threat to withhold aid from Israel is reckless, 
unjustifiable, and indecent. It flies in the face of the bipartisan 
support this House recently showed for continuing support of Israel. 
The American public understands the importance of the American-Israel 
relationship, how it is in the national security interests of both 
countries.
  The American public understands that Israel is our longstanding ally, 
a democracy in a region that has very few of them; whereas, Hamas is a 
terrorist organization that has committed historic atrocities and would 
not hesitate to do so again.
  The President is catering to the most radical elements of his party, 
the sort of elements that have unleashed chaos on college campuses 
across this country. It is vitally important that reasonable people on 
both sides of the aisle come together to reassert our support for 
Israel as it struggles against this terrorist organization.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. Goldman).
  Mr. GOLDMAN of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud 
American Jew who steadfastly supports Israel's right to exist as a 
democratic Jewish state and its right to defend itself after Hamas' 
barbaric and unprovoked attack on October 7.
  The United States must continue to support Israel, to defeat Hamas, 
release the hostages, including Americans stuck in Gaza, and provide 
all funding, weapons, and intelligence necessary in order to do that, 
and that is President Biden's clear policy, as well.
  This bill does not do any of that. It does not support Israel. It 
does not provide any additional funding, any additional weapons, nor 
any additional support for Israel. Even though Republicans delayed for 
6 months, I was pleased when this body finally, in a show of 
bipartisanship, voted to support Israel with the supplemental aid 
package several weeks ago. This bill is designed to undermine that 
bipartisan support, which Israel desperately needs.
  As a Jew, I am, frankly, sick and tired of the Republican Party using 
Israel as a political weapon to divide us, which aids Hamas, Iran, and 
Israel's enemies.
  Mr. Speaker, I have one simple request of my Republican colleagues: 
If you truly care about Israel, please stop using it as a divisive 
political pawn. Just stop.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the 
great State of Texas (Mr. Pfluger), a member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee and an original cosponsor of this bill.
  Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, last month, Congress passed the Israel 
security supplemental with overwhelmingly bipartisan support, but now 
the President is holding security assistance to our ally, Israel, 
hostage.
  Let's not forget that Hamas is responsible for this massacre on 
October 7, with over 1,400 people being murdered and all the horrific 
actions that have taken place. President Biden's decision to withhold 
weapons from Israel is a disgrace that will harm Israel's capacity to 
defend itself. It is yet another foreign policy failure that will 
prolong the conflict and make things worse in the Middle East.
  House Republicans are leading and demonstrating steadfast commitment 
to Israel, our most important and longest-standing ally in the Middle 
East,

[[Page H3293]]

but the Biden administration is choosing to betray the will of 
Congress. The President doesn't get to pick and choose when he follows 
the law and when he does not.
  Congress must act quickly to reverse this decision and stand with 
Israel. Support for Israel's defense against the threats from Iran and 
its proxies, including Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis is not a 
political decision; it is the right decision.
  The United States stands with Israel, and I urge support of this.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. Doggett).
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, horrified by seeing a baby's arm blown off, 
the President successfully demanded the Israeli Prime Minister to halt 
the bombing.
  President Ronald Reagan also halted deliveries of weapons, but 
today's Republicans don't want America to lead; they would defer the 
decisions about the best course for America to Netanyahu and Ben-Gvir. 
They would place us on a disastrous path of isolation and greater 
Mideast instability.
  They attack President Biden now for halting delivery of 2,000-pound 
dumb bombs that are used in ways he rightly described as 
``indiscriminate bombing'' that pulverizes large areas and kills and 
mutilates thousands of innocent women and children.
  Leveling Gaza, starving, and killing a multitude offers Israel no 
genuine victory over Hamas, no end to the cycle of violence.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Weber of Texas). The time of the 
gentleman has expired.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the 
gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, Hamas can never be a genuine partner for 
peace, but Netanyahu, so willing to sacrifice the hostages and protect 
himself, is also obstructing peace. Limiting the flow of bombs is a 
constructive step forward toward assuring long-term security for the 
families of America, Israel, and Palestine.

  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time until the 
ranking member has closed.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is 
remaining.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 7\3/4\ 
minutes remaining.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  Mr. Speaker, I have said from the beginning that today this debate is 
a cynical, partisan exercise by my Republican colleagues to attack the 
Biden administration and advance their political agenda.
  Mr. Speaker, I have been here for 26 years, and any time Israel came 
up previously, we didn't play politics with it. We tried to sit down 
and work it out and come out unified, Democrats and Republicans. 
Especially in any foreign policies, one of the things we have done, 
especially on this committee, is try to work together so that the other 
countries of the world did not see a divided America but rather a 
unified America with our allies.
  This is true with, for example, Ukraine. After many of my colleagues 
talked about the delay that took place to pass the supplemental, the 
whole idea even then was to negotiate together to try to come out with 
a bill that showed unity; not play politics with it; not try to say, as 
we have heard in this debate by some on their side: Oh, the Democrats 
are in cahoots with the terrorists.
  That is not who we are. That is not who we should be. We should be 
the United States Congress talking and working. We are not going to 
always agree on everything, but to have dialogue and conversation on an 
issue in a matter that is so serious as this, as we did, as Mr. McCaul 
said correctly.
  On October 8, we wanted to make sure that we put a resolution on this 
floor that over 400 Members of the House of Representatives, Democrats 
and Republicans, could support. We didn't start out agreeing on 
everything in that resolution. We sat down, and we worked and debated. 
We went back and forth, and then we came up with a resolution that we 
could proudly put on the floor to say that the United States Congress 
is together, that we are not divided.
  Mr. Speaker, that is not this bill. We didn't do that on this bill. 
We didn't even try. Why? Politics--politics in such a crucial time as 
this, with all that is going on.
  We were together and made sure that we were working together. We were 
talking to our Arab colleagues about normalization with Israel. Why? It 
is because that makes for a better Middle East. It is good for Israel. 
It is good for our allies in the region. It is good for the United 
States of America.
  That is not what this bill is all about. This bill is not good for 
Israel, and it is not good for our allies in the region. Chairman 
McCaul is correct when he said that we want to make sure that Saudi 
Arabia plays and has normalization with Israel as well as others in the 
Gulf area.
  Speak to them and ask them if this bill will make the area better. 
Speak to them and include them in that dialogue. Because if we want a 
better Middle East, peace for Israel, and the Jewish state to move 
forward where they don't have to worry about a threat, we need to work 
together, not alone.
  That is the dialogue and conversation we should be having. That is 
who we should be as leaders. That is who we should be as the 
indispensable nation. Those are our values.
  We should value every human life. We should be concerned when we see 
people starving, innocent individuals. That shows who we are. That is 
leadership. That brings people together. That is good for Israel, and 
that is good for the United States of America, not this.
  People are watching all over the world. Who are we? Are we just going 
to continue to divide? Are we going to be a nation divided? We can't 
sit down to talk and work things out? I know we can. Mr. McCaul and I 
do it all the time.
  We are having a markup right now, 14 bills in the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee. We didn't start out agreeing, but we worked it out. 
We have 14 bills today, all of them bipartisan. That is who we are. 
That is who we should be.
  You heard Mr. Sherman say he is working now on another bill that we 
can work on together. That is who we are. That is who we should be.
  Let's make a difference. Let's not play politics on the House floor. 
Let's make a difference. We can do this. We are better than this. We 
are better than this.
  I saw today on our committee--and I am proud of this committee--
Democrats and Republicans talking back and forth on their differences, 
trying to figure out how we can change this and move so that we can 
pass a bill in the committee. I was listening as we were doing certain 
things, and truthfully, it made me proud to see how we were working 
together.
  I say to my colleagues on the other side: Let's not do this. We are 
better than this, especially on foreign affairs. I mean, we are going 
to have our political domestic issues, but not on foreign affairs. 
Let's not play politics here. There is too much at stake, just too much 
at stake for us, for others.
  They expect more from us. Let's give them more. Let's show them we 
can work together. Let's show them why we are the greatest country that 
this planet has ever seen. We are the United States of America.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  First, let me just say in response that I also appreciate our 
friendship, our partnership, Mr. Meeks and myself. We are very proud of 
our committee and our committee's record of working in a very 
bipartisan manner.
  Mr. Speaker, following the Holocaust, the world said: Never again.
  Following the massacre on October 7, this body, through our 
bipartisan resolution, said: Never again. When we said that, I thought 
we meant that.

  When President Biden said to Israel after the attacks, ``As long as 
the United States stands . . . we will not let you ever be alone,'' I 
thought he meant that.
  Now, in their moment of need, this administration has turned their 
backs on Israel, halting shipments of weapons they desperately need to 
win. This administration has sowed the seeds of doubt on this Nation's 
commitments to our allies.

[[Page H3294]]

  We abandoned Afghanistan to the Taliban.
  We slow-walked weapons to Ukraine, giving them just enough to bleed 
out but not to win.
  President Biden's decision to withhold weapons, approved by myself, 
the chairman, and the ranking member, and appropriated by Congress, 
defied congressional intent and is tantamount to an arms embargo.
  Mr. Speaker, red lines are meant for our enemies. Red lines are not 
meant for our allies and our friends, but that is precisely what this 
administration is doing to Israel.
  What a terrible message to send to our allies. Even more dangerous is 
the message that we are sending to our adversaries.
  This week marked the 76th anniversary of Israel's independence. Think 
about that and the timing of this. To mark this occasion, the State 
Department released a statement saying: ``The United States was the 
first country to recognize Israeli statehood when Israel declared 
independence in 1948. Our history of shared democratic values, trade, 
deep cultural ties, and commitment to regional security has provided 
the basis for our countries' strong partnership and friendship.''
  A strong partnership and commitment to regional security means 
standing with our allies, not withholding vital weapons during an 
unprecedented war and not withholding vital weapons after Iran, for 
God's sake, for the first time in the history of the State of Israel, 
fired endless rockets from Iran directly into Israel.
  We all want peace and stability in the region, but that cannot happen 
as long as Hamas remains in power.
  Israel remains under attack, and as their closest ally and partner, 
we must give them the tools they need to finish the job. The time is 
now. We cannot wait any longer. It has been delayed enough.
  Only until that final military objective is completed can we begin 
the other phase of this that Mr. Meeks and I have been looking forward 
to, and that is working with the Saudis and Israelis on a security 
agreement, along with the other Arab nations, to finally just maybe 
bring peace and prosperity to a part of the world that has been at war 
for so many years, for way too long.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure and to 
stand with Israel in its darkest hour. I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 8369, 
the Israel Security Assistance Support Act.
  It is deeply disappointing to see the Republican majority continue to 
play politics with America's national security. For over a year, 
Republicans refused to work in good faith with Democrats on bipartisan 
solutions to fund the federal government, including the Department of 
Defense, and support our Ukrainian allies in their fight against 
Putin's illegal invasion of their nation. Now, Republicans are using 
assistance to Israel to attack President Biden, and place unprecedented 
restrictions on the administration's ability to implement American 
foreign policy.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to make it very clear that I believe the Hamas 
terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023, were a barbaric and heinous act 
that cannot ever be excused. I condemned the attacks when they took 
place, and I continue to condemn them. I also believe that Israel has 
the right to self-defense, and I have always supported defensive 
security assistance to Israel, like Iron Dome.
  But as a democracy, Israel, just like the United States, has a 
certain responsibility to its people and to the world to ensure the 
protection of civilian lives by defending itself in a proportionate 
manner. As a Member of Congress, I have been consistent in this belief 
my entire career, and I hold Israel to the same standard that I hold 
the United States to when we use military force. When I have felt that 
American administrations have failed to live up to this standard, I 
have said so publicly. That includes former President Trump's decision 
to use excessive force in Syria which resulted in the unnecessary 
deaths of civilians in American airstrikes. Unfortunately, the last 
seven months have shown that Prime Minister Netanyahu's government has 
pursued a grossly disproportionate use of force in Gaza as a response 
to the Hamas terrorist attacks.
  The United Nations now believes that the death toll in Gaza has 
reached over 35,000 people, many of them women and children. The 
Israeli government has deliberately used large ordinance to destroy 
critical infrastructure in Gaza like hospitals and schools. 
Humanitarian assistance has been repeatedly stalled, and Northern Gaza 
faces catastrophic levels of malnutrition. Now it appears that Prime 
Minister Netanyahu intends to launch a broad military offensive into 
the city of Rafah, where over a million Palestinian civilians are 
sheltering. The results would be catastrophic.
  The level of death and destruction that Prime Minister Netanyahu has 
inflicted on Gaza is shocking, has made Israel less safe, and must end 
immediately. That is why I have called for a regional ceasefire since 
October of last year. I commend President Biden and his national 
security team for working with partners in the region to try to secure 
a ceasefire. I also support President Biden's recent decision to pause 
shipments of certain types of offensive weaponry to Israel as a way of 
preventing further catastrophic loss of life in Gaza, particularly in 
Rafah. And let's be clear, the President's actions to withhold some 
security assistance are entirely consistent with U.S. law. They are 
also consistent with the actions of previous Republican 
administrations, including those led by Ronald Reagan and George H.W. 
Bush. Both these Republican administrations withheld and conditioned 
certain military assistance to Israel to affect a change in Israeli 
policy when it was misaligned with the foreign policy goals of the 
United States. This history speaks to why the legislation before us 
today is so dangerous.
  H.R. 8369 would eliminate all control and oversight that the 
administration has over the flow of taxpayer funded weapons, including 
highly destructive offensive weapons like 2,000- and 500-pound dumb 
bombs, to Israel. This legislation would force the delivery of these 
types of weapons to Israel within 15 days of being signed into law, and 
it would inextricably tie the administration, and America's foreign 
policy itself, to the way Prime Minister Netanyahu chooses to prosecute 
Israel's military campaign in Gaza. If Republicans had their way and 
this bill were to be enacted, the Government of Israel would set 
America's foreign policy instead of our own President and his 
administration. The precedent this would create is dangerous. The only 
Nation that should decide where and how the American taxpayer's dollars 
are utilized is the United States of America. Full stop.
  As if H.R. 8369 were not bad enough, the legislation contains 
provisions that would withhold funding for portions of the budgets for 
the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the National 
Security Council until all assistance to Israel had been delivered. As 
the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, 
I find the threat to withhold funding for national security agencies 
charged with defending our Nation to be an appalling and shocking 
abdication of the Republican majority's responsibilities to govern our 
Nation in a safe and responsible manner.
  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8369 is one of the worst pieces of legislation 
produced by the 118th Congress, and that is saying something. America's 
foreign policy decisions are ours to make, led by the administration in 
office at the time. Forcing taxpayer dollars to be sent to any other 
nation, while prohibiting the ability of the Executive Branch to 
provide suitable oversight and ensure that those funds are not being 
used in contravention of U.S. law, will make America less secure and 
have tremendous negative consequences.
  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 1227, the previous question is ordered 
on the bill.
  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.
  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was 
read the third time.

announced policy of January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
Grothman) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority 
leader.
  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the House and talk 
about four issues that, per usual, I think have not been adequately 
covered by our mainstream press corps.
  The first issue I would like to deal with is their treatment in their 
public statements by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, which is 
the second

[[Page H3391]]

biggest university in the State of Wisconsin, towards what is going on 
in Israel.
  They, I think in part because of some Palestinian sympathizers who 
set up tents on their campus, felt compelled to make an issue on what 
American foreign policy or at least UWM's foreign policy is.
  To my great concern and great embarrassment, they have decided to, in 
their statement, condemn Israel. Also, in addition, to condemning 
Israel, they called on Israel to begin a cease-fire in the Middle East.
  If you read their statement, Mr. Speaker, it is apparent that there 
is some equivalence between Israel and what could be called Palestine, 
or even treating Palestine in a superior position there. This is 
completely unacceptable, and it is, sadly, something that is seen too 
much on university campuses.
  The thing that makes this uniquely horrible is it is coming from the 
administration. It is bad enough if run-of-the-mill faculty members of 
universities around the country can't figure out the obvious difference 
between right and wrong here. It is particularly disturbing that the 
administration itself has a problem distinguishing that.
  Israel was attacked, and over 1,000 people were killed in the most 
bloodthirsty and callous way possible. Israel responded to this 
declaration of war by trying to, as carefully as possible, get rid of 
the Hamas fighters who had tried to destroy them and recapture hostages 
that at least are claimed to be hidden probably in tunnels beneath the 
Gaza community.
  There is a huge difference between the countries. Israel is a modern 
Western, humane country. It is a country with lots of mosques that has 
a very diverse population. Mr. Speaker, you will notice when the over 
1,000 people were murdered and taken hostage, people from Thailand and 
the Phillipines were in Israel. They are trying to get people from 
Ecuador in Israel. People are coming from all around the globe for an 
opportunity to work in Israel.
  Meanwhile, Gaza, like too many, sadly, Third World countries, is a 
corrupt state in which, despite receiving billions of dollars from 
foreign countries, primarily in Europe, is still stuck in the muck. It 
is a country that has no synagogues in it. There is not the 
appreciation for freedom of religion in Gaza like there is in Israel.
  The people who run Gaza have been corrupt. The leaders have sometimes 
been in Qatar and sometimes been in Turkiye. The ancestors of Yasser 
Arafat, who ran Palestine during much of my life, wound up in Paris. 
The people who get the money here don't even stay in Gaza. It is a 
country, by the way, that would be well-run and would be prosperous. It 
is located on the Mediterranean Sea. It was formerly a place where 
people came to recreate and was a tourist spot. It was a place that 
used to have greenhouses that were left behind by the Jews when they 
had to go back to Israel and were destroyed by the people in Palestine.
  In any event, we have to weigh in as a country and wake up as far as 
what is going on in our universities.
  Why do we have universities?
  Some of the American public will overwhelmingly figure out whom they 
should have sympathy for. Nonetheless, in the University of Wisconsin-
Milwaukee, the administration clearly had more sympathy with Hamas than 
they did with Israel, which is something of great concern.
  Another thing of great concern is when they had to deal with the 
apparent crisis of having tents in their university, they felt 
compelled to negotiate with the squeaky people who sympathized with the 
barbaric Hamas military and didn't even talk to people who have had a 
vested interest and apparently didn't talk to people who had a vested 
interest in looking out for Israel, which, after all, is fighting for 
its existence.
  If Israel would immediately pull out of Gaza, what would happen?
  It would allow the Hamas group to replenish their arms and to regroup 
and to someday attack Israel again 5 years, 10 years, 15 years down the 
line.
  So, in any event, I realize the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is 
not as well-known academically as Harvard or MIT or Northwestern or 
some of these other universities that embarrass themselves, but I hope 
the public is paying attention to what is going on in the University of 
Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
  I hope the taxpayers are paying attention, and I hope the chancellor 
who has made some admission that what he did was maybe not right, would 
take a bolder stance and say that his university is not going to weigh 
in or give any sympathy towards Hamas, particularly so soon after they 
so barbarically killed over 1,000 Israelis.
  My second issue today is that within the last few weeks, we received, 
one more time, the monthly totals on the number of migrants who came 
across our southern border. One more time, it is true almost as far 
back as you can find, the numbers for April were a substantial increase 
over last April and a huge increase over the final April under Donald 
Trump.
  During the final April under Donald Trump, April 2020, about 6,000 
people crossed the border. Last April about 178,000 people crossed the 
border. We are now at 204,000. So it has been a huge increase, from 
178,000 to 204,000 people. This is obviously unacceptable.
  That increase is understated because what President Biden has done to 
hold down the numbers is he gives parole to people who are coming here 
from Cuba and Haiti, which probably would add another 30,000 people to 
this list, except for it is not included on the numbers released. So 
the American public and the American press should keep paying attention 
to what is going on at the border.
  The biggest problem in our country, if our country goes under, our 
great country, I think is we anticipate a free press, but to have a 
free press and have it count for something, it has to be a competent 
press. When the numbers were released a couple weeks ago, I think it 
was within the last week, on the number of people who crossed the 
border from April, it should have been a banner headline in every 
newspaper in this country.

                              {time}  1930

  Every 10 o'clock news station around the country should have led with 
the story that we had another all-time record for an April as far as 
people coming across the southern border--instead, nothing. They should 
have pointed out that, one more time, we have just shy of 6,000 
unaccompanied minors.
  There was a time when the press corps cared a little bit about 
breaking apart families.
  Now, when a 16- or 15-year-old shows up at the southern border, what 
does our administration do? Nothing. For all we know, that child is 
never going to see his parents again. Who knows what his motive is for 
showing up at the border, but nothing is done. Our administration is 
settling in where we expect if a young person crosses the border 
without their parents, we will find them a sponsor, and they will stay 
here.
  Quite frankly, what our administration ought to be doing is, even if 
a child shows up at the border with one parent--in this country, in a 
divorce case, we will frequently try to keep both parents in touch with 
the child. So, at the southern border, even if a child shows up with 
one parent, they ought to be turned around unless we can document where 
the other parent is and that they are signing off on this situation.
  Again, I strongly encourage the press corps to pay more attention to 
the border.
  By the way, I want to make one more statement with regard to the 
situation with Israel. There are people who are horrified--and it is 
horrific--when people die in this war. The war could be ended by Hamas 
at any time. At any time, they could say they surrender, here are their 
arms, here are where you are going to find the tunnels, here are where 
the hostages are held. The war would be over tomorrow.
  People do die in the explosions and bombings that take place there. I 
think that there should be a little more attention paid by the 
protesters before they condemn Israel to see how this country reacted 
when we felt it was necessary to bomb population centers when war was 
declared on the United States during World War II.
  I suggest sympathizers with Hamas look a little bit at the Dresden 
firebombings and the bombings in

[[Page H3392]]

Tokyo. That was before we got to the nuclear bombings in Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki. Even with traditional bombs in Dresden and Tokyo, you will 
find, I think, more horrific things happened than anything that is 
happening near Hamas. Not to mention, the Israelis had been incredibly 
careful--much more careful than we were in Tokyo and Dresden--about 
warning civilians and trying to keep them out of harm's way.
  If anybody in this body wants more sympathy or wants to condemn 
Israel, I suggest they look at how we handled the situation when we 
were bombing Japan and Germany toward the end of World War II--by the 
way, at a time when the conclusion of the war was, to a certain extent, 
already determined.
  The third issue that I believe has not been adequately addressed in 
the paper--and when I get back on the weekends, I try to talk to people 
about it; they have no clue--is the fact that we have recently begun 
collecting information regarding Middle Eastern people and people from 
North Africa for a variety of purposes.
  I think people believe that by keeping track of these people, we will 
eventually give them the benefits of affirmative action-type programs 
or diversity sort of programs. Prior to this, which was only approved 
in the last few weeks, we gave potential preferences to Hispanic 
Americans, African Americans, Native Americans, Asians--quite frankly, 
we give preferences whether you are American or not, just Asians who 
are here--and Pacific Islanders.
  The Biden administration, the most divisive administration in this 
country's history, felt that wasn't enough. I think even without 
showing a need, they have decided to add Middle Eastern and North 
African people to the mix.
  If you look at a map of the world, right now, Pakistanis already have 
potential preference, but that ends at the Pakistan-Iran border.
  What they have done is taken anybody who lives between the Pakistan-
Iran border over to the Atlantic Ocean, over to Morocco, and said they 
have the potential for preferences.
  My guess is it would mean that, right now, if you come here and open 
a business, and your ancestry is from these countries, you would, 
therefore, for example, get preferences in government contracting. You 
may get preferences for the purpose of government hiring. You may get 
preferences for government bidding.
  In any event, I think there should have been a lot of discussion in 
the news media before we added another huge bloc of people who, as a 
practical matter, were going to get preferences over the native-born.
  Making this decision even more bizarre, I think the two rationales 
for affirmative action--neither of which I agree with, by the way--were 
either because something bad happened to people in this country maybe 
100 years ago or that this group maybe statistically was not doing as 
well when measured by economic metrics.
  Here, people from the Middle East and North Africa largely have not 
immigrated to this country until the last 30 or 40 years, so you 
couldn't say that there has been historical discrimination here. Not 
only that, at least with regard to people from Iran, they are doing 
much better than the native-born.
  If people from Iran who are doing a great job in this country and 
adding a lot to the United States are making more money than the 
native-born, why would the government go out of its way to say they are 
going to get preferences for government contracting?
  Even more bizarre, like all preferences under these programs, is they 
don't care how wealthy you are. I can be here. We will say I am from 
Morocco. If I inherited $10 million from my parents, I still would be 
helped or given a preference because of my ethnicity, despite the fact 
that I am wildly wealthy. It doesn't really make any sense.
  You self-identify, so you could have somebody who is three quarters 
Irish and one quarter Moroccan, and they would be able to identify as 
North African and get preferences.

  The biggest problem is that it continues the Biden policy of trying 
to create division in Americans. They want people to view themselves 
forever as not just an American, as we did when I was a child, but for 
forever as: I am Hispanic American. I am an Asian American. I am picked 
on.
  This is a way to, I believe, destroy America. I think that is why the 
Biden administration is going down this path.
  I do think, coming back to the mainstream media, we should ask 
ourselves why I have a hard time finding anybody back in my district 
who is aware that we have recently given preferences to this whole new 
body of people, which is a significant policy change. If we had a 
competent press corps in this country, it is something everybody would 
be aware of, and we would have had a public discussion about.
  The final topic, which I don't think has been discussed enough, is 
the goal to have two-thirds of our vehicles be electric vehicles by 
2032.
  I recently bought a car, a Ford Escape, and it occurs to me now that 
it is not impossible that this will be the final normal car I will ever 
own.
  There are a lot of things that can be said about electric cars, but 
almost all of them are bad. My major concern--though there are others, 
as well--is that they are more expensive. When I talk to my insurance 
agent, he tells me the cost of auto insurance with an electric car 
could easily be up more than 50 percent. There are other sources who 
don't say it will be that high, but I think everybody would agree it 
will be at least a 20 or 30 percent increase in the cost of auto 
insurance.
  This, at a time, where due to the excessive spending of the Biden 
administration, the cost of housing is through the roof and the cost of 
food is through the roof. Well, guess what? The cost of a car is about 
to go up. I am told the cost of a new pickup could go up $20,000 as we 
switch to electric cars. The cost of insurance is going up.
  In addition to that, we have the problems that our infrastructure is 
not even remotely ready for electric vehicles and the problems you are 
going to have in which you are not able to drive as many miles. I 
happen to be from Wisconsin, where the huge problem will be trying to 
get these things charged when it is 10 degrees below outside.
  In any event, it is something for this body to pay attention to and 
to warn our constituents about so they are aware that as they set aside 
money for a new car--I think it is a smart thing to set aside money so 
you don't go into debt--you are going to have to set aside extra money 
if you plan on buying a new car more than 8 years from now. It is just 
one more cost that is going to make it more difficult for young 
Americans to join the middle class and prepare for the American Dream.
  In summary, I mentioned the four issues I wish the press would pay 
attention to.
  In the Wisconsin area, the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee came 
out with a ridiculous press release, which they have tried to modify, 
but nowhere near enough, in which they imply that Israel has to do 
something as far as ending the war in the Middle East, not, apparently, 
Hamas, the brutal people who killed many Israelis a little over half a 
year ago now.
  The second issue to look at is that, one more time, we have a record 
number of people coming here for a month, a record number of people 
coming across the border in April, at a time, by the way, when we are 
hitting in 4-year increments records of people being sworn in as 
immigrants legally. It is not like nobody is coming in here, but I 
think the American public ought to be appalled that, one more time, in 
April 2024, we hit an all-time record for people coming here in April.
  The third issue almost entirely unreported in the mainstream media is 
the fact that we apparently are going to give preferences to people 
from North Africa, Libya, Algeria, whatever, over to the Middle East, 
Syria, Iran, as far as government contracting and probably government 
employment. I don't know if it is something we can undo if we get a 
different President, but it is certainly very divisive.
  With it comes the bureaucracy that will forever tell people from 
North Africa and the Middle East that they should identify not just as 
American but a Middle Eastern American or a North African American.
  Finally, I hope the press, as the clock winds down to 2032, warns 
Americans what they are going to have to expect as far as driving a new 
electric vehicle."

Madam President, last week, on May 14, our friend and 
ally Israel celebrated its 76th Independence Day.
  As we all know, Israel was founded in the wake of the Holocaust to 
give the Jewish people a homeland that would allow them to return to 
their ancestral land that they had been forcibly removed from.
  I am proud--very proud--that the United States was the first country 
to recognize Israel; and since then, we have been steadfast allies that 
support one another through times both prosperous and challenging.
  However, this year's Israeli Independence Day came during a time of 
great turmoil, as Israel battles terrorist forces that have ruthlessly 
waged war against them since October 7.
  We join them as they mourn the loss of over 1,200 Israelis killed in 
that initial attack and pray for the safe return of the hostages still 
kept in captivity by Hamas.
  In an alarming development, this longstanding U.S.-Israel 
relationship is now becoming unnecessarily strained by President 
Biden's quest to appease those in his party who do not support the 
State of Israel, a bastion of democracy and freedom in the Middle East.
  The October 7 attack marks the most horrific attack Israel has 
suffered since its founding and the deadliest day for the Jewish people 
since the Holocaust. So how did we get to this point?
  The common refrain for those opposed to Israel now has been to call 
for cease-fire now. We have seen it all across our college campuses. 
And we saw President Biden clap along to these demands, again, as he 
delivered a commencement address just this past weekend.
  And what is even more mind-boggling is that those who are protesting, 
who are they demanding a cease-fire from? I haven't heard a single 
campus protest group call for Hamas to lay down its arms or call for 
Hamas to release the hostages.
  Why? Why? Because they want Israel to stop fighting, because they 
want Israel to stop defending itself, and because they want Israel to 
lose. We cannot forget the fact that a cease-fire was in place on 
October 7, and that cease-fire was broken by Hamas as they deliberately 
attacked innocent civilians in the most brutal and barbaric ways.
  So let's not forget that some of these communities, the border towns 
in Israel that were attacked by Hamas, were some of the most ardent 
supporters in Israel for the Palestinian people.
  They were some of the biggest advocates for peace. Yet despite the 
reality, here in the United States, our colleges have become embroiled 
in controversy over this and play host to anti-Israel and anti-Semitic 
protests that ultimately stopped Jewish students from attending class 
and even led a rabbi at Columbia University to recommend Jewish 
students return home for their own safety.
  These protesters demand that Israel drop their weapons, yet refuse to 
acknowledge that Hamas is the instigator of the war. But we now know 
what Hamas' entire plan was: to minimize any chance of peace in the 
region, to attack Israel's most peace-promoting citizens in the most 
brutal of fashions, especially, and most dangerously and horrifyingly, 
toward Israeli women.
  To undermine the incredible progress that had been made possible 
through President Trump's Abraham Accords, to stop an emerging 
normalization deal with Saudi Arabia, and to conduct an attack on 
Israel so horrific that Israel had no other choice but to respond.
  In what world would we ever expect a country to be attacked in such a 
brutal fashion and not fight to defend itself? It is important to note 
that the chaos and instability benefits one bad actor above all else, 
and that is the Iranian regime.
  Without Iran's help, both financially and militarily, Hamas would not 
have been able to execute their terrorist attacks on the Israelis. Iran 
has further supported Hamas's efforts by launching over 300 projectiles 
at Israel on April 13. And lest we forget, it was an Iranian-made drone 
that killed three American soldiers in Jordan on January 29.
  We must recognize that the deep ties between Hamas and Iran and their 
common goal of destroying Israel and bringing harm to the United States 
and our citizens. Calls for a cease-fire only embolden Hamas and their 
stated aim to repeat the October 7 attacks a second, third, and fourth 
time. Israel must defend itself, and they must root out the evil that 
is Hamas.
  So earlier this week, we learned that the International Criminal 
Court would seek arrest warrants for leaders of Hamas and Israel for 
war crimes.
  It is simply shocking to me that the ICC would seek to establish a 
delusional level of equivalency between the actions of Israel and the 
actions of Hamas. I have seen the footage of the attacks on Israeli and 
American citizens that occurred on October 7, and it is clear that 
Hamas is the real criminal involved in this conflict.

  Hamas continues to show no regard for its own people, spending 
billions of dollars on over 300 miles of tunnel system, but yet they 
are refusing to allow their Palestinian citizens to shelter there; and 
they continue to use hospitals, schools, places of worship for military 
purposes, knowingly placing citizens in harm's way.
  While Israel was founded on the principle of promoting development 
for the benefit of all of its inhabitants, Hamas's only mission is to 
destroy Israel. The differences between their founding principles, 
their leadership, and their actions could not be any more different. 
And it is abhorrent that the ICC would attempt to argue otherwise.
  In these times of instability, you would hope that the President of 
the United States would display strength. Instead, President Biden has 
decided to play politics by placing a hold on security assistance that 
this Congress most recently approved.
  This is just the latest foreign policy blunder from an administration 
plagued by weakness on the international stage. Shortly after this 
policy of withholding weapons was announced, Hamas steps away from the 
negotiations on the safe return of the hostages.
  It seems like a pretty big coincidence to me. Hamas is still holding 
American hostages captive; although, I wonder how many of these 
hostages are still alive, as we discovered--I think it was last week, 
four bodies were discovered.
  And President Biden should be doing everything within his power to 
bring home those American hostages. Instead, he is publicly withholding 
weapons from our ally and giving their adversary cover.
  When President Biden took office, he pledged ironclad support for 
Israel, but now he is publicly backing down from that promise.
  He is projecting to our allies and our adversaries that the U.S. 
promises' can be subject to political pressure.
  To further underscore the administration's lack of responsibility, my 
EPW committee came across something very disturbing this week in our 
ongoing oversight of President Biden's so-called Inflation Reduction 
Act. You might wonder what EPW or the IRA have to do with Israel in 
their battle against terrorists. But we discovered that the Climate 
Justice Alliance, a group that received $50 million from the Biden 
administration in December, openly denies Israel's right to exist and 
actively supports the horrific actions of Hamas. They even promote 
graphics that glorify the bulldozers used by Hamas on October 7.
  It is despicable that the EPA is sending millions of dollars through 
the IRA to a group that perpetrates hatred and violence under the guise 
of fighting climate change and this administration would allow U.S. 
taxpayers' dollars to fund these anti-Semitic activities.
  There is no doubt that the last 7 months have been an incredibly 
difficult time for the people of Israel and Jewish Americans here at 
home. Never,

[[Page S3827]]

never in my life, never would I have ever expected to hear and see the 
anti-Semitic discourse that I see being conducted on our own land, our 
own American shores, and the violence and intimidation towards the 
Jewish community.
  Together we must condemn the rise of anti-Semitism and make clear 
that this hatred has no home in our country and in our world.
  My Republican colleagues and I will continue to display our 
unwavering support for Israel and push for the assistance that they 
need to ensure their survival and victory in this fight, as allies do 
have needs, particularly in this time of need.
  So with that, I yield the floor to my friend from North Dakota, 
Senator Hoeven.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.
  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague from 
West Virginia and others who you will be hearing from--next, our 
colleague from Nebraska--in regard to our absolutely ironclad support 
for Israel and why it is so important that we stand and we stand 
strongly with our friend and ally Israel.
  On October 7, Hamas committed appalling atrocities against Jews in 
Southern Israel. I went to Israel one month later to show my support 
for our close ally during this very dark hour, and I am still today 
very proud to stand with Israel.
  But I am very concerned about the Biden administration holding up 
weapons that need to be delivered to Israel. That is why I have 
cosponsored two important pieces of legislation requiring the President 
to expedite delivery of defensive aid to Israel: first, Senator 
Cotton's Israel Security Assistance Support Act and then the assistance 
support act that Senator Cruz put forward as well; that is the Assuring 
Resupply of Munitions Act, or ARM Act.
  Congress has moved decisively to support Israel, and these bills make 
crystal clear--there is no doubt about it--our desire that Israel 
receive our support without hesitation. We said that October 7 can 
never happen again, but if we say ``never again,'' we should mean it. 
If we truly mean ``never again,'' then the only path forward is for 
Israel to win the war--to win the war.
  And that is why it is so important that we give Israel the tools it 
needs to win the war as soon as possible. Destroying Hamas means 
allowing Israel to reestablish security for its people. Destroying 
Hamas also means it can no longer terrorize and repress the people of 
Gaza. If we are concerned about the lives of Jews and Gazans, the 
sooner Hamas is defeated the better. The sooner Hamas is completely 
defeated, the better.
  Putting limits on military assistance only means prolonging a 
conflict that Israel must win, and it means greater loss of life among 
both Israelis and Gazans.
  Delaying or halting military aid also sends the wrong message to both 
our allies and our adversaries. Our allies, like Israel, rightly wonder 
whether U.S. promises will be kept when times get tough. Our 
adversaries, like Hamas and Iran, wonder if they can manipulate us into 
failure. When we hesitate to keep our promises and give our enemies the 
chance to regroup, we incentivize the very behavior that we must 
oppose.
  We have to wipe out terrorism. We have to work with our allies--not 
just Israel but all of our allies--to wipe out terrorism.
  If Hamas survives, it will certainly seize more hostages in the 
future. That is what Hamas does. If Hamas survives, it will keep using 
innocent civilians as shields. Think about that: using innocent 
citizens as their shields. If Hamas survives, it will see October 7 as 
a triumph rather than a disaster.
  The administration may believe that pausing military assistance will 
save lives or limit suffering, but it will only sow the seeds of future 
conflict. There is no substitute--there is no substitute--for victory 
over Hamas.
  Congress has provided the resources to support our ally Israel, and I 
call upon the administration to keep our promises, to act according to 
the will of the American people, and to accept nothing less than the 
complete defeat of Hamas.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.
  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, this weekend, President Biden called 
for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. What the President didn't 
acknowledge is that Israel and Gaza were not in a state of war until 
October 7, when Hamas broke a cease-fire. They stormed Israel's 
borders, and they raped, tortured, and killed innocent civilians.
  Far-left, pro-Hamas activists are painting Hamas as freedom fighters 
that want to liberate their fellow Palestinians. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. Hamas uses innocent civilians--anyone from 
babies to the elderly--as human shields. They shelter themselves in 
schools and in hospitals. They have no regard for human life or 
dignity, not for Israelis and not for Palestinians.
  Members of Hamas film themselves laughing as they maim and murder 
innocent people. They use sexual assault as a weapon of war. These are 
no freedom fighters; they are terrorists.
  We saw a sobering example of that this weekend. The Israeli military 
recovered the bodies of four hostages who were captured, abused, and 
murdered by Hamas. They found them lying in a tunnel in Gaza. These 
included the body of Shani Louk, a young woman Hamas captured at the 
Nova music festival on October 7. She and the other hostages ran from 
the armed terrorists, who were killing people to their left and to 
their right, but Hamas caught up with them. They sexually assaulted and 
maimed Shani before they murdered her.
  This weekend, the Israeli military returned the mutilated body of a 
young daughter to her grieving parents. These are not the deeds of 
freedom fighters. These are the deeds of terrorists.
  There are still over 100 hostages being held in Gaza, many of whom 
are believed to be dead. Eight of those hostages are Americans, three 
of whom are dead as well--three Americans.
  When President Biden calls for a cease-fire--one neither party has 
agreed to yet--he is just calling for Israel to surrender. He is 
emboldening Hamas and abandoning the dozens of people still being 
abused by these terrorists. He is equivocating because of political 
pressure.
  President Biden must stop sacrificing a moral backbone for political 
gain. You don't negotiate with terrorists. Hamas is using hostages as 
political pawns, and no amount of diplomacy is going to change that.
  The Biden administration should not be telling Israel's 
democratically elected government what they must do. Israel must make 
those decisions to protect their people and protect their country.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.
  Mr. RICKETTS. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in 
expressing my complete support for the State of Israel and the war 
against Hamas terrorists.
  There was a cease-fire in place prior to October 7. Hamas broke that 
cease-fire. Hamas attacked Israel and murdered over 1,200 Israelis and 
Americans. They also took hundreds of hostages, including Americans as 
well.
  Hamas is responsible for every death on October 7 and every death 
since that day. They need to surrender. Hamas must surrender.
  If Hamas surrenders and releases the hostages, aid can freely flow 
into Gaza to support the Gazans. Instead, Hamas continues to prosecute 
this war. In fact, after October 7, they said they would continue to do 
atrocities like October 7, if given the chance. They will continue to 
try to destroy Israel. They will continue to murder Israeli citizens.
  They just don't chant ``Death to Israel.'' They chant ``Death to 
America'' as well.
  Terror groups like Hamas and Hezbollah represent an existential 
threat to Israel. They have repeatedly declared their intention to wipe 
Israel off the map.
  Israel has the right and the obligation to destroy the terrorist 
group Hamas. They must have the ability to defend themselves. And they 
will be doing the world a favor by destroying Hamas.
  We need to support Israel and their efforts to do just that. Part of 
that support means pushing back on anti-Semitic organizations, like the 
United

Nations or the International Criminal Court, that attack Israel's 
legitimacy and their sovereignty.
  The International Criminal Court's ludicrous decision to apply for 
arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and 
Israel's defense chief is the most recent example of their anti-
Semitism. This outrageous decision not only emboldens terrorists around 
the world but creates problems for us here in the United States as 
well.
  In the statement, the ICC prosecutor describes crimes that have been 
committed on ``the territory of Israel and the State of Palestine.'' 
That is exactly backward. He should have said ``the State of Israel and 
the territories of Palestine.'' But that was intentional.
  It is a continuation of the rampant anti-Semitism in these 
organizations, like the ICC and the U.N. It is designed to delegitimize 
the State of Israel.
  And the crazy thing is, the ICC's action, in itself, is illegitimate. 
It lacks legal basis. Under its own charter, the ICC is banned from 
moving forward with prosecutions unless the relevant government is 
unwilling or unable to police themselves.
  The ICC knows Israel has a robust and independent judiciary. The ICC 
knows and has admitted that Israel has trained lawyers who advise 
commanders and a robust system intended to ensure compliance with 
international humanitarian law. By moving forward with these arrest 
warrants, the ICC is calling Israel's laws, government, and democracy 
illegitimate. It is wrong.
  There is no moral equivalency between the State of Israel, democracy, 
and the terrorist organization Hamas. There is no moral equivalency 
between Hamas's terrorist actions and atrocities on October 7 and 
Israel's right to defend itself and to take action to destroy that 
terrorist organization.
  Hamas terrorists have shot unarmed civilians, dismembered soldiers, 
raped women, and massacred children. Meanwhile, Israel has fought its 
war while taking great pains to avoid unnecessary civilian casualties.
  We need to be supporting Israel in its mission, not undermining the 
Israeli Government. It is in our interest to do so.
  Neither Israel nor the United States are members of the ICC. Both 
countries are outside of the ICC's jurisdiction. Yet the ICC is going 
after Israel anyway. America should take note. If the ICC can violate 
Israel's sovereignty, it can violate America's sovereignty.
  The ICC needs to face the consequences of its anti-Israel policies. 
While it is good that President Biden has condemned the arrest warrants 
as ``outrageous,'' Israel needs more than words. It needs actions.
  Last month, my Republican colleagues and I sent a letter to the ICC 
with a warning: If the ICC moved forward with arrest warrants for 
Israelis, we would push to end all American support for this 
disgraceful organization.
  We are here today to tell President Biden one simple thing: If your 
commitment to Israel is really ironclad, as you say, you will join us 
in holding these anti-Semitic organizations accountable. Let's sanction 
the ICC's employees and associates and prevent them from coming to the 
United States. Let's work with our allies to ensure that they refuse to 
honor the ICC's indictments against either Israel or the United States. 
Let's truly demonstrate our ironclad support and stand with our ally 
Israel in its hour of need.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.
  Mr. BUDD. Today is the 229th day of captivity for eight American 
citizens held hostage in Gaza by the terrorist organization Hamas--229 
days of being deprived of food, water, and medical care; 229 days of 
being subjected to unbearable violence, abuse, and psychological 
torture by Hamas terrorists; 229 days that mothers and fathers--many of 
whom I have met--and husbands and wives and brothers and sisters have 
had to live with the pain, the anguish, and the uncertainty of their 
loved ones' well-being. But if you flip on mainstream media tonight or 
if you watch the protests on college campuses or if you listen to the 
Biden White House, the conversation has been dominated by everything 
but securing the release of American hostages.
  We have seen the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court seek 
arrest warrants of Israeli leaders as well as Hamas leaders. Equating 
the Israeli Prime Minister with Hamas terrorists is despicable, and it 
shows a complete lack of moral clarity.
  We have read about the State of Qatar reportedly temporarily 
expelling Hamas leaders from Doha, only to reverse course and welcome 
them back later. To be clear, Qatar is hosting a brutal terrorist 
organization with American blood on their hands. This continued 
dithering and flip-flopping is not helping. Qatar must pressure Hamas 
leaders to release the hostages now or expel them from Doha. It is just 
that simple. To do anything less, my friends, is unbecoming of a major 
non-NATO ally.
  When we look to the President of the United States, we continue to 
see weakness and a lack of moral clarity on this issue. In a total 
betrayal of our friend and ally, the Biden administration withheld 
lethal aid to Israel earlier this month. This signaled to Hamas that 
they can drag their feet and hold out because the so-called ironclad 
bond between the United States and Israel, in Biden's mind, is not so 
ironclad after all.
  I know firsthand that Biden is overruling his national security team, 
and he is letting a few radical activists on his staff dictate foreign 
policy as American lives hang in the balance. At the end of day, there 
is nothing more important in U.S. foreign policy than protecting 
American citizens. The best way we can bring the hostages home from 
Gaza is by increasing pressure on Hamas.
  On the international stage, we need global bodies, like the ICC and 
the U.N., to grow a moral core, identify the evil being committed, and 
to rally the community of nations to pressure Hamas to release innocent 
hostages. We need the State of Qatar to end its straddling and 
doublespeak and to permanently expel Hamas leaders from Doha. Here at 
home, we need the Justice Department to file charges and hunt down 
every Hamas terrorist responsible for the murder of over 40 Americans 
on October 7 and the kidnapping of 8 who remain in captivity. We need 
the President of the United States to show strength and to show some 
moral leadership on this issue.
  Friends, the line between good and evil in this conflict is crystal 
clear. President Biden needs to use every lever of national power to 
secure the hostages' freedom.
  After 229 days, let's be united in working for the release of these 
eight hostages.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Rosen). The Senator from South Carolina.
  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, to kind of continue on the theme of my 
good friend from North Carolina, apparently today or yesterday, the 
countries of Ireland, Spain, and Norway recognized a Palestinian State.
  Here is my question: Who is in charge of the state? Who is running 
the place? What are its boundaries? Did you recognize Hamas being in 
charge of Gaza? Do you want to keep the PA as we know it now in the 
West Bank, as old and corrupt? What did you recognize?
  These are allies, but they need to hear from a friend that what you 
did is reprehensible. You are rewarding terrorists.
  On October 7, Hamas attacked the State of Israel and murdered 1,200 
innocent people, put babies in ovens, raped women, set people on fire, 
and recorded it all. And your response is to create a Palestinian 
State? You are rewarding terrorists. The way a Palestinian State will 
be created, if ever, is through direct negotiations between the State 
of Israel and Palestinians, not a unilateral recognition of a 
Palestinian State after the largest terrorist attack against the Jewish 
people since the Holocaust.
  To my friends in Ireland, Spain, and Norway, what you did was reward 
Hamas. Here is the message you are sending: Kill Jews, and you will get 
a reward.
  Again, tell me about the state you just recognized. Who is in charge, 
and what are the boundaries? You can't answer those questions, but you 
went ahead and recognized the Palestinian State for political reasons.
  The world has turned upside down.
  Madam President, you have been a stalwart defender of Israel, and we 
appreciate it.

[[Page S3829]]

  Here is what I would say: After October 7, Hamas is engaged in using 
the Palestinian people as human shields at a level I haven't seen in 
warfare. The response is to punish Israel, who is in a no-win 
situation. The battalions have to be destroyed. The tunnels are 
underground. Why do you need a 2,000-pound bomb? Because there are 
underground tunnels that only a major bomb will be able to destroy.

  When it comes to civilian infrastructure, the destruction of it has 
been in large part because Hamas has used schools, mosques, and 
hospitals as military sites, putting all that infrastructure in 
jeopardy by militarizing it.
  On top of all of that, the International Criminal Court has decided 
to issue an arrest warrant for the Prime Minister of Israel and the 
Defense Minister of Israel as well as Hamas leaders. Boy, has the world 
turned upside down.
  To consider Israel like Russia--Putin had an arrest warrant issued 
because there is no rule of law in Russia. People fall out of windows 
who are opposition leaders. People get poisoned. There is no rule of 
law in Russia.
  There is a robust legal system in Israel. It is probably the pride of 
the world. The most independent judiciary maybe on the planet lives and 
resides in Israel.
  So Israel is not Russia, and the Prime Minister and the Defense 
Minister of Israel are not Hamas, but in the ICC world, they are all 
the same. That is despicable.
  Here is what has happened: Apparently, a lot of legal experts, some 
well-known, famous people, advised the ICC that Israel needed to be 
charged--the State of Israel, the Prime Minister and the Defense 
Minister. They are legal experts under international law. I would not 
pay these people 5 cents given my undersigning of their own statute.
  I, along with seven members--four Republicans and four Democrats--
engaged the ICC weeks ago, arguing that for you to bring a charge 
against the State of Israel, you would have to believe that the 
judiciary in Israel is not independent and that Israel is not acting in 
good faith--they are acting in bad faith--when it comes to allegations 
against Israeli forces and policies of Israel. It is called 
complementarity.
  Israel is not a member of the ICC, nor are we. In 2015, the ICC 
recognized the Palestinians as a state for ICC purposes even though 
they are not recognized by the U.N. Why they did that, I don't know. 
But they took over jurisdiction of this conflict, and where do we lie 
now?
  On May 20, a couple of days ago, a representative of the ICC was 
supposed to land in Israel to set up a meeting between legal officials, 
government officials of the State of Israel and the prosecutor, Khan, 
next week.
  The group that I was involved in urged the ICC to sit down and talk 
with Israel--called complementarity.
  Under their own statute, the ICC cannot act unless the nation in 
question is unable or unwilling to proceed with an investigation or if 
the investigation is conducted in bad faith. There is no way you can 
find Israel is not acting in good faith when they were willing to meet 
you 2 days ago.
  So here is what happened: We were misled and lied to by the ICC.
  This group thinks they have jurisdiction of the entire world; they 
are going to roam the globe and right wrongs. They were created to deal 
with voids where there is no rule of law or rogue states like Russia, 
where the rule of law has been destroyed, not come and second-guess 
robust democracies like Israel and the United States.
  They threatened to come after our soldiers in Afghanistan years ago, 
and Senator Ernst, who was a member of the U.S. Army serving abroad. We 
objected to high heaven.
  We have a very robust military legal system. We have a very 
independent judiciary. Israel has the most independent judiciary on the 
planet.
  So they canceled the meeting. Israel called and said: When will you 
get here? The man in question for the ICC said: I have been told I 
can't come. And Israel heard about the arrest warrant on CNN. They had 
prerecorded this interview--Mr. Khan had--with a CNN reporter before 
the meeting.
  Senator Cardin has been awesome on this.
  We are trying to get Israel to engage with the ICC, listen to their 
complaints, and see if we can move forward. They acted in bad faith. A 
meeting was set up, the man did not attend, and before Israel knew 
anything, they heard it on CNN.
  So I am hoping that we can come together--and I want to applaud 
President Biden, Secretary of State Blinken, and Jake Sullivan for 
issuing strong statements condemning the actions of the ICC against the 
State of Israel.
  Now it is time to impose sanctions not only to help our ally but also 
to help ourselves. I want everybody to know that if you deal with the 
ICC in this sham trial against Israel, you will never come to this 
country. Your visa will be revoked, and if you have assets here, they 
will be lost. You have to pick what I think is an abuse of the rule of 
law over doing business with America.
  If we don't do that as a body, we are next. I have tried for months 
to find a way forward with my colleagues, who have been terrific, 
trying to find a way for Saudi and Israel to recognize each other, come 
up with a better deal for the Palestinians, to end this conflict in a 
permanent way.
  In the middle of this sensitive moment, the ICC, in a very deceptive 
way, brings charges against the Prime Minister of Israel and the 
Defense Minister, who are in a fight for their lives. They are 
surrounded by Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran.
  Where was the ICC when the Iranians drug a young girl off the bus and 
beat her to death? Where are they in North Korea? They pick Israel--a 
nation with one of the most robust, independent legal systems on the 
planet. They lied to eight U.S. Senators. They cannot get away with 
this. If you let them get away with this, then you are going to regret 
it.
  So I look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats and the 
administration to send a clear signal: We are not going to sit on the 
sidelines while the rule of law is politicized, turned upside down, to 
the detriment of our allies and our own Nation.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.
  Ms. ERNST. Madam President, first, I would like to thank the Senator 
from South Carolina. We know that normalization between Saudi Arabia 
and Israel is incredibly important, and the Senator from South Carolina 
has been knee-deep in efforts to bring those two nations together. I 
would like to thank him first for that.
  America's promises mean something--or at least they should. President 
Biden has repeatedly promised that his commitment to Israel is 
ironclad, but revoking much needed military support for our closest 
Middle Eastern ally says otherwise.
  Let's be clear: The Middle East--really, the entire world--right now 
is on fire, and the blame lies, in large part, on the shoulders of the 
administration. President Biden's weak leadership has consistently 
appeased our enemies and abandoned our allies.
  This dangerous trend began with the disastrous withdrawal from 
Afghanistan, where he left behind Americans and Afghan allies to the 
mercies of Taliban rule. As a result, terrorists across the globe 
rejoice at Biden's decisions instead of trembling in fear of the United 
States as they once did and should.
  Two weeks ago, I returned from Israel, where I advocated for the 
release of American hostages held captive by Iran-backed Hamas. I stood 
before Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, 
and assured them that America has your back. Yet, as my words were 
still reverberating, the Biden administration sent a far different, far 
more damaging message to our ally: We are withholding key munitions.
  Unbelievable and unconscionable.
  Let's not miss that the very weapons that President Biden is 
withholding include kits that will convert bombs into precision-guided 
weapons--tools that would help Israel conduct very precise strikes 
against Hamas, thus reducing civilian casualties.
  Mind you, reducing civilian casualties is the administration's stated 
goal when it comes to how the IDF prosecutes their rightful 
retaliation. Yet the Biden White House is withholding the very means 
Israel needs to accomplish this goal.
  It is total hypocrisy, folks.

[[Page S3830]]

  As Prime Minister Netanyahu said to me and to the world, the United 
States withholding these precision-guided capabilities will not stop 
Israel from defending itself.
  But make no mistake, Biden's decision will make it harder for Israel 
to avoid civilian deaths. This, my friends, is a very, very grim 
reality.
  In April, Congress, with my help, stood firmly with our ally by 
approving critical weapons support for Israel. Leading up to the 
passage of this bill, President Biden himself declared the aid to 
Israel was critical and called for ``swift and decisive action'' to 
ensure Israel had everything it needed to defend itself. Yet, now, when 
it is his time to act, Biden fails to do so.
  Since October 7, Israel has faced existential, Iran-backed threats on 
every side. In the Gaza Strip, Hamas terrorists continue to attack our 
friend and hold dozens of hostages, including Americans--our American 
eight. Hezbollah forces continue to bomb northern Israel, forcing the 
evacuation of 60,000 Israelis. Houthis have also attacked dozens of 
ships crossing the Red Sea in order to strangle the Israeli economy. 
And, of course, Iran--the supporter of all of these terrorist groups--
launched more than 300 projectiles against Israel last month in an 
unprecedented escalation, not to mention the attacks by Iranian proxies 
on our own servicemembers in the region. Three American servicemembers 
were killed at Tower 22 in Jordan. Let's not forget.
  As Israel faces these dangers, we must give her the arms needed to 
fight and win--to destroy the Hamas terrorists that continue to hold 
our--our--fellow citizens hostage, the American eight.
  What must not get lost in all the noise is that the decision to 
withhold weapons from Israel reeks of politics. The President is 
choosing to capitulate to an anti-Israel, pro-Hamas faction within his 
own party. He does so at his own peril and, more importantly, at the 
peril of countless lives.
  President Biden, you have made your choice. You are choosing the side 
of Iran-backed Hamas terrorists who brutally rape women and burn 
children. You are choosing the side of anti-Semites who are ruining the 
lives of Jewish students across this country. You will live with the 
consequences of your choices and, most gravely, so will the American 
hostages and U.S. servicemembers being targeted by Iranian proxies 
every single day.
  Republicans will not waver in our support for Israel and our Jewish 
friends. ``Never again'' is not just a slogan; it is a solemn vow, and 
in this pivotal moment, we will stand on the right side of history.
  I yield the floor."

things. Joe Biden said he was ready to offer all appropriate means to 
support the government and the people of Israel.
  The Acting U.S. Ambassador to Israel said he was sickened by the 
images coming out of southern Israel of dead and wounded civilians at 
the hands of terrorists from Gaza. The White House said it 
unequivocally condemned the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists 
against Israeli civilians.
  Of course, the Office of Palestinian Affairs, defunded by this act, 
called on Israel not to respond militarily to the crimes of rape and 
murder. Aside from that, the U.S. response couldn't have been stronger.

                              {time}  1415

  Fast-forward to June 2024, the Biden administration is withholding 
precision-guided munitions as Israel is facing down an existential 
threat from Hezbollah. The administration and its sycophants in the 
House and the Senate are attempting to undermine Israel's democracy by 
telling the Israeli Government not to defend the Israeli people and 
Israel's security interest.
  Meanwhile, American citizens taken hostage by Hamas on October 7 have 
died in captivity, and this administration's response continues to be 
insufficient, by proposing a cease-fire that is essentially on Hamas' 
terms. Most importantly, it preserves Hamas.
  We have done little to apply pressure on the negotiations, 
particularly Qatar, to use their extensive leverage against Hamas on 
getting Americans back. We have seen the Biden administration cave to 
the demands of student protesters who chant ``kill the Jews'' in 
Arabic.
  There is an old expression in the ``History of the Peloponnesian 
War'' in which it is said that: What men did once in private, they now 
do in public. He spoke of this in the context of the dying Athenian 
morality. I do fear that Hamas' goal of promoting international 
terrorism has emboldened far more public demonstrations of anti-
Semitism.
  We have seen pro-terror activists wielding bear spray while 
preventing Jews from using the entrance to their synagogues in L.A., 
seizing a building and holding custodial staff hostage at Columbia 
University, and other outrages. It is one sign among many of our 
growing societal rot.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Illinois is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Chair, last November, I joined my Democratic 
colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden to urge him to 
designate the Palestinian territories for temporary protected status 
and/or authorize Deferred Enforcement Departure for Palestinians in the 
United States.
  I called on the President to take this action because I knew it would 
save lives, and I applaud the administration for taking this action.
  The administration's policy includes important exemptions, too, such 
as for individuals convicted of felonies or who otherwise pose a public 
safety threat. We know that many civilians remain in danger in Gaza 
after the horrific attacks by Hamas on October 7. The humanitarian 
conditions in Gaza continue to be appalling, and children have been 
disproportionately harmed.
  This amendment is cruel and unjustifiable.
  Furthermore, even if it were adopted, it likely would not accomplish 
anything except creating chaos related to the implementation of a 
policy that involves agencies that are not only in DHS, but also in the 
Departments of State, Justice, and Labor.
  The funds made available by the Department of Homeland Security 
Appropriations Act do not impact USCIS's fee-funded operations, which 
would create confusion even within DHS about how to implement this 
amendment if it were enacted.
  This amendment is nonsensical, and it ignores the realities of how 
our agencies actually work to solve pressing issues. I do not 
understand why we would want to be a Nation that sends civilians into 
dangerous, war-torn conditions to needlessly put their lives at risk.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the 
balance of my time
  Mr. OGLES. Mr. Chair, if this administration supported Israel as much 
as it has worked to preserve Hamas, this war would be over.
  Of course, it doesn't. Rather than signal its support for Hamas' 
extermination and Israel's right to defend itself, Joe Biden now wants 
to keep thousands of Hamas sympathizers in the United States.
  On February 14, 2024, perhaps chosen to demonstrate the 
administration's relative affinity for the so-called Palestinian cause, 
Joe Biden announced he was extending Deferred Enforced Departure for 
Palestinians, allowing up to 6,000 Palestinians to stay in our country 
through August 13, 2025.
  Think about that: Hamas has just been organized, and they attacked, 
and they raped, and they killed, and what does this administration do? 
It defends Hamas. It allows Palestinian sympathizers to stay in our 
country.
  Again, Mr. Chairman, enough is enough. This is the United States of 
America. It is time to secure our border. We get to decide who comes in 
and, by George, we get to decide who has to leave.
  Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes 
appeared to have it.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further 
proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Tennessee 
will be postponed.
; Amendment No. 56 Offered by Mr. Amodei

  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 56 
printed in part C of House Report 118-559.
  Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of Congresswoman 
Stefanik to offer and support amendment No. 56.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the 
     following:
       Sec. __.  The salary of Nejwa Ali, U.S. Citizenship and 
     Immigration Services Adjudication Officer, shall be reduced 
     to $1.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 1316, the gentleman 
from Nevada (Mr. Amodei) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.
  Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment and 
thank the gentlewoman from New York for offering it.
  Our Conference has been quite clear about standing with Israel in 
their fight against a brutal and inhumane terrorist organization that 
not only committed the deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the 
Holocaust but continues to hold innocent men, women, and children as 
hostages.
  I also recognize the Jewish community has been the target of 
increasing anti-Semitism, which was one of the reasons for the 
amendment that we did earlier regarding supplementing FEMA's program 
for protection against bigotry.
  Bigotry has no place in America. It certainly has no place in the 
Department of Homeland Security.
  Nejwa Ali is a DHS immigration adjudication officer. She was exposed 
celebrating the October 7 terrorist attack online. It was later 
revealed that she previously worked for the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, also known as the PLO, which some people would say has a 
troublesome reputation, to put it kindly. Their reputation is in the 
tank when it comes to anti-Semitic policies and things like that.
  During the budget hearing this last April, Secretary Mayorkas 
confirmed for us that she was still employed and on paid administrative 
leave in April, and the Department confirmed to my staff within the 
last 2 weeks that this continues to be the case. This is unacceptable. 
The Department has had more than 8 months to investigate and terminate 
this employee with cause pursuant to the applicable civil service 
regulations.
  While the Secretary and Biden administration refuse to do the right 
thing, I invite the Members of the House of Representatives to 
terminate this employee. We must do the right thing and act with 
urgency to force their hand.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Illinois is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the temptation to take 
congressional action against government individuals when we hear they 
have done something that we find offensive, but as lawmakers, it is 
important that we defend the core principles upon which our country is 
founded, and that includes a system of checks and balances.
  We know from the Secretary's testimony earlier this year that there 
is an active investigation related to Nejwa Ali, a Trump-era hire, and 
that she has been placed on leave and is not performing the duties and 
responsibilities for which she was hired. We must allow this process to 
work.
  Ironically, the bill we are considering today would cut important 
departmental resources that are meant to strengthen its personnel 
security vetting policies and procedures, such as a cut of nearly $14 
million to the Office of the Chief Security Officer.
  It is a shame that, throughout this process, my majority colleagues 
continue to criticize the Department for not doing its job while at the 
same time they propose cutting the resources the Department needs to 
address the very concerns that they continue to raise.
  In addition, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that this 
amendment also raises constitutional issues.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

                              {time}  1500

  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Amodei).
  The amendment was agreed to.

  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read 
the first time.
  General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Appropriations, or their respective 
designees.
  The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart) and the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Lee) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Chair, I also want to apologize, because I am getting over this 
pretty bad cold, and so I hope my voice will stand up for the hours 
that we have here on the floor.
  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to speak on the fiscal year 2025 
Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
appropriations bill for floor consideration here today.
  The bill totals $51.7 billion, which is a cut, a reduction, of $7.6 
billion from the fiscal year 2024 enacted level. That is 11 percent 
less than enacted and nearly 20 percent below the President's budget 
request.
  This allocation and the policies within the bill will allow us to 
build on important changes that House Republicans fought hard to secure 
in the fiscal year 2024 bill signed into law only a few months ago.
  You are probably going to hear it now. There are some who will say 
that cuts of this magnitude jeopardize the United States' leadership in 
the world, that we are abandoning our leadership, and that the world 
will be less safe.
  Let me be very clear. I completely disagree. In fact, it is just the 
opposite.
  The priorities in this bill are crystal clear. If you are a friend or 
an ally of the United States, this bill supports you. If you are an 
adversary or are cozying up to our adversaries, then frankly, no, you 
are not going to like this bill.
  The bill eliminates controversial or ineffective programs that, 
frankly, American taxpayers do not support and that, frankly, again, 
even our allies and partners don't support either.
  This is key: Even with the deep cuts to the top-line spending, this 
bill fully funds our ally Israel and increases funding over the 
President's request to counter Communist China and to combat the flow 
of fentanyl into our country, again while spending less money overall.
  Let me tell you what this bill does not do, what this bill does not 
fund, Mr. Chairman. Despite the Biden administration's request, this 
bill will not fund organizations that employ terrorists, like UNRWA. It 
does not fund organizations that provide a platform on the global stage 
for the worst human rights abusers, like the Human Rights Council, or 
that take bogus legal action against Israel, as it fights for its very 
existence, like the International Criminal Court and the International 
Court of Justice.
  No, this bill does not fund organizations that cower to Communist 
China and deny Taiwan even observer status, like the World Health 
Organization. This bill also does not pay for other countries' climate 
reparations, like the Loss and Damages Fund.
  This bill certainly does not permit funds to promote and mobilize 
illegal migration to the United States' southern border through 
organizations exploiting this administration's dangerous open-border 
policies.
  Yes, this bill stops funding to all of those organizations and 
programs for the reasons that I mentioned, not just because they are a 
waste of money, which would be reason enough, but because those 
organizations are actually working against our interests and those of 
our allies while utilizing American taxpayer money to do so.
  I will take a moment to address how this bill treats, for example, 
the United Nations. This bill acknowledges the mockery that is the 
U.N., unfortunately, and zeros out the U.N. regular budget. The U.N. 
does not deserve one more dime of taxpayer money. It just doesn't.
  The hypocrisy and the moral decay at the U.N. has only gotten worse 
and is rearing its ugly head time and time again with repeated, brazen, 
anti-Semitic attacks against Israel.
  That is why this bill builds on, frankly, key wins from fiscal year 
2024 and adds new conditions on anti-Semitism and anti-Israel bias 
throughout the United Nations and other international organizations. 
This should be no surprise. Actions have consequences. At least they 
should. The U.N. will feel the consequences of their actions in this 
bill.
  This legislation makes confronting the national security threat posed 
by the Communist Chinese Party a top priority. It provides $2.1 billion 
to counter the malign influence of the People's Republic of China and 
the Communist Party of China. Note this: That is above the President's 
request despite spending less money overall.
  It also provides $500 million for foreign military financing for 
Taiwan's

[[Page H4263]]

security needs and prioritizes funding for other critical partners in 
the Indo-Pacific, including the Philippines and the Pacific Island 
countries.
  I would like to now turn to our hemisphere, which is another top 
priority in this bill, which impacts all Americans. This bill includes 
funding to combat the trafficking of opiates, and in particular 
fentanyl, which is killing so many young Americans. This bill also 
holds accountable governments failing to cooperate on countering 
narcotics and other issues of critical importance to the United States 
and the American people.
  Let me give you this example. No funds in this bill can go to Mexico 
until a certification is made that an agreement is in place to restore 
water deliveries owed to the United States from Mexico.
  The bill increases support for freedom and democracy for the people 
of Cuba, in this hemisphere, by providing $35 million for democracy 
funding and $35 million for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. It also 
reins in attempts by the Biden administration to promote the so-called 
entrepreneurs in Cuba's closed, communist economy.
  Let's be very clear. The only truly independent entrepreneurs in Cuba 
are in prison. While the Cuban people are risking their lives to demand 
true freedom and hitting the streets to demand true freedom, 
unfortunately, the Biden administration is attempting to throw their 
oppressors a lifeline with unilateral sanction relief. That is why the 
language is even further tightened this year.

                              {time}  1700

  Finally, this bill includes all longstanding pro-life protections, 
including a prohibition on all taxpayer funds from being used to pay 
for abortion. It builds on those requirements by applying the 
Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy to all global health 
funding.
  You see, Mr. Chairman, it promotes American values by continuing 
important funding for democracy, increasing funding for religious 
freedom programs abroad, supporting faith-based organizations that are 
helping to deliver the United States foreign assistance, and 
eliminating programs that use taxpayer dollars for, frankly, 
controversial or ineffective agendas.
  Now, before I close, Mr. Chairman, if I may, I thank the amazing 
staff from the Appropriations Committee for their work on the bill. 
Also, I thank my personal office staff who have worked amazingly hard 
with very little time, as you know, on this important bill.
  Again, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for bringing this legislation to the 
floor. I am actually thanking the Speaker of the House for bringing 
this legislation to the floor which supports our allies. It protects 
our national security in a smart, efficient, and thoughtful way.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to 
the House Republican draft of the FY25 State, Foreign Operations, and 
Related Agencies appropriations bill.
  This woefully underfunded bill will weaken America, and, yes, it will 
leave us vulnerable to our adversaries.
  The measures Republicans are bringing to the House floor this week 
would slash our diplomatic and development programs by a shocking 12 
percent, while at the same time seeking to increase military spending 
by $8.5 billion.
  These cuts would leave America vastly weakened. This continues a 
dangerous trend that puts the Pentagon on steroids while leaving 
diplomacy and development on life support.
  Our national security is built on three pillars: defense, diplomacy, 
and development. We need all three to be strong to execute a foreign 
policy that advances both our interests and our values. We already 
spend 50 percent less in real terms on diplomacy and development than 
we did 40 years ago. If only defense is adequately funded, it means 
that we will too often rely only on military force, which should be a 
last resort, not our first. In the famous words of General Mattis: If 
you don't fund the State Department, you need to buy me more 
ammunition.
  My Republican colleagues like to talk a good game about confronting 
China. In truth, this bill is really a gift to Beijing's diplomatic 
efforts. Even before the billion-dollar cut to our embassies and 
Foreign Service officers, the People's Republic of China now has more 
foreign missions and more diplomats than we do.
  In addition, the bill's prohibitions on participation in global 
venues like the United Nations or the World Health Organization will 
simply mean that China's self-interest will go unchecked by the United 
States. You can't have it both ways.
  I just returned from a bipartisan delegation to Africa where my 
colleagues and I, both Democrats and Republicans, met with reformers in 
key African democracies. These leaders told us that they preferred to 
partner with the United States over China. However, too often, American 
presence and investment was missing in action.
  They told us over and over and over again: Where are you? You are not 
here.
  Countering the PRC's influence means, quite frankly, America needs to 
show up. Republicans, again, as I said, can't have it both ways. China, 
Russia, and all of our adversaries will rush to fill the void left by 
this bill.
  This bill also takes a really dishonest approach to the existential 
threat posed by climate change. People around the world are confronting 
the impacts of human-caused climate change right now: life-threatening 
temperatures, crop failures, floods and severe weather. Many of us are 
experiencing this in our own districts and hometowns.
  Now, we can't change the temperature. Climate change is here. The 
past 12 months have been the hottest ever measured, but we can help 
people and communities around the world to cope with the most life-
threatening impacts.
  However, this bill ignores reality. It includes no funding for clean 
energy; no funding to help communities adapt to drought, rising 
coastlines, or extreme heat; no funding to stop deforestation or 
recurring coastal flooding; and the bill cuts off, mind you, 
cooperation with other countries.
  Once again, Mr. Chair, think of the PRC and what this bill says to 
them.
  The bill also wages war on women's reproductive freedom. Mr. Chair, 
218 million women still cannot access the tools to decide when and how 
to have a baby. As a result, hundreds of thousands die in childbirth. 
That is a fact. The Republican bill makes it harder for women to access 
care. It also cuts off funding for the United Nations Family Planning 
Association, the one partner that helps mothers and babies in the 
hardest places to reach. Mothers and babies will die because of this.
  Nonetheless, the most damaging aspect of this bill is the massive 
abdication and retreat of United States leadership around the world. 
The bill treats issues and countries as black and white, good and evil; 
it is our way or the highway. This is fundamentally undemocratic for a 
country that stands for democracy.
  A key example is how this bill doubles down and triples down on the 
failed, yes, failed Cuban embargo. There is no track record of success 
nurturing democracy and human rights by punishing regular people.
  Instead of listening to partners and addressing concerns together, 
this bill forces the United States to go it alone and reject any 
country with a different perspective. Perhaps most telling, the largest 
increase in this bill is foreign military financing in the State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. It zeroes 
out the United Nations and outright prohibits half a dozen U.N. bodies. 
The message of this bill, once again, is more weapons and less 
cooperation.

  This is not how the world works. This approach is isolating America. 
Yes, human rights violators and countries that do not share democratic 
values also participate in these organizations, but that is why we must 
stay engaged. If we cede the ground to countries with little regard for 
human rights, then we are enabling more injustice.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and get to work 
on a truly bipartisan approach that will protect and advance America's 
security interests and, of course, make sure that we are a country 
which leads in forming alliances and cooperates for the sake of the 
survivors of our planet.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
; Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks), the distinguished ranking member 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking Member Lee for all the hard 
work that she does on SFOPS and her global leadership, which is 
tremendously important.
  Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to this legislation.
  On this very floor, my Republican colleagues have claimed that 
America is falling behind its competitors like China, that we must 
counter its spreading malign influence that it has commanded through 
foreign investments and other coercive measures.
  While Beijing has increased its diplomatic budget over the last 
decade to surpass even what we afford our own diplomatic posts and 
personnel, what is the Republicans' strategy to grow our own influence 
and to outcompete China, Russia, and other national security 
competitors and adversaries? What is their plan? They propose this 
legislation, a partisan chain saw to our international affairs budget, 
which would impose a 12 percent cut on top of the cuts they imposed in 
last year's budget. This bill is a white flag of surrender in the 
competition for global influence.
  I believe there is still a bipartisan majority in this House that is 
serious about meeting the national security challenges we face. 
Unfortunately, the majority is not being allowed to work its will 
today. Instead, this legislation caters to the fringe MAGA wing of the 
Republican Party with extreme riders on abortion and family planning, 
climate change, and DEI.
  The bill cuts funding to international organizations, including the 
U.N., where we must demonstrate stronger leadership to advance U.S. 
interests.
  This bill has sharp cuts to the personnel accounts for both the State 
Department and USAID. How are we going to implement programming without 
the staffing needed to manage it, or retain the skilled diplomatic 
workforce?
  Amendments proposed today zero out funding for Ukraine, USAID, 
humanitarian and international disaster relief, educational exchange 
programs critical to promoting America's standing around the world, and 
democracy and human rights programs. This is irresponsible 
policymaking.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), a member of the 
Appropriations Committee.
  Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Chair, sadly, I rise in opposition 
to the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act, 2025, with the hope and expectation that we can do 
better.
  Mr. Chair, as the leaders of the free world, we have a duty to ensure 
that this critical bill reflects the importance of American leadership, 
our commitment to developing nations, and our investments in peace and 
democracy around the world.
  While I am very pleased that this bill includes vital provisions for 
our support of Israel and maintains funding for the implementation of 
the Women,

[[Page H4265]]

Peace, and Security Act, it ultimately falls short in too many crucial 
areas.
  My Republican colleagues often emphasize the threats posed by our 
global adversaries. However, this bill fails to recognize that poverty, 
hunger, disease, conflict, hatred, and climate change are also 
formidable enemies.
  So, alarmingly, it severely cuts funding for development assistance, 
humanitarian aid, and democracy programs, eliminating funding for such 
organizations that save lives like UNICEF and UNFPA.
  It slashes support for women's healthcare and family planning 
services and includes dangerous policy riders that prevent the poorest, 
most vulnerable women from accessing abortion, and it shuts down health 
clinics just for providing accurate information.
  Furthermore, this bill fails to appreciate the diversity of mankind. 
It contains provisions that harm the LGBTQ community worldwide and 
stifles diplomatic diversity initiatives.
  Mr. Chair, by ceding American leadership, this bill creates a vacuum 
that will embolden our adversaries, leaving our country and the world 
less healthy, less safe, and less prosperous.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and send a 
clear message that we can do better.
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time.
  Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Ramirez).
  Mrs. RAMIREZ. Mr. Chair, I rise to strongly oppose H.R. 8771.
  The fact that we are even debating this ridiculous bill makes it 
clear that some of my colleagues still remain, I will say, uninformed, 
which will be the kind word, of the ways in which the world is 
interconnected.
  They deny the devastating consequences when our Nation neglects our 
role, defunds diplomacy, and erodes our commitments to the 
international community. The multifront global crises facing this 
Nation calls for leadership and for our Nation's leaders to step up in 
partnership and cooperation.
  Instead, Republicans are doubling down on poison pills that roll back 
our commitments around reproductive healthcare, LGBTQI+ rights, and 
climate change; cut over $1 billion to the United Nations and 
international bodies that hold war criminals accountable; decimate 
lifesaving humanitarian aid and gut migration and refugee assistance; 
and undermine Presidential authority and also international laws.
  That is what this bill is about. This bill, in my opinion, is deeply 
unserious and dangerous, and I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''
  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
; Mr. COLE. Mr. Chair, the United States has long been the global 
leader for peace, stability, and international cooperation. This role 
did not come easily or through weakness. It is the result of the great 
sacrifice of the American people. It came about not only because of our 
armed might, which served to defeat the fascist powers during World War 
2, but also because of America's clear commitment to the values of 
freedom and democracy, not only for ourselves, but for all of humanity.
  Today's measure--the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and 
Related Programs Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2025--reflects that 
persistent commitment to our national values. It also commands American 
excellence--we will not only be a participant in the international 
conversation, but the global leader of it.
  The bill prioritizes programs to protect our national security; 
enhance our working relationships with friends, allies, and partners

[[Page H4266]]

around the globe; and promote freedom and democracy abroad.
  It supports our allies and partners like Israel and Taiwan, both 
democracies that face external threats.
  It includes funding to enhance security partnerships in the Indo-
Pacific region, which is critical to countering Communist China's 
continued aggression.
  And it prioritizes funding for combating fentanyl, a crisis that is 
touching every community in every state in the Nation.
  The bill accomplishes these goals in a fiscally responsible way, 
ensuring that funds are spent where they are needed most. Critically, 
the bill also maintains longstanding bipartisan policies to promote 
religious freedom and to protect life, which are of great importance to 
so many Americans.
  I'm deeply proud of the work we have done on this bill, and I applaud 
Chairman Diaz-Balart for his hard work. I urge all of my colleagues to 
support this bill.
  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.
  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the 5-minute rule.
  An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of 
Rules Committee Print 118-39 shall be considered as adopted and the 
bill, as amended, shall be considered as an original bill for the 
purpose of further amendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be 
considered as read.

     the provisions of chapter 1 of part I and chapters 4 and 6 of 
     part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, may be used, 
     notwithstanding section 660 of that Act, to enhance the 
     effectiveness and accountability of civilian police authority 
     through training and technical assistance in human rights, 
     the rule of law, anti-corruption, strategic planning, and 
     through assistance to foster civilian police roles that 
     support democratic governance, including assistance for 
     programs to prevent conflict, respond to disasters, address 
     gender-based violence, and foster improved police relations 
     with the communities they serve.
       (2) Combat casualty care.--
       (A) Consistent with the objectives of the Foreign 
     Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act, funds

     of this subparagraph shall apply to a country in conflict, 
     unless the Secretary determines that such country has in 
     place, to the maximum extent practicable, functioning combat 
     casualty care treatment and equipment that meets or exceeds 
     the standards recommended by the Committee on Tactical Combat 
     Casualty Care:  Provided further, That any such training and 
     equipment for combat casualty care shall be made available

     assistance with funds appropriated by this Act under section 
     660(b)(6) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, support for 
     a nation emerging from instability may be deemed to mean 
     support for regional, district, municipal, or other sub-
     national entity emerging from instability, as well as a 
     nation emerging from instability.
       (2) Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration.--

     financing to Israel, Egypt, the North Atlantic Treaty 
     Organization (NATO), and major non-NATO allies for the 
     procurement by leasing (including leasing with an option to 
     purchase) of defense articles from United States commercial 
     suppliers, not including Major Defense Equipment (other than 
     helicopters and other types of aircraft having possible 
     civilian application), if the President determines that there 
     are compelling foreign policy or national security reasons 
     for those defense articles being provided by commercial lease 
     rather than by government-to-government sale under such Act.
       (4) Special defense acquisition fund.--Not to exceed 
     $900,000,000 may be obligated pursuant to section 51(c)(2) of

     U.S.C. 2321h(b)) shall not apply to defense articles to be 
     set aside, earmarked, reserved, or intended for use as 
     reserve stocks in stockpiles in the State of Israel.
       (6) Program clarification.--Notwithstanding section 
     503(a)(3) of Public Law 87-195 (22 U.S.C. 2311(a)(3)), the 
     procurement of defense articles and services funded on a non-
     repayable basis under section 23 of the Arms Export Control 
     Act may be priced to include the costs of salaries of members 
     of the Armed Forces of the United States engaged in security 
     assistance activities pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 341 (relating to 
     the State Partnership Program):  Provided, That this

     demining equipment available to the United States Agency for 
     International Development and the Department of State and 
     used in support of the clearance of landmines and unexploded 
     ordnance for humanitarian purposes may be disposed of on a 
     grant basis in foreign countries, subject to such terms and 
     conditions as the Secretary of State may prescribe.
       (B) Cluster munitions.--No military assistance shall be 
     furnished for cluster munitions, no defense export license 
     for cluster munitions may be issued, and no cluster munitions 
     or cluster munitions technology shall be sold or transferred, 
     unless--
       (i) the submunitions of the cluster munitions, after 
     arming, do not result in more than 1 percent unexploded 
     ordnance across the range of intended operational 
     environments, and the agreement applicable to the assistance, 
     transfer, or sale of such cluster munitions or cluster 
     munitions technology specifies that the cluster munitions 
     will only be used against clearly defined military targets 
     and will not be used where civilians are known to be present 
     or in areas normally inhabited by civilians; or
       (ii) such assistance, license, sale, or transfer is for the 
     purpose of demilitarizing or permanently disposing of such 
     cluster munitions.
       (3) Crowd control.--If the Secretary of State has 
     information that a unit of a foreign security force uses

Madam Speaker, there is audio from January 29 of 6-year-
old Palestinian girl, Hind, as she was calling the paramedics, begging 
them to come rescue her after the rest of her family in the car had 
already been killed by the Israeli military. She kept begging: ``Come 
get me. Please come get me. I am so scared. Please come.''
  No one was able to reach the car for 12 days, when her decomposing 
body was found alongside the bodies of five of her family members.
  The bodies of two Palestine Red Crescent Society workers, missing 
since the day of her call when they were dispatched to rescue her, were 
discovered in an ambulance just feet away.
  Madam Speaker, I am here to talk about it because a new forensic 
analysis found that the Israeli military fired not one, not two, not a 
dozen, not 20, but 355 tank bullets at the car that Hind was in, and 
the tank was so close that the Israeli soldiers would have had a clear 
view of Hind in the car.
  Six months later, the State Department and President Biden has yet to 
hold the Israeli Government accountable for these executions."

;SEC. 1292. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.

       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) The Palestine Liberation Organization and the 
     Palestinian Authority provide hundreds of millions of dollars 
     per year in payments, salaries, and benefits to terrorists 
     and the families of terrorists as part of a system 
     compensation that incentivizes, encourages, rewards, and 
     supports acts of terrorism.
       (2) The Palestine Liberation Organization and the 
     Palestinian Authority policies, laws, and regulations that 
     direct, authorize, enact, facilitate, and implement a system 
     of compensation in support of acts of terrorism require 
     payments, salaries, and benefits to terrorists including 
     those who are members and part of organizations designated as 
     foreign terrorist organizations by the Secretary of State 
     under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
     U.S.C. 1189), including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, that receive 
     direct support including financial and military assistance 
     from Iran, the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the 
     world.
       (3) In 2018, Congress passed the Taylor Force Act (title X 
     of division S of Public Law 115-141; 132 Stat. 1143) into law 
     that calls on the Palestine Liberation Organization and the 
     Palestinian Authority to end their system of compensation 
     that incentivizes, encourages, rewards, and supports acts of 
     terrorism and restricts United States assistance ``that 
     directly benefits the Palestinian Authority'' unless the 
     Secretary of State certifies to Congress that the Palestine 
     Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority have 
     met specific conditions including terminating that system of 
     compensation and revoking the policies, laws, and regulations 
     that authorize and implement the system of compensation.
       (4) Despite the enactment of the Taylor Force Act, the 
     Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian 
     Authority have continued their system of compensation that 
     incentivizes, encourages, rewards, and supports acts of 
     terrorism.
       (5) On October 7, 2023, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other 
     Gaza-based terrorist organizations attacked Israel on Shabbat 
     and during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, committing 
     the deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the 
     Holocaust.
       (6) On October 7, 2023, Hamas fired thousands of rockets 
     into Israel, deliberately targeting Israeli civilians, and 
     thousands of terrorists invaded Israeli communities--
     massacring, raping, torturing, decapitating, burning alive, 
     seriously injuring, and kidnapping Israelis and Americans, 
     including men, women, children, babies, and grandparents, and 
     including Holocaust survivors, with children being murdered 
     in front of their parents and parents being murdered in front 
     of their children.
       (7) On October 7, 2023, Hamas murdered more than 1,200 who 
     were mostly civilians, and kidnapped more than 240, including 
     Israeli and American men, women, children, babies, and 
     grandparents, and took them to Gaza as hostages.
       (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the 
     United States to hold the Palestine Liberation Organization 
     and the Palestinian Authority accountable including through 
     the imposition of sanctions for providing payments, salaries, 
     and benefits to terrorists and the families of terrorists as 
     part of a system compensation that incentivizes, encourages, 
     rewards, and supports acts of terrorism.

 Subtitle G--Maintaining Our Ironclad Commitment to Israel's Security 
                                  Act

     SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE.

       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Maintaining Our 
     Ironclad Commitment to Israel's Security Act''.

     SEC. 1292. FINDINGS.

       Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) In 2016, the Obama administration concluded 
     negotiations with Israel for a 10-year memorandum of 
     understanding to provide security assistance to Israel for 
     the period of fiscal years 2019 through 2028 that affirmed 
     ``the unshakeable commitment of the United States to Israel's 
     security''.
       (2) In May 2024, the Biden administration delayed shipment 
     to Israel of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound 
     bombs in an effort to apply political pressure to the 
     Government of Israel. The decision to delay such shipment was 
     made without consulting with or notifying Congress and 
     despite repeated public assurances that the United States-
     Israel relationship was ``ironclad'' and that there was ``no 
     change in policy''.
       (3) On May 8, 2024, President Biden stated, with respect to 
     Israel, ``We're not going to supply the weapons and artillery 
     shells.''.

     SEC. 1293. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       It is the sense of Congress that--
       (1) Israel has a right to defend itself, which includes the 
     need for offensive capabilities to

[[Page S5006]]

     deter and defeat threats, including threats posed by Iran and 
     its terrorist proxies Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis;
       (2) previously negotiated and approved United States arms 
     sales to Israel should proceed, and all pauses should be 
     lifted, to ensure that Israel is properly equipped to defend 
     itself and defeat threats, including threats posed by Iran 
     and its terrorist proxies Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis; 
     and
       (3) limiting or otherwise delaying the sale or delivery of 
     United States-made defense articles to Israel runs counter to 
     the commitments the United States made to Israel as part of 
     the 2016 memorandum of understanding and undermines regional 
     security, including prospective advances in Israel-Saudi 
     normalization.

       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) The Palestine Liberation Organization and the 
     Palestinian Authority provide hundreds of millions of dollars 
     per year in payments, salaries, and benefits to terrorists 
     and the families of terrorists as part of a system 
     compensation that incentivizes, encourages, rewards, and 
     supports acts of terrorism.
       (2) The Palestine Liberation Organization and the 
     Palestinian Authority policies, laws, and regulations that 
     direct, authorize, enact, facilitate, and implement a system 
     of compensation in support of acts of terrorism require 
     payments, salaries, and benefits to terrorists including 
     those who are members and part of organizations designated as 
     foreign terrorist organizations by the Secretary of State 
     under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
     U.S.C. 1189), including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, that receive 
     direct support including financial and military assistance 
     from Iran, the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the 
     world.
       (3) In 2018, Congress passed the Taylor Force Act (title X 
     of division S of Public Law 115-141; 132 Stat. 1143) into law 
     that calls on the Palestine Liberation Organization and the 
     Palestinian Authority to end their system of compensation 
     that incentivizes, encourages, rewards, and supports acts of 
     terrorism and restricts United States assistance ``that 
     directly benefits the Palestinian Authority'' unless the 
     Secretary of State certifies to Congress that the Palestine 
     Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority have 
     met specific conditions including terminating that system of 
     compensation and revoking the policies, laws, and regulations 
     that authorize and implement the system of compensation.
       (4) Despite the enactment of the Taylor Force Act, the 
     Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian 
     Authority have continued their system of compensation that 
     incentivizes, encourages, rewards, and supports acts of 
     terrorism.
       (5) On October 7, 2023, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other 
     Gaza-based terrorist organizations attacked Israel on Shabbat 
     and during the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, committing 
     the deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the 
     Holocaust.
       (6) On October 7, 2023, Hamas fired thousands of rockets 
     into Israel, deliberately targeting Israeli civilians, and 
     thousands of terrorists invaded Israeli communities--
     massacring, raping, torturing, decapitating, burning alive, 
     seriously injuring, and kidnapping Israelis and Americans, 
     including men, women, children, babies, and grandparents, and 
     including Holocaust survivors, with children being murdered 
     in front of their parents and parents being murdered in front 
     of their children.
       (7) On October 7, 2023, Hamas murdered more than 1,200 who 
     were mostly civilians, and kidnapped more than 240, including 
     Israeli and American men, women, children, babies, and 
     grandparents, and took them to Gaza as hostages.
       (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the 
     United States to hold the Palestine Liberation Organization 
     and the Palestinian Authority accountable including through 
     the imposition of sanctions for providing payments, salaries, 
     and benefits to terrorists and the families of terrorists as 
     part of a system compensation that incentivizes, encourages, 
     rewards, and supports acts of terrorism.

Pursuant to House Resolution 1370, the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. Brecheen) and a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.
  Mr. BRECHEEN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits the Department 
of Energy from issuing licenses to export nuclear materials to China, 
closing a loophole that currently allows for the export of some of 
those products.
  Last year, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission rightly suspended the 
general license for export of nuclear material to China. However, this 
action left open the possibility that nuclear exporters could be 
granted a specific license to continue sending nuclear materials to 
China.
  This commonsense amendment is something that should be put forward, 
as no one wants the United States to give one of our greatest 
adversaries access to nuclear materials. For years, the People's 
Republic of China has engaged in a campaign of aggressive economic and 
political competition with the United States. China steals our 
intellectual property; engages in dishonest trade practices; spies on 
U.S. citizens, to include balloons; and constantly attempts to spread 
its influence across the United States.
  China is openly aggressive in the Asia-Pacific region, making clear 
its desire for regional dominance.
  We should never reward this behavior by giving them dangerous nuclear 
materials. We cannot allow these materials with a potential for dual 
use to be sent to our most powerful global adversary. We are engaged in 
competition with them.
  With a People's Republic of China that is not friendly, we cannot 
allow our trade policies to work to the detriment of our national 
security.
  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Oklahoma (Mr. Brecheen).
  The amendment was agreed to.
  The CHAIR. For what purpose does the gentlewoman from Ohio seek 
recognition?
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ms. DeLauro, I move to 
strike the last word.
  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) is recognized for 5 
minutes.
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
Sarbanes).
  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me 
time.
  Mr. Chair, I rise with respect to an amendment that I introduced with 
Congressman Bilirakis that has already been made part of the en bloc, 
which has been agreed to. I am very appreciative of that, but I just 
want to put a very few words on the record.
  Mr. Chair, that amendment would provide funding to the Department of 
Energy's Office of International Affairs to establish the U.S.-Eastern 
Mediterranean Energy Center, a research center for energy innovation 
and collaboration with our eastern Mediterranean allies, Greece, 
Cyprus, and Israel.
  Building off of the success of the U.S.-Israel Energy Center, the 
U.S.-Eastern Mediterranean Energy Center was authorized by the 
bipartisan Eastern Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act of 
2019, which was enacted in appropriations legislation for fiscal year 
2020.
  In the Department of Energy's own words, this center will strengthen 
the region's energy security, bring economic growth for countries 
across the region, deepen geopolitical ties among participating 
governments, and open commercial opportunities for U.S. companies.
  The legislation explicitly notes the earlier legislation that 
authorized this partnership, that the U.S. Government should establish 
the United States-Eastern Mediterranean Energy Center, as authorized by 
section 204 of the Eastern Mediterranean Security and

[[Page H4758]]

Energy Partnership Act of 2019. This center would serve as a critical 
venue to further this collaboration.
  I am thankful for the support of the amendment. I thank, in 
particular, the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies.
  Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to put these important words 
on the record.
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

Madam President, earlier today, Members of Congress had 
the distinct honor of hearing from Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime 
Minister of the State of Israel. He is a leader of one of our most 
steadfast allies in an unprecedented time of strife for his country.
  Prime Minister Netanyahu's message to Congress today was a snapshot 
into the reality that his nation is facing and what they have 
experienced since the morning of October 7. He spoke to the urgency of 
bringing our hostages home and received a standing ovation for that; 
the courage and bravery of his Israeli forces and citizens and received 
a standing ovation for that; and his vision to bring peace, prosperity, 
and security to the Middle East--again, standing room only.
  Israel is a country at war, and, as the only democracy in the Middle 
East and a friend of freedom, Israel deserves the unwavering support of 
these United States. That is why it is incredibly disheartening to see 
that many of our Democratic colleagues were absolutely absent from the 
address--especially the Vice President. Her absence unleashed a 
completely unnecessary discussion about who would join the Speaker to 
preside over the joint address. For a time, her seat behind the podium 
was just simply up for grabs.
  I extend my thanks to my colleague from Maryland, the chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for welcoming Prime Minister 
Netanyahu on behalf of the Senate, and that was Senator Ben Cardin.
  But unfortunately public debate over the Vice President's absence is 
not the message that we should be sending to the world.
  It seems some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have 
forgotten that 291 days ago, on October 7, 2023, Israel was the victim 
of an unprovoked terrorist attack. The attacking force, Hamas, killed 
1,200 innocent Israelis, committed unspeakable acts of sexual violence, 
and took men and women and children as hostages. They also took 
Holocaust survivors. They even took an infant under 1 year old. Prime 
Minister Netanyahu mentioned that infant earlier today. That poor 
child, that poor baby, has now spent more of his life in Hamas 
captivity than in freedom.
  To this day, nearly 10 months later, hostages still remain in 
captivity, including American citizens, and they are being used as 
human shields at the same time. I was incredibly moved to see some of 
the hostages and their families represented in the House Chamber today.
  Hamas has proven itself to be a violent terrorist organization that 
continues to hide underneath schools and hospitals, intentionally 
putting civilians in harm's way. They have publicly called for the 
attacks of October 7 to be repeated again and again and again.
  The bottom line is this: Hamas has made it clear it has no interest 
in seriously negotiating a cease-fire, and they would rather engage in 
barbaric and, honestly, cowardly acts of terror, joining forces with 
terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and the Houthis, which continue 
their bombardment in bombarding Israel in every single direction. Just 
last week, Hezbollah fired 65 rockets into Israel. The Houthis 
conducted a deadly drone attack on Israel's soil as well as a ballistic 
missile that was thankfully intercepted by Israel's air defense. It is 
clear that Israel needs our support now more than ever.
  It is important that we take this moment to reflect on the 
longstanding ties that bind our country to Israel. The United States 
was the very first country to recognize the State of Israel. They have 
been our most stable and longest partner and ally in the Middle East. 
They have stood beside us in our Nation when we faced unprovoked acts 
of terror on our own soil. They have joined with us to develop ties 
with their neighbors through the Abraham Accords. They have been an 
essential ally in our efforts to dismantle Iran's nuclear program. This 
is a level of historic partnership that cannot be forgotten. Yet far 
too many in our country are willing to abandon our relationship with 
Israel, starting with this administration.
  Israel is in a fight for their survival against a terrorist 
organization that is not bound by laws. We know what it is like to be 
attacked in our country, but we don't know what it is like to be 
geographically surrounded by our worst enemies.
  Standing with Israel should not be an issue that divides us but, 
rather, one that unites us in defense of our longtime ally and friend.
  It is vital that the American public and my Democratic colleagues who 
missed the Prime Minister's speech today acknowledge the differences 
between Israel and Hamas. Israel is a bastion of freedom and 
democracy in the Middle East who is engaged in a war they did not 
start, by an organization whose only goal--only goal--is to destroy 
Israel. In keeping with their stated goal, Hamas has unleashed 
horrific, illegal, and unthinkable acts of violence on people simply 
because they are Jewish or Israeli.

  Hamas and their allies have made commanding use of the information 
space to sway public opinion here in our country, in the United States, 
in an attempt to make it appear that Israel is the aggressor in this 
conflict. My Republican colleagues, including those joining me here in 
these speeches today, know that claim is far from the truth.
  As the Prime Minister mentioned today, misinformation has long been 
used to target Israel and the Jewish people, and we have seen it lead 
to chaos on our college campuses and acts of aggression of anti-
Semitism I never thought I would see. We have protesters waving Hamas, 
Houthis, and Hezbollah flags on streets right here in the United 
States, including today, surrounding the Capitol. At Union Station, 
they are burning the American flag.
  After those protesters were publicly applauded and will be--the ones 
today will be publicly applauded by the Supreme Leader of Iran, we now 
know that Iran is working behind the scenes to fan the flames of these 
protests.
  We need to be honest with ourselves about what each side of this 
conflict wants. The actions of Hamas are indefensible, and protesters 
conveniently forget that there was a cease-fire in place on the morning 
of October 7.
  I would say to these protesters: If the Iranian Supreme Leader thinks 
that you are on the right side of history, that is a pretty clear sign 
that you are not.
  The reality is this: Both Israelis and Americans want the fighting to 
end. For that to happen, both sides of the conflict need to agree to 
stop. That means Israel, but it also means Hamas. And right now, we are 
missing that signal from Hamas.
  As the Prime Minister mentioned in his speech today, Hamas could end 
this right now. Hamas must surrender, and Hamas must return the 
hostages.
  Now more than ever, our Nation must reject terrorism and stand with 
our ally Israel. While the White House has left our relationship in 
limbo, Republicans will not let it falter. We will continue to push for 
true American leadership on the world stage that keeps our promises to 
our friends in their time of need, that strikes fear in our adversaries 
and those who wish to do our allies harm, and that returns the moral 
clarity that is deeply needed in moments like this.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.
  Mrs. BRITT. Madam President, I rise today in support of America's 
great ally, Israel. Israel is more than an ally; she represents hope in 
the Middle East, hope for the world.
  I actually visited Israel 2 weeks after October 7, after that attack, 
visited with a bipartisan delegation not only to Israel but throughout 
the Middle East.
  Remember that Israel was created after the Holocaust so that the 
Jewish

[[Page S5333]]

people would never have to hide again. This is something that former 
Israeli Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer talked to us about 
during our visit.
  A colleague of mine shared that his daughter asked him right after 9/
11: Are we safe?
  The truth is that October 7 was similar to our 9/11. However, there 
is also a large difference. On October 8, Israel knew exactly who the 
perpetrator was. They knew exactly where they were. They were just 
miles away--their neighbor. It is like if we woke up on September 12, 
2001, and we had the terrorists who had masterminded the attacks of 9/
11 living next door in Brooklyn. Additionally, they said they would 
come back again and again and again and again until they eradicated the 
Jewish people and the State of Israel.
  That is the proximity and the gravity of the threat that Israel 
faces. It is literally at their doorstep. And, bottom line, they can't 
tell their daughters that they are safe right now.
  Madam President, 291 days--over 9 months--have passed now, but we 
can't forget what happened on October 7. Make no mistake, what Hamas 
did was pure evil.
  They murdered entire families, beheaded babies, dragged 
grandparents--some, Holocaust survivors--from their wheelchairs to a 
brutal death. They raped women. They took mothers and daughters hostage 
after slaughtering their fathers and brothers. They held innocent 
people hostage and used them as human shields.
  As I think about this as a mom, I can't imagine the agony that 
parents were going through knowing that their children, their loved 
ones, are being held hostage and used as human shields. I think about 
the moment when they talk about parents being murdered in front of 
their children, children being murdered in front of their parents. How 
could anyone be so evil?
  There is no doubt that ``never again'' is now, and not just 
overseas--unfortunately, here at home. Look no further than the 
disgusting pro-Hamas anti-Semitic protests that have taken place on 
college campuses, in cities across our Nation, and today in our 
Nation's capital.
  Today, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu came before Congress 
and asked us to do what we promised: to stand behind Israel, to stand 
behind the Jewish people.
  America cannot be a country of broken promises. We cannot let our 
allies down. We cannot be viewed as a country that is weak and 
unreliable around the world. We must stand strongly with Israel and 
show her support not just in normal times, but when she needs us the 
most.
  Israel has more than a right to defend herself; she has an 
obligation. She has an obligation to freedom-loving people around the 
world, as a beacon of democracy in the Middle East, and to the very 
people that she serves.
  Israel must ensure that this never happens again. America can and 
must help Israel fulfill that mission, help to bring every single 
hostage home, and help to bring about sustainable peace and more 
prosperity there in the Middle East.
  Remember, Hamas doesn't just want to destroy peace in the Middle 
East; they want to destroy Israel and wipe the Jewish people off the 
face of the planet.
  We also have to remember who funds and fuels Hamas. It is time to use 
every tool in our toolbox to dry up Iran financially. We have done it 
before under the Trump administration, and I know we can do it again. 
This isn't complicated. The more money that Iran has--they use it for 
nuclear proliferation, and they use it to fund terrorism. They fund 
Hamas in Gaza; they fund the Houthis in Yemen; and they fund Hezbollah 
in Lebanon. We know what that means for Israel, and, frankly, we know 
what that means for America.
  It is past time to reestablish credibility in America and its 
deterrence. We will only achieve peace through strength, and that means 
giving Israel everything she needs to permanently end the threat of 
Hamas.
  As I listened to Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech today, I was in 
awe of the Israeli people's courage: the courage to fight for 
democracy, the courage to secure peace in the Middle East, and the 
courage to fight for their very existence.
  Congress is behind Israel. Alabama, the first State in America to 
call for the establishment of the Jewish State, stands behind Israel. 
And the United States of America is behind Israel.
  As a Christian, as an American, as an Alabamian, I firmly support 
Israel, and I am incredibly proud to do so.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.
  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to join my colleague from Alabama 
and other colleagues and outline the importance of maintaining and 
continuing to strengthen our Nation's support for our essential ally in 
the Middle East, Israel.
  The U.S.-Israel partnership is vital for Israel. It is vital for the 
United States. It is vital for security in the world. It is vital in 
this global fight against terror.
  Israel needs our help. It needs our help to fend off numerous attacks 
from Iran and its proxies, and I am proud of the contributions our 
Armed Forces have made in helping defend Israel from a wide variety of 
drone and missile attacks. The skill of our committed airmen, airwomen, 
soldiers, sailors, marines, special forces--their skill, unbelievable; 
their bravery, courage under fire; the technology that we have 
utilized, it is just incredible. The things that they have been able to 
do in terms of helping Israel, it is just beyond belief. And so we 
commend all of them.

  But we need to continue. We need to continue. We need to help Israel 
defeat Hamas. They need our help to completely destroy Hamas's military 
capability, and we can't relent until that is done. This is not a one-
way partnership. This is not just the United States supporting our ally 
Israel. Israel is really the tip of the spear.
  Israel plays a vital role in standing against terror and deterring 
Iranian aggression across the Middle East. When you look at Hamas, 
Hezbollah, Houthis, and other groups, these are terrorists that are 
financed, trained, sponsored, and directed by Iran. We need to 
recognize that. We need to take a tough stance on sanctions and other 
measures against Iran and recognize that these proxies for Iran are 
conducting its missives, its directions.
  We are deeply appreciative of Israel's efforts to push back on Iran, 
on the Houthis, on terrorists, and all those who seek to destabilize 
not only the Middle East region, but across the world.
  And as we have heard Prime Minister Netanyahu say many times of these 
extremists: If they are not stopped in the Middle East, they will set 
their sights on America. They will, and they have, and they will 
continue to do so.
  Our partnership with Israel is based on our shared values and our 
shared commitment to freedom. Without that partnership, terrorists, 
extremists, and authoritarians would run rampant across the Middle East 
and other parts of the world, threatening the global economy and 
positioning themselves to threaten the United States directly.
  And so the peace and stability we seek in the Middle East will come 
as the result of a strong U.S.-Israel partnership, and that is 
emblematic of the type of relationships that we must have with our 
allies. We must stand with our allies and stand up against our 
adversaries. And standing with our allies means not second-guessing 
them; for example, when Israel is conducting this war, they know how to 
defeat Hamas. And we need to help them do it, not second-guess how they 
are doing it.
  That is why it is so important that we heard from Prime Minister 
Netanyahu in person today. We needed to hear directly from him about 
exactly what is going on as Israel prosecutes this war and the support 
that they need to be successful in defeating Hamas. And now we need to 
move in a bipartisan fashion to continue to strengthen that 
relationship.
  There is really no time to lose. Iran's time to a nuclear breakout is 
down to a very short period. We need to stand together and prevent Iran 
from developing and, potentially, deploying a nuclear weapon.
  Hamas remains a dangerous terrorist organization. Hezbollah presents 
a growing threat in northern Israel. The Houthis, backed by Iran, pose 
a threat to Israel and the wider region in the

[[Page S5334]]

Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf, attacking shipping from many different 
countries.
  So it is essential that we make sure that Israel has the military 
assistance required to stand against these threats. Again, they are the 
tip of the spear. They are doing the fighting, and we need to help 
them. We need to offer all the support we can in every form, and we 
must oppose anti-Semitism in all its forms and wherever we find it.
  I want to express my appreciation for Prime Minister Netanyahu's 
visit and for his remarks to our joint session of Congress today. I 
thought it was an incredibly powerful and moving speech and one that 
not only the Senators and the Members of Congress needed to hear but 
all Americans--all Americans--needed to hear. And I hope that we can 
respond to the Prime Minister's visit by continuing to move in a 
bipartisan way to work with Israel to defeat the threats it faces and 
affirm our shared values, our shared commitment to freedom, liberty, 
and democracy.
  Standing with Israel is good for the United States. It is good for 
the region. It is good for the world.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.
  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, this afternoon Prime Minister Binyamin 
Netanyahu, in his remarks to a joint session of Congress, reiterated to 
Congress; to us, the Senate; to the American people; and, really, to 
the world his determination to defend his country from terrorists 
supported by Iran who seek the elimination of the Jewish State of 
Israel.
  The United States must continue to provide Israel with crucial 
military and diplomatic support to make certain the dangers Israel 
faces can be deterred; and that, if possible, they are defeated, 
defeated those efforts to terrorize Israel.
  The horrific attack by Hamas 9 months ago remains vivid in our 
thoughts. A few weeks after that attack, I was in Israel to visit with 
the Prime Minister, to hear firsthand the circumstances that Israel and 
its citizens faced.
  In addition to those killed, the widespread instances of sexual 
assault and taking hostage of elderly and infants--under these 
circumstances, no person, no person of conscience, can fail to 
understand the desire to eliminate Hamas as a threat to the people of 
Israel.
  Our continued assistance to Israel is in our own national interest 
because the threats our friends face are also threats faced by the 
United States. This conflict may seem distant from our shores, but make 
no mistake that those who seek Israel's destruction, aspire to harm 
American citizens wherever they may be, including here at home.
  Madam President, 12 Americans were taken hostage by Hamas on October 
7, and 8 still remain held in captivity. Many hostages have died in 
captivity these last 9 months, making it imperative that Hamas 
immediately free our citizens.
  Hezbollah continues to menace Israel on the northern border with fire 
being exchanged daily, forcing the evacuation of thousands of Israelis. 
With more than 100,000 rockets aimed at Israel, Hezbollah, like Hamas, 
is a direct threat to American citizens living there. It is true there; 
it is true beyond Israel.
  The intelligence community's worldwide threat assessment released 
this year found that Hezbollah ``maintains the capability to target 
U.S. persons and interests in the region, worldwide, and, to a lesser 
extent, in the United States.'' That assessment warns that that group 
will ``continue to develop its global terrorist capabilities.''
  Our government--the United States of America--must commit, alongside 
our allies and our partners, to degrading Hezbollah's capabilities as a 
matter of international security.
  As we saw, as recently as last Friday's drone strike on a Tel Aviv 
apartment building, the Houthis in Yemen also pose a significant 
regional threat. Their slogan, of course, includes ``Death to America, 
Death to Israel.''
  Their capabilities are expanding and have disrupted shipping through 
the Red Sea by launching attacks on cargo vessels. In response, the 
U.S. Navy has worked the last 8 months to reestablish the freedom of 
navigation.
  All these attacks--these three groups--what they have in common, with 
their varying ideologies, is the support that is provided to them by 
Iran. It is financial aid. It is weapons. It is training. Iran sustains 
these groups at the expense of our friends in the region and at the 
expense of our own security and well-being.
  Almost exactly 1 year ago today, I stood on this Senate floor--I 
stood here in the Senate--and called on President Biden to enforce the 
bipartisan sanctions Congress had passed to choke off the resources 
Tehran uses to fund its activities. The regime has plotted terrorist 
attacks on our soil and threatens to assassinate former President Trump 
along with other officials from his administration. With its nuclear 
program now only weeks away from producing nuclear weapons, it is all 
the more imperative to take measures authorized by Congress.
  Israel's existence is nonnegotiable, and our shared adversaries must 
not doubt the resolution of American support. That is one reason why I 
viewed it as critical to pass the national security supplemental 
earlier this year, which provided Israel with $26 billion to bolster 
its military.
  Standing with Israel goes beyond a one-off piece of legislation, and 
I would remind my colleagues that we have begun the appropriations 
process here in the U.S. Senate. And I will continue this year to 
advocate for military assistance that strengthens Israel's abilities to 
defend itself.
  As the committee begins to mark up 12 bills for the next fiscal year, 
I remind my colleagues that it is important we quickly advance our 
appropriations legislation because of what is at stake for our Nation 
and for our allies and for those who support our friends.
  Support for Israel goes beyond Israel's security. That is an 
important goal in and of itself. But I remind my colleagues that 
support for Israel is support for the United States of America.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.
  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
following Senators be permitted to speak, for up to 5 minutes each, 
prior to the scheduled rollcall vote: Senators Wicker, Barrasso, and 
Ricketts.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, we stand here today having had the 
opportunity in a joint session of Congress to hear one of the most 
powerful and profound and significant addresses that has ever been made 
to a joint session of Congress.
  We have a few people listening in right now. I notice we have a 
number of our pages on the floor. I am glad that our young people--our 
rising seniors in high school who work for us--were able to be there 
and to be here in Washington, in this Capitol, and see and listen to 
this magnificent speech today by Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister 
of the State of Israel--our steadfast ally, the only democracy in that 
section of the world. And, I will say, I doubt if we will very often 
see remarks that were as powerful and as important.
  Israel has been our steadfast ally for over seven decades. It was a 
Democratic President, Harry Truman, postwar, who put his administration 
behind the recognition of the Jewish State in Palestine as Israel, and 
we became one of the earliest countries to recognize Israel. That has 
stood for over seven decades.
  The recognition by the United States, on a bipartisan basis, has 
recognized an important fact: that the Jewish people are certainly not 
colonialists in the Holy Land. The place where Israel exists now is the 
place where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and Esau were born and lived in 
the era of 5,000 years ago.
  To say that the Jewish people are colonialists in Israel is the Big 
Lie. The Big Lie is something that our enemies have used down through 
the years. You say something so unbelievable and so unimaginable; if 
you say it long enough, people will start to believe it.

  The Jewish people are no colonialists in the Holy Land. The Holy Land 
is their ancestral home, and they deserve--the world's Jewish people 
deserve--a Jewish State so they can avoid the centuries of 
discrimination and anti-Semitism that they have endured over time.

[[Page S5335]]

  The Jewish people, as I say--the Israeli people--which includes, of 
course, people who are not Jewish by heritage, have had the only 
democracy in the area for the longest time. And they have been 
surrounded by people who want nothing less than the destruction of 
Israel, and they don't make any bones about it.
  Support in this Congress--support in the United States--for Israel 
has for these seven decades always been bipartisan. And it breaks my 
heart--and I think it should come as a shock to all Americans--that 
bipartisan support seems to be fracturing on the other side of the 
aisle among my Democratic colleagues.
  It is a shame that the Vice President of this country--the Vice 
President of the United States, Kamala Harris--declined to fulfill her 
duties to preside over the session. She found an excuse in another 
State to be at a meeting that could easily have been rescheduled. It is 
a shame that our Vice President--that the future nominee of her party 
for President of the United States--would make that statement that she 
was unwilling to preside over a joint meeting addressed by the Prime 
Minister of Israel.
  The President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate refused to attend. Many 
Members of this body on the Democratic side of the aisle and many 
Members of the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives 
boycotted this speech by our steadfast ally of 70 years or more.
  I noticed, when the Prime Minister of Israel came down through the 
center aisle there in the House of Representatives, shaking hands on 
both sides, and he rounded the corner, and the majority leader of this 
body, the senior Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, declined to 
extend his hand to the Prime Minister of this, our steadfast ally.
  We also need to remember, as my colleagues have stated already, that 
in the region where Israel is the only democratic government, in the 
Middle East, exists the Islamic Republic of Iran. They are a sworn 
enemy of Israel, and they are a sworn enemy of the United States of 
America. ``Death to America'' is what they say. And they want to start 
with ``Death to America'' by pronouncing ``Death to Israel.''
  More than that, they have proxies--at least three proxies--that we 
have been talking about recently: the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah to 
the north of Israel, and Hamas, the terrorist group that perpetrated 
the October slaughter on people near Gaza.
  Hamas has one reason to exist--one stated, admitted reason and one 
reason only: the complete destruction of Israel. And they demonstrated 
their ruthlessness on October 7: rapes, beheadings, babies being 
burned, unspeakable acts of violence. And Prime Minister Netanyahu was 
correct to point out that people protesting outside this building on 
behalf of Hamas should be ashamed of themselves in protesting on behalf 
of a group that was so violent.
  Hamas uses civilians as human shields. That is a violation of 
international law. By contrast--contrary to what people have been told 
in the press--Israel is doing the best job that any combatant has ever 
done in protecting civilians while trying to root out terrorist groups.
  I am calling on people on both sides of the aisle, in conclusion, to 
return to our bipartisan support of the right of a people to exist 
somewhere and to have one place on the face of the Earth where they 
know they can be safe in their own beliefs, in their own population, 
and, for the first time in centuries and millennia, to be safe and have 
their own homeland.
  So I congratulate the Prime Minister of Israel. I congratulate the 
Members of Congress who received him well. And I invite my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle to remember the importance of bipartisan 
support for Israel.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cortez Masto). The Senator from Wyoming."

  Where do you stand when children in Gaza are being killed by the 
thousands?
  Where do you stand when the infrastructure of Gaza is being 
destroyed--schools, hospitals, homes?
  Where do you stand?
  I cannot in good conscience stand with Mr. Netanyahu. I will not be 
in this facility today when he speaks. I will not, if it is a 
standalone bill, vote to send another dime to Mr. Netanyahu's 
administration.
  It is not just Hamas that he wants to destroy. He is destroying Gaza, 
and he would, if he could, take all of Palestine.
  Mr. Speaker, I cannot in good conscience stand in this House today 
and say that I will attend the Netanyahu address to Congress for the 
same rationale that caused me to vote against the Israel Security 
Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2024. I include in the Record the 
entirety of my rationale, which was published in a Houston Chronicle 
full-page ad on April 25, 2024.

     Re Why I voted no on The Israel Security Supplemental 
         Appropriations Act of 2024
       Israel suffered a tragic loss on October 7, 2023. The 
     people of Israel are in mourning. The lives of innocent 
     civilian Israeli men, women, and especially children matter. 
     They must be protected. This includes the hostages, all of 
     whom must be immediately returned in tandem with a lasting 
     ceasefire as the genesis of a two-state solution.
       After the horrific human rights violations committed by 
     Hamas on October 7, 2023, the Netanyahu administration had 
     just cause catalyzing a de jure right to pursue justice as it 
     did by declaring war on Hamas, not hundreds of thousands of 
     innocent civilian Palestinian men, women, and especially 
     children.
       To the contrary, and shamefully, Prime Minister Netanyahu 
     has engaged in an unjust, revengeful, might-makes-right 
     offense, creating more enemies than have been killed. He has 
     engaged in lethal atrocities wherein the ends of destroying 
     Hamas justifies:
       Killing thousands of innocent civilian Palestinian 
     children;
       Collectively harming thousands upon thousands of innocent 
     civilian Palestinian men, women, and especially children;
       Failing to properly aid hundreds of thousands of food-
     deprived Palestinians; and
       Committing domicide by destroying approximately 62 percent 
     of Palestinian homes in Gaza, as well as damaging at least 84 
     percent of Gaza's health facilities, together with over 275 
     schools.
       It has become intuitively and painfully obvious to me that 
     Prime Minister Netanyahu's definition of ``the right to 
     defend'' embraces an invidious ends-justifies-the-means 
     strategy. This imprudent and unjust strategy of domicide, 
     collective harm, and failure to feed the hungry, in tandem 
     with the killing of thousands of innocent Palestinian 
     children, cannot in good conscience receive a blind eye.
       No one, no political entity, no country can commit such 
     atrocious injustices in the name of justice and expect the 
     blessings of people of good will. Injustice in the name of 
     justice is still an injustice. Israel's de jure right (in the 
     hands of Prime Minister Netanyahu) to defend itself in the 
     name of justice has metamorphosed into unconscionable de 
     facto human rights violations that offend the conscience and 
     grievously tarnishes Israel's global image. In truth, Prime 
     Minister Netanyahu's might makes right, by any means 
     necessary--war--is making Israel an existential threat to 
     Palestinians living in Gaza.
       I cannot in good conscience oppose the above-cited 
     atrocious transgressions and contemporaneously provide the 
     munitions which can beget more of these God-awful 
     inhumanities. Sadly, but righteously, I cannot vote to send 
     the pending billions of supplemental funds to the opprobrious 
     administration of Prime Minister Netanyahu. To do so would 
     allow those funds, or free up other funds in their treasury, 
     to purchase the lethality to kill more innocent civilian 
     Palestinian men, women, and especially children, which I 
     oppose.
       Palestinians (like Israelis) are in mourning, and the lives 
     of innocent civilian Palestinian men, women, and especially 
     children matter. They too must be protected.
       For the reasons enumerated above, I voted no on The Israel 
     Security Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2024."

be able to hear Binyamin Netanyahu speak to a joint session of 
Congress. It is the fourth time Binyamin Netanyahu has spoken in 
Congress.
  This particular invitation was different, though. During a time of 
war, it is much more heightened than it has been for a long time. He 
came in a very serious tone to be able to tell America and Americans: 
Thank you for standing with us as Israel.
  And the second thing we heard from him over and over again is: Don't 
forget why we are in this war.
  He introduced hostages that have been released. He introduced 
families whose loved ones are still hostages. He introduced members of 
the IDF who lost limbs or fought against terrorism. And he reminded 
Americans that more than 1,200 people died on October 7 of last year, 
and 253 people were taken hostage at that time.
  This war would be over right now if Hamas would release their 
hostages. This is not a war that Israel started. There is a barrier and 
a fence between Israel and Gaza. Gaza was there; Israel was there.
  But thousands of terrorists from Hamas crossed through that barrier 
early on Saturday morning on October 7, on a Jewish holiday, and 
slaughtered children in their beds, killed moms and dads, and carried 
out the worst act of terrorism that Israel has ever seen. So Israel is 
responding.
  Prime Minister Netanyahu committed again that they will continue to 
fight until they bring every single one of those hostages home, even as 
they continue the negotiations to try to stop the war.
  Currently, Israel is literally surrounded by enemies coming at them. 
It is something we lose track of in the United States. Israel now faces 
Hamas actively attacking them through terrorist actions and continuing 
to threaten, as Hamas leaders, even in the past month, have said that 
if given the opportunity, they would come back and do an October 7 all 
over again. They never relented. And they continue to put civilians 
between them and harm to try to protect the lives of the militants by 
using civilians as shields.
  But many Americans forget that Hezbollah from the north in Lebanon 
continues to launch rockets consistently into Israel every day. And 
80,000 Israelis currently are internally displaced inside Israel, 
fleeing from their own homes; and they have been away from their homes 
now for 10 months because 10 or more rockets a day are coming into 
northern Israel as they continue to launch at them over and over.
  While American media has ignored that, the people of Israel cannot, 
because they live under that threat every single day. From the West 
Bank, there continues to be attacks that are happening on a weekly 
basis. From Syria, there continues to be attacks from Iranian-backed 
militants there. The same with Iraq.
  And just in the past 2 weeks, Yemen has landed one of their attack 
drones inside a neighborhood in Tel Aviv. Now, they have launched 
hundreds at Israel, but this was the first time they actually struck 
one of their targets. And Houthi leaders inside Yemen celebrated by 
saying: We have finally killed some Israelis.
  Israel is literally surrounded every single day. All of those 
militant groups are all funded by the Iranian regime--all of them. We 
as Americans sometimes point at Iran and say: They are the problem. And 
we lose track of the simple fact it is not the Iranian people. The 
people of Iran live under the oppression of the Iranian regime that 
they would like to be free from as well.
  But the entire region is destabilized by the actions and the 
terrorist activities of just that Iranian leadership and that regime. 
They are funding Hezbollah. They are funding Hamas. They are funding 
the militants in Syria and in Iraq. They are funding and providing all 
the trajectory for the Houthis and attacking ships in the Red Sea, as 
well as launching at Israel on a regular basis. It is Iran that is 
doing that.

[[Page S5526]]

  And we as the United States should do whatever we can to apply the 
maximum amount of pressure on Iran and on that regime to be able to 
shut off the flow of money and shut off their ability to be able to 
sell oil worldwide so we can continue to be able to put pressure on 
them so they are not flowing money to terrorist organizations that are 
attacking Israel on a regular basis.
  Now, I understand that what I have just stated is controversial to 
some people in the United States. As Binyamin Netanyahu was speaking 
yesterday, at Union Station, just four blocks from where I am standing 
right now, there were people that were waving Palestinian flags, 
climbing on the statue of Christopher Columbus with spray paint, 
painting on Christopher Columbus's statue--four blocks from here on 
Union Station--``Hamas is coming,'' while they burned American flags 
and burned Israeli flags. Four blocks from here.
  I am keenly aware that not every American is supportive of what is 
happening in Israel. But we are the United States of America. Israel is 
our ally. She is a functioning democracy in the chaos of the Middle 
East, and we should continue to stand with Israel because she is facing 
terrorism, just as we have faced terrorism.
  As Binyamin Netanyahu reminded all Americans yesterday, Iran really 
wants to destroy America. Just Israel is between Iran and America, so 
they go after Israel first.
  There is something growing in America though. And it is a growing 
anti-Semitism that is occurring, something Senator Rosen and I have 
talked about for years. We talked about what is happening on college 
campuses. After October 7, the anti-Semitism on our university campuses 
nationwide has now exploded into full view. What has been trained into 
students by faculty that are anti-Israel is now bearing fruit in public 
demonstrations. It is funded by we don't know who yet, but definitely 
organized and funded and well-equipped.
  Today, Senator Rosen and I held an anti-Semitism hearing with college 
students from six different college campuses. They came and told their 
story of what it is like to be a Jewish student on an American college 
campus. And I think this body needs to be able to hear their story, 
because not everyone was able to be in that hearing today.
  Let me just share the stories, because for some people, they just set 
it aside and say: There are a few places and there are minor things 
that are happening, but it is no big deal. Let me share what Jewish 
students on six different college campuses are saying to us in the U.S. 
Senate today.
  There is a student that is from Columbia University. I will leave the 
names out to be able to protect them. She gave us testimony today 
saying this:

       In the fall semester alone, I endured harassment in the 
     middle of the night and repeated vandalism of my property and 
     resident-assistant bulletin boards, resulting in eventual 
     removal due to constant damage.
       I also experienced both traditional and cyber bullying. 
     Within the first week of the October 7th attacks, people 
     began to glare at me, or ignore me entirely, turning away 
     from me even if I greeted them by name. By the end of school 
     year, friends of mine who are now--

  As she said--

     former friends did not even want to be seen with me. But 
     while my experience was harsh, others endured much graver 
     conditions. I have friends who were spat on and physically 
     attacked; I know people who did not leave their dorm rooms 
     for days [at a time] because they were too afraid of what 
     might happen to them. This is, of course, not even to mention 
     the encampment nor the demonstrations at individual Columbia 
     school graduations that--while I hate to admit it--really did 
     spoil the entire ceremony . . . And throughout it all, these 
     students have waved the Palestinian flag. But this has never 
     been about Palestine; it has not even truly concerned [about] 
     the war in the Gaza Strip. It has always been a protest 
     against the existence of a Jewish State.
       At Columbia, people chant that zionists are not welcome, 
     calling on ``death to the Jewish State.'' One student leader 
     said that ``zionists don't deserve to live.''

  Another student from Rutgers University said:

       We tracked [and] endured [and] experienced more than 200 
     incidents of bias/antisemitism since October 7. This 
     represents the supermajority of all bias incidents on campus. 
     This has created an environment where Jewish students feel 
     unsafe, especially since the attack October 7th, with almost 
     300 days passing without a sense of security on campus or in 
     their classrooms at Rutgers.
       Throughout the last week of the semester and during finals 
     in the spring, there was an encampment in solidarity with 
     Hamas, a U.S.-recognized terror organization, on [Vorhees] 
     Mall in the heart of the College Avenue campus that disrupted 
     classes, student learning, and threatened the safety of 
     Jewish students on campus.

  That is at the second campus. The third campus, George Washington 
University, a student there said to us:

       On the night of April 29, encampment participants staged a 
     riot, ripping down the fences that were put up by the 
     university around the yard. They stood on the pile of fences 
     while chanting euphemisms for mass murder and desecrating a 
     statue of George Washington.
       Signs in the encampment bore the words ``final solution'' 
     and swastikas. Another read, ``Israelis go back to Europe, 
     [your real homes]. Protesters claimed to be fighting for 
     peace yet [they] preached the opposite, chanting: We don't 
     want no 2 states,'' ``Globalize the intifada,'' and ``Hamas 
     are freedom fighters.'' One student said, ``when we say we 
     don't want Zionists here, we really mean it.''

  At Ohio State University:

       On my campus, Jewish sorority girls were spat on while 
     selling bracelets with the words ``I stand with Israel.'' Two 
     assailants vandalized our Hillel building, our center for 
     Jewish life while screaming anti-Israel and anti-Semitic 
     obscenities. Two Jewish students were assaulted and spent the 
     night in the hospital after being physically stopped on the 
     street. A group of Jewish girls had pennies thrown at them. 
     Early one morning, several men approached the Jewish Alpha 
     Epsilon Pi fraternity, screaming--

  I am not going to say it--
     and throwing bottles at the house. Students for Justice in 
     Palestine entered our main library and chanted antisemitic 
     slogans for over an hour without facing any consequences.

  Interestingly enough, in my home State, we had a student that was 
there that had transferred from another university to the University of 
Oklahoma. He had said he wanted to be able to find ``a legal education, 
free of fear of having to bite my tongue; forced to hide my identity 
and [my] thoughts'' all the time. He thought his best chance would be 
to attend a law school on a campus like the University of Oklahoma.
  He said he came there and he openly discussed his faith to see what 
the climate would be like. He said:

       The spirit of Dr. Ada remains strong.

  I will have to tell you that story another time. It is a great story 
on Dr. Ada.
  He said:

       I . . . have . . . been warmly received by everyone there, 
     and am receiving the educational experience I wish [I could 
     have received at Indiana University].

  Then I have to tell you this story. A student from Oregon 
University--she came and said:

       Flyers were handed out glorifying the Palestinian 
     resistance and celebrating the ``Al Aqsa flood''--

  That is the October 7 attack--

     as an act of ``decolonization.'' Signs called for the 
     abolition of the state of Israel, saying: ``from the river to 
     the sea.''
       One graffiti on campus asked, ``How many children did you 
     eat today?''
       When we brought these concerns directly to the University 
     President, we were blamed for not properly reporting these 
     incidents--even though it was entirely unclear where hate 
     bias incidents of this nature were to be reported. It felt 
     degrading. It felt like [it was] victim blaming.

  She asked this question and made this statement. She was very kind. 
She said:

       I want to thank Senators Rosen and Lankford for introducing 
     the bipartisan Countering Antisemitism Act--which takes 
     tangible action to address some of the issues I have talked 
     about today.

  She said this:

       I hope you will work together to get this legislation to 
     the finish line and to deliver for Jewish students who are 
     nervously anticipating entering another challenging academic 
     year this fall.

  What was she asking for? She made it very specific. She wants this 
body to act, to speak out for Jewish students that in a few weeks are 
going to be headed back to their campus, wondering if their campus will 
be the same as it was when they left it, because when they left at 
graduation, there were pro-Hamas rallies at graduations and people 
shouting down Jewish students on campus, belittling them and attacking 
them. They are wondering: If I go back to school at all this fall, what 
will I face? That is not an unrealistic question.

[[Page S5527]]

  So the students that spoke to us asked for some very specific things. 
One is that administrators on university campuses should actually 
enforce the code of conduct on their university campuses--what a 
radical idea. If you have a code of conduct, actually enforce it. Don't 
enforce it on some groups and not on others.
  Some of these students said that on their campus, the protesters that 
were shutting down the library and shutting down graduation got 
meetings with the administration to negotiate what to do and Jewish 
students did not.
  If you have a code of conduct on a university campus--and all of them 
do--don't allow hateful speech and actions to occur on your campus, to 
shut down the education. Don't tell--some of these students faced from 
the administration ``I would encourage you not to go to the library 
today'' when their tuition helped pay for that library the same as 
everyone else's. But to say to one group of protesters ``They have 
taken it over. They really have the occupation. I wouldn't go there. It 
is not safe for you''--why don't you do something crazy, 
administrators? Why don't you make your campus safe for everyone? That 
is one request they have.
  The second request they had was--Congress passed the IHRA definition 
of ``anti-Semitism.'' The House has already passed it. The State 
Department right now uses the International Holocaust Remembrance 
Alliance--the IHRA--definition for ``anti-Semitism'' and has used it 
for more than three decades. It is not controversial for our State 
Department, but we have never required the Department of Education to 
also have that same definition.
  What is happening on university campuses right now is that all these 
statements are being made, as some of the students said today, that 
sound a lot like what Nazi Brownshirts said in Germany years ago to 
Jewish students, being said on American college campuses now, but 
university officials are saying: We don't have a good definition of 
``anti-Semitism,'' so we can't really say that it is anti-Semitic 
hatred.
  We all know it is.
  This body should take the same definition that our State Department 
has used for decades and require the Department of Education to also 
use that same definition of ``anti-Semitism.'' That shouldn't be a 
radical jump for us. The House passed it. We should pass it. That was 
the second request they had.
  The third request they had was to pass the act that Senator Rosen and 
I have already passed through committee to bring it to this body. It is 
noncontroversial, but this body of the Senate has not taken it up. I 
would ask the majority leader to bring up that legislation dealing with 
anti-Semitism before students return to campus this fall to give a 
clear message to those students that the United States stands for 
everyone having the opportunity to be able to speak out their point of 
view, live their faith, and live without fear--especially in an 
educational environment.
  If students want to be pro-Hamas on a university campus, I think it 
is foolish, I think it is a terrible thing to do, but you have the 
right to do it. But you do not have the right to be able to silence and 
intimidate Jewish students on campus at the same time. You do not have 
the right to do that. They have the right to live their faith in safety 
and to be able to go to the school of their choice. It is the United 
States of America. Right now, we have pro-Hamas demonstrators trying to 
frighten Jewish students away from campuses of their choice. That needs 
to stop.
  This body needs to take up the act that Senator Rosen and I have 
brought--that should not be a controversial issue--and to speak out on 
behalf of all those students that are just looking for someone to stand 
with them. So why don't we do that?
  I yield the floor."

  Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I join Vice President Harris in 
condemning yesterday's anti-Israel, pro-Hamas demonstrations.
  The demonstrators may not know that their leaders are funded by Iran 
and Qatar, which fund the organizations and the propaganda. These same 
leaders glorified October 7. They rejoiced at the death of every 
Israeli civilian.
  They condemned Israel on October 7 before Israel had done anything to 
respond because their demonstrations were not about whether Israel 
should not respond. Their demonstrations were a glorification of the 
death brought by Hamas.
  Now, the followers chant, ``From the river to the sea,'' but some of 
them don't even know which river, which sea. What they don't know is 
the background of that slogan, ``From the river to the sea, Palestine 
shall be free.'' It is a declaration that every Jew who lives from the 
river to the sea should be killed or ethnically cleansed.
  Since, as we saw in the 1930s, there is no country that wants to 
accept millions of Jewish refugees, that means they should all be 
killed. That is the chant that we hear, ``From the river to the sea.''
  Prior to October 7, we needed to see a two-state solution, and I hope 
we get there, but there is this effort to convey the life of those who 
lived in Gaza as being somehow equivalent to the Rohingya refugees, 
refugees living in camps in Bangladesh.
  The fact is that those living in Gaza had longer life expectancies 
than the average person in the world, considerably longer than those 
living in Russia, roughly equal to those living in Saudi Arabia. All of 
that was destroyed on October 7.
  Hamas knew exactly what they were doing. They conducted this attack 
for the purpose of the response because they know they cannot achieve 
their political objectives, which, remember, is to expel or kill every 
Jew from the river to the sea.
  They can't possibly achieve those objectives unless they massively 
change world opinion. They know and have said on the record in their 
own comments that every death of a Palestinian civilian helps them 
achieve their ugly purpose.
  That is why we had, in our great Capital, the waving of the Hamas 
flag while they burned the American flag. Make no mistake about it, 
those who hate Israel also hate America. We see our statues desecrated, 
and we see a call by the demonstrators for the final solution. At least 
a few of them understand that ``from the river to the sea'' means 
killing 7 million Jewish Israelis.;"

       Sheldon ``Shelly'' Guren, 99, died Aug. 16, 2024. He was 
     born to Nate and Rose Guren on Oct. 25, 1924.
       Shelly grew up in Cleveland Heights where he excelled in 
     school and athletics. He graduated high school at age 16 and 
     went on to Western Reserve University, now Case Western 
     Reserve University in Cleveland. After World War II, he used 
     the G.I. Bill to go to Harvard Law School in Cambridge, 
     Mass.,

[[Page H5196]]

     where he met his wife Faith Golden, a student at Emerson 
     College in Boston. He and Faith started their life in 
     Cleveland when Shelly joined his uncle Henry Gottfried's law 
     firm.
       He practiced law the remainder of his life while also 
     starting a real estate investment trust, investing in several 
     businesses, teaching Sunday school and being a leader in the 
     Cleveland Jewish community.
       Shelly was intrigued by the state of Israel, with its ``can 
     do'' spirit that in some ways matched his energy and 
     optimism. He and his family spent months on a kibbutz where 
     he helped to focus some of its business practices. He 
     remained connected to that experience both emotionally and 
     philanthropically.
       He was generous, magnetic, bright and fun. He began a 
     boating life with a 34<sup>,</sup> boat at Lakeside Yacht 
     Club in Cleveland and parlayed that into a yachting life, 
     mostly in the Bahamas. He thrived on hosting his friends for 
     weekends living his dream.
       He moved to Miami in the 1970s and spent the next 45 years 
     commuting back to Cleveland to oversee The Great Lakes Towing 
     Company. He loved the opportunity to be home and spend time 
     with his best friend (his brother Homer), his sister-in-law

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the 
anticipated departure of Norfolk Southern Railway's chief executive 
officer, reportedly related to an alleged inappropriate relationship 
with a subordinate.
  One could ask oneself: When did he have time for all of that?
  This is just the latest evidence of poor decision making at the 
highest levels of one of our Nation's largest railroads that has a lot 
of problems that impact every community through which it travels. 
Frankly, giant railroad magnates need to be corralled in the public 
interest. Congress already knows that we cannot trust rail corporate 
leadership to exercise good judgment and take care of failing 
overpasses and underpasses in our communities. Particularly when it 
comes to rail safety, they fail.
  In October of 2022, a Norfolk Southern train derailed in my district 
in Sandusky, Ohio. That is the photo there that I am pointing to. I 
have been privileged to represent it, but over one dozen cars were left 
hanging for months over an overpass on the main entry into a town that 
gets over 5 million visitors a year, spilling paraffin wax all over the 
roadway dripping down and damaging infrastructure.
  Guess what, Mr. Speaker?
  Norfolk Southern, despite endless pleas from the local mayor and 
government officials did nothing for months. They did nothing to clean 
up the mess until 4 months after that mess happened, when a Norfolk 
Southern train that also passed through our district derailed one dozen 
cars in East Palestine, Ohio. That triggered a massive explosion and 
fire which contaminated the air, soil, and water with toxic chemicals.
  Rail safety bills were swiftly introduced in both Chambers in the 
wake of this latter disaster, but Congress has yet to pass the 
legislation.
  Where are the committees in this place?
  Are there all asleep?
  The residents of East Palestine will live with questions about the 
disaster's effects on their health for the rest of their lives.
  For their sakes and for the sake of all the communities in our Nation 
with freight rail tracks running through them, Congress must act now.
  Railroads are not getting safer on their own. According to the 
Federal Railway Administration, the latest annual rail safety data 
reflect troubling trends, including a 41.1 percent increase, a nearly 
50 percent increase in the rate for the human factor that caused 
accidents between 2013 and 2022. That is because the railroads aren't 
hiring enough people to do the job.
  It is past time for the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 
to mark up the bipartisan Railroad Safety Enhancement Act of 2024 and 
for Congress to make real commitments to rail safety.
  It was only after East Palestine happened and we raised questions in 
the national press that Norfolk Southern sent two people back to the 
original site of the accident in Sandusky--two people--to begin 
cleaning up the streets and scrape up all that paraffin and try to 
prevent it from going into the city sewers and so forth.
  I think there are real problems at these railroads, and I can't 
imagine why the committees of jurisdiction are waiting so long. 
Frankly, those people in East Palestine deserve a new town. Companies 
used to build new towns for people, and that is one place in America 
that deserves it."

  Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, almost a year ago Hamas 
unleashed a barbaric attack on Israel slaughtering more than 1,200 
people and kidnapping more than 250 others.
  The safe return of hostages--children, parents, grandparents--has 
been my North Star, but we must not forget about Israelis, Americans, 
and other innocents held hostage.
  Yet today, we mourn six of those hostages who held out for 328 days. 
We mourn: Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Israeli American; Eden Yerushalmi; Ori 
Danino; Alex Lobanov; Carmel Gat; and Almog Sarusi.
  Since October 7, I have met with many hostage families, including 
Hersh's mother and father. I have gotten to know them. I have prayed 
for and with them for a deal to bring their beloved son home alive.
  It is essential that the United States use every diplomatic tool to 
finalize a

[[Page H5206]]

deal to bring the remaining hostages home and end this heartbreaking 
war.
  I will continue to fight for a bilateral cease-fire with the release 
of all remaining hostages, an end to Hamas' reign of inhumanity, and 
lasting peace for Israel and Palestine.
  May their memories be a blessing."

     is co-founder in 1979 of Al-Haq, the Palestinian human rights 
     organization. The Observer loaded him, ``Palestine's greatest 
     prose writer'' and the New York Times Book Review heaps 
     praises as well, ``in his moral clarity and bearing of the 
     heart is self-questioning and assistance on focusing on the 
     experience of the individual within the storms of nationalist 
     myth and hubris, Shehadeh recalls writers such as Ghassan 
     Kanafani and Primo Levi.''
       In his latest book with a challenging title, What Does 
     Israel Fear From Palestine? New York: Other Press. 2024, 
     Shehadeh, clearly a Palestinian patriot who was born in 1951 
     in the West Bank town of Ramallah, offers us a concise packed 
     yet imbalanced perspective on the long and agonizing 
     Palestinian-Israeli conflict that the October 7, 2023, 
     Hamas's vile attack with terrifying Holocaust dimensions, has 
     brought into sharp view with months of fighting and much 
     suffering to both sides. The detail-oriented writer and 
     activist is anchored in the Palestinian saga of loss and 
     grievances going back to the pivotal 1948 victorious Israeli 
     War of Independence which the Palestinians painfully regard 
     as their Nakba (Catastrophe).
       Touching are the author's reminiscences of growing up in 
     Ramallah with his grandma who was a refugee from Jaffa, ever 
     missing her old home and inculcating in her young grandson an 
     attachment to the family's past. ``For a long time, I was 
     hostage to the memories, perceptions and attitudes of others 
     that I could not abandon. My sense of place was not my own.'' 
     However, following the 1967 War when he was able to visit 
     Jaffa, his family's roots gained a realistic sense of 
     belonging. The close physical proximity was a primary factor.
       Shehadeh blames the British for the turn of events 
     culminating in the 1948 Arab defeat and the Palestinian 
     debacle, pointing at the 1917 Balfour Declaration as the root 
     cause, stating that the 1922 to 1948 British Mandate was 
     dedicated to fulfilling the earlier declared British 
     commitment toward the Jewish people. I believe that 
     historians would beg to differ, regarding a gradual British 
     shift in the Arabs' favor and manifested in severe limits on 
     Jewish refugees before and after WWII and the Holocaust. 
     Intense Jewish military pressure was created as the British 
     Empire was disintegrating. The author claims that ``what 
     happened in Palestine was the utter dissolution of a 
     nation,'' notwithstanding the acknowledged fact that no such 
     ``nation'' historically existed yet the Israeli Jewish 
     narrative supported by the Bible claims past millennial 
     Jewish life and creativity which is cavalierly dismissed by 
     the author, ``Israel treated the Bible as a historical 
     document and used it to back up the claim that the land had 
     belonged to the Jews from time immemorial, having been 
     promised to them by the Almighty.''
       He bemoans the fate of the Palestinian Arabs, about 
     160,000, who remained in Israel and were ``forced'' to 
     celebrate Israel Independence Day. Admittedly, they were 
     caught in a bind but there is no evidence that they were 
     coerced to celebrate Israel's national festivals. After all 
     they have enjoyed the benefits of becoming Israeli citizens 
     and significant progress of integration was accomplished 
     though challenges remain in a complex scenario with serious 
     security issues. There is evidence of growing Palestinization 
     of Arab Israelis while polls reflect no desire on their part 
     to trade their Israeli citizenship for an Arab one. There is 
     no mention by the author of the 750,000 Jewish refugees in 
     1948 from Arab lands who left under duress, subject to 
     pogroms and losing their belongings following centuries of 
     discrimination.
       It is hard for Shehadeh to come to grips with Israel's 
     success to establish a modern Jewish national identity, 
     defined by him as ``Zionist colonization,'' with the 
     revitalized Hebrew language bestowing Hebrew names on the 
     rebuilt landscape that had carried Arab ones. He points at, a 
     non-starter, proposal of his late father, Aziz Shehadeh, 
     following the 1967 War, to use the 1947 Partition 
     Resolution--then denied by the Arabs--for a Palestinian 
     state. Abba Eban, Israel's legendary foreign minister, 
     insightfully coined that the Palestinians ``never missed an 
     opportunity to miss an opportunity.'' Indeed, the 
     controversial Jewish State Law of July 19, 2018, caused 
     understandable consternation among Israeli Arabs, exacerbated 
     by the dropping of Arabic as an official language. Sadly, I 
     share with the author, only 3% of Israeli Jews are literate 
     in Arabic. That is part of an important discussion concerning 
     Israel's better integration into the surrounding Arab Middle 
     East while there are those Israelis who prefer a Western 
     orientation. I suggest that both approaches ought be pursued 
     tandem.
       The book's Part Two is dedicated to the Gaza War, 2023-4, 
     triggered by the October 7, 2023, Hamas's massacres which the 
     author thankfully condemns though seemingly impressed with 
     the military aspects of catching Israel by surprise as Egypt 
     did in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the breaking through the 
     failed billion plus costly barrier, along with the heavy 
     Israeli fatalities, casualties and captives. ``The brutality 
     of Hamas's attack and the civilian death toll certainly cast 
     a shadow on their military success.
       Whereas an occupied population has the right under the 
     international law to resist, they have no right to commit war 
     crimes. Still, this time the Palestinians did not fit into 
     the role of victims. To the Israelis it seemed like 
     aggressors who were challenging Israel's very existence.''
       The astute Shehadeh is surely aware that Gaza was returned 
     to the Palestinians in 2005 by then Prime Minister Sharon, 
     followed by Hamas's forceful occupation and the cruel 
     toppling of the Palestinian Authority there with no elections 
     since the 2006 Hamas's ``victory''. He regards the Israeli 
     response to the October 7 Nazi-like Hamas's massacres 
     excessive, expecting public Israeli criticism as back in 1982 
     with the horrific Sabra and Shatila massacres in Lebanon. The 
     author though surely knows that the Christian Phalangists had 
     a decisive hand at that time. Somehow, there is no reference 
     also to Iran's leading role in directing its radical proxies, 
     Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis and others, to prevent the near 
     peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia with the successful 
     foundation of the Abraham Accords. Also, the author's 
     comparison of Israel to the once South African apartheid 
     state is misleading.
       I wholeheartedly concur with Shehadeh's following 
     assessment, ``Young Israelis felt secure enough that they 
     planned a rave night on the border with Gaza. But when Hamas 
     broke through Israel's vulnerability and insecurity were 
     exposed. Israelis were traumatized because they realized they 
     couldn't go on with their life in the same way, making the 
     same assumptions about the reality of the state and its 
     security. Unless, that is, they defeated the aggressor.'' I 
     also share the author's own response to his book's title, 
     ``The very high human and material cost of the war in Gaza 
     proves that what Israel fears from Palestine is Palestine's 
     very existence.'' Surely a Hamas controlled Palestinian state 
     is not accepted by Israel for obvious reasons.
       I do appreciate Shehadeh's optimism concerning the future, 
     ``And yet, looking back at the history of the region it is 
     only after great upheavals that hopeful consequences

[[Page E911]]

     follow.'' However, the central question and challenge remain, 
     whether two separate and contradictory narratives can be 
     reconciled for the future sake of both peoples.

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Anti-BDS Labeling Act''.

     SEC. 2. CONTINUATION IN EFFECT OF COUNTRY OF ORIGIN MARKING 
                   POLICY FOR IMPORTED GOODS PRODUCED IN THE WEST 
                   BANK OR GAZA.

       The policy of the Government of the United States with 
     respect to country of origin marking of imported goods 
     produced in the West Bank or Gaza, notice of which was 
     published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the 
     Federal Register on December 23, 2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 83984), 
     shall remain in effect until repealed by an Act of Congress.

     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO RESCIND OR CHANGE THE 
                   COUNTRY OF ORIGIN MARKING POLICY FOR IMPORTED 
                   GOODS PRODUCED IN THE WEST BANK OR GAZA.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the 
     funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made 
     available for the Department of State or U.S. Customs and 
     Border Protection on or after the date of the enactment of 
     this Act may be obligated or expended to prepare or 
     promulgate any policy; guidance; regulation; notice; or 
     Executive order or to otherwise implement, administer, or 
     enforce any policy that rescinds or changes the policy of the 
     Government of the United States with respect to country of 
     origin marking of imported goods produced in the West Bank or 
     Gaza, notice of which was published by U.S. Customs and 
     Border Protection in the Federal Register on December 23, 
     2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 83984).

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, as amended, shall be debatable for 
1 hour, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means, or their respective 
designees.
  The gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Schneider) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).


                             General Leave

  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all 
Members may have 5 legislative days in

[[Page H5351]]

which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous 
material on this bill under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Missouri?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Anti-BDS Labeling Act 
introduced by my good friend and Committee on Ways and Means colleague, 
Ms. Tenney.
  For years, far-left progressives have targeted Israel through the 
Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. In fact, many of the recent 
campus protests that we saw that came in the wake of the horrific 
terrorist attacks on Israel shut down elite universities to try to 
force university endowments to divest from Israel. For these 
protesters, no step is too far to achieve their goals. The incidents of 
harassment, bullying, and intimidation of Jewish students are at this 
point too numerous to count.
  The Ways and Means Committee will not stop holding these elite 
universities accountable until every Jewish student feels safe on 
campus.
  This small, loud minority does not speak for the vast majority of 
Americans. Let me be clear: America stands with Israel.
  Under President Trump, the alliance between the United States and 
Israel was stronger than ever before. He moved the U.S. Embassy to 
Jerusalem. He brokered the Abraham Accords, sending a message to Iran 
that Israel does not stand alone. He canceled President Obama's 
disastrous Iran nuclear deal. The list goes on and on. One of the items 
on that list of accomplishments was a move to counter the same BDS 
movement fueling the chaos on college campuses.
  In 2020, the Trump administration's Customs and Border Protection 
clarified the labeling of items imported from Israel. Items coming from 
regions of the West Bank under Israeli authority must be labeled as 
coming from Israel, just as labels on items coming from Hamas-
controlled Gaza or areas of the West Bank outside of Israeli control 
must reflect its origin as coming from one of those two areas.
  This bill before us codifies this Trump rule into law and bans the 
use of any Federal dollars to reverse or alter it. American families 
should have this information in order to buy products that support 
Israel's economy, particularly in a time of war.
  Conversely, people should know if an item comes from a region 
controlled by terrorists that kidnapped and killed their fellow 
Americans. Public reports earlier this year indicated that the Biden-
Harris administration considered reversing this policy.
  Once again, Mr. Speaker, Democrats are putting the demands of radical 
progressives ahead of our best ally and our largest trading partner in 
the Middle East.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my Democratic colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this 
legislation and join us in empowering Americans looking to show their 
support for Israel.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 5179, the so-called Anti-BDS 
Labeling Act.
  Let me start with an observation. Since October 7, President Biden, 
the United States Congress, and the United States people have 
overwhelmingly stood in support of Israel as they fight an existential 
war on multiple fronts. President Biden has stood with Israel longer 
than any U.S. President in a time of war throughout Israel's 76-year 
history.
  Let me also be clear that the BDS movement is inherently anti-
Semitic. It is a harmful, discriminatory effort aimed at delegitimizing 
Israel, the democratic Jewish State of Israel, and undermining Israel's 
right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state.
  I will agree with my colleague Chairman Smith, when he says there is 
no place for harassment or intimidation of Jewish students or, for that 
matter, any students on campus for what they believe in.
  The protesters are loud. They scream. They yell. They have yelled 
outside my house in the middle of the night. Being loud does not make 
them right. It just means they are loud.
  So while this body here, Republicans and Democrats, stands united in 
opposing BDS, today's debate is much less about genuine support of 
Israel and much more about political posture.

                              {time}  1530

  I have consistently opposed BDS and worked to ensure U.S. policy does 
not endorse discriminatory aims. However, H.R. 5179 is a symbolic 
gesture with no real path forward in the Senate.
  It does little to combat the global BDS effort and distracts from the 
meaningful action required to strengthen our partnership with Israel 
and promote a peaceful future for the region and all the people in the 
region.
  This issue isn't just about geopolitics or trade. It is about 
consumer transparency. Americans want to know under what conditions 
their products are made.
  Whether it is Israeli law in a settlement, Palestinian Authority 
control, or formerly Hamas-controlled Gaza, consumers deserve to 
understand the governance and standards behind the products they buy.
  The lack of clarity of the current framework does not meet their 
demand for nuanced information about environment, labor, human rights, 
or the quality of inspections of their purchases on products from 
anywhere around the world including within Israel.
  H.R. 5179 fails to address these concerns. It is a short-term 
political move that ignores the complexity of the region and the demand 
for thoughtful policies.
  This bill won't help consumers make informed decisions, nor will it 
move the needle on the broader challenges facing Israel. More broadly, 
it doesn't help dismantle Hamas or rescue the hostages and restore a 
political horizon for a two-state solution.
  While I share the goal with my colleagues of countering BDS, H.R. 
5179 does not achieve that. It is about showmanship, not about 
substance. We need real bipartisan solutions that reflect the region's 
complexities and offer the transparency consumers demand.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and focus on actions 
that will make a real difference.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may 
consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 5179, the 
Anti-BDS Labeling Act.
  The Anti-BDS Labeling Act would codify the Trump administration's 
2020 U.S. Customs and Border Protection rule titled: ``Country of 
Origin Marking of Products from the West Bank and Gaza.''
  In 1997, the Palestinian Authority requested that the U.S. require 
all goods made in Judea and Samaria, and Gaza to be labeled as ``Made 
in West Bank/Gaza.'' This not only recognized Judea and Samaria, and 
Gaza as one territorial unit, which is inaccurate, but also failed to 
recognize that areas of Judea and Samaria are governed by Israel and 
the Palestinian Authority.
  The Trump administration's rule required goods made in Area C of 
Judea and Samaria, which is fully controlled by Israel under the Oslo 
Accords, to be labeled as ``Made in Israel.'' Under this rule, goods 
made in Palestinian Authority-controlled Areas A and B of Judea and 
Samaria to be labeled as ``Made in West Bank.'' This rule appropriately 
recognizes the different governing authorities of various areas of 
Judea and Samaria, as well as ensuring that Gaza and Judea and Samaria 
are recognized as two different political areas.
  The Anti-BDS Labeling Act would codify the Trump-era rule and 
prohibit Federal funds to be used by the White House or executive 
branch to alter the rule that is already in place.
  For years, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement has sought 
to cripple the Israeli economy and impoverish individuals living in 
Israeli-controlled areas of Judea and Samaria, and Israel at large.
  The BDS movement has long targeted goods made in Israeli-controlled 
areas of Judea and Samaria, sometimes referred to by anti-Israel 
advocates as the ``occupied West Bank.'' I would like to remind 
individuals who use this ridiculous term that the Oslo Accords, as

[[Page H5352]]

signed by Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, divided Judea and Samaria 
into three areas, with Israel administering security control over 82 
percent of Judea and Samaria, and civil control of 60 percent of Judea 
and Samaria.
  This bill ensures that there is no distinction in labeling between 
goods made in Israel and Israeli-controlled areas of Judea and Samaria. 
During this difficult time, Congress must stand with Israel and support 
our greatest ally in the region, the lone beacon of freedom and 
democracy.
  I am grateful to Chairman Smith and all my Ways and Means Republican 
colleagues who are supporting this critical legislation, especially 
when it passed through the House Ways and Means Committee. We must 
stand with our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel, and demand 
accuracy in the labeling of goods imported to the United States, as 
required by law.
  This legislation sends a very clear signal that we will not tolerate 
arbitrary differentiations in the labeling of goods from different 
parts of Israel. Whether a good is made in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Efrat, 
the Golan Heights, or Gush Etzion, it should be labeled as ``Made in 
Israel.''
  This is not about political posturing as the ranking member in 
opposition says. This is about making sure that American citizens know 
that when they are purchasing a product in Israeli-controlled Judea and 
Samaria that they are purchasing a product that is made in Israel. 
There is nothing discriminatory about that. It is about preventing the 
erasing of the existence of Israel in this region of Israel.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this 
legislation. It is not political posturing. It is something to protect 
Israeli products, Israeli individuals who are producing these products 
and also to protect American citizens who would be purchasing this 
product and who get to make a decision about what they would choose to 
buy, whether it was made in Israel or not. They make that choice. That 
is something that all Americans are entitled to under this labeling 
act.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this 
legislation.
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Doggett) who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, this bill wrongfully seeks to codify 
Trump's one-state solution.
  Strangely, Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas completely agree on one 
subject, they want from the river to the sea. The only question is: Who 
gets to control and subjugates the other one?
  I believe that subjugation is not security. Rather, it is a time bomb 
that is just getting ready to explode causing more grief and misery to 
all, as we are seeing now with the repeated rocket firing into Israel, 
the ongoing destruction of Gaza, and the escalating settler violence in 
the West Bank.
  I strongly believe in Israel as a democratic Jewish state. The Hamas 
attackers were not martyrs, they were murderers and rapists. They can 
never be a partner for peace, but neither can Netanyahu's cohorts, Ben-
Gvir and Smotrich. They cannot be partners for peace. They have refused 
to be partners for peace, nor do they prioritize the release of the 
hostages. They continue to endanger Israeli security.
  Smotrich, a self-described Fascist, wrongly insists that a hostage 
deal would be surrender. He is responsible for the largest seizure of 
land in the West Bank since the 1993 Oslo Accords. His myopic vision 
for Israel is to annex everything and create a greater Israel that 
incorporates all the so-called Palestinians.
  In a June speech, he said: ``[We] created a separate civilian 
system'' . . . ``It will be easier to swallow in the international and 
legal context.''
  Ben-Gvir told Israeli settlers: ``We are behind you. Run for the 
hilltops, settle them.''
  He promotes an exclusive Israeli control of the land from the Jordan 
River to the Mediterranean Sea. The same message that those people 
protesting Israel are advocating, he is also advocating. He has 
distributed thousands of assault weapons to Israeli settlements to 
drive Palestinians from the West Bank.
  When dozens of armed Israeli settlers stormed one West Bank village, 
firing bullets and setting homes on fire, they said that they were 
``Ben-Gvir's gang here to kill the Arabs.''
  Smotrich and Ben-Gvir should be sanctioned for their incitement of 
violence. It has led to 1,000 incidents of settlers driving over 1,300 
Palestinians from their homes since October 7, with 600 Palestinians 
killed.
  Unfortunately, at the same time that Gaza is being rendered 
uninhabitable, Netanyahu's refusal to stop settler violence in the West 
Bank and the expansion of these West Bank settlements are all designed 
to prevent a Palestinian state from ever coming into being in a viable 
way.
  Like this very bill, their goal is to block creation of any 
Palestinian state and to refer to it as Judea and Samaria, rather than 
many of us, who consider ourselves to be strongly for Israel, calling 
it the occupied territories because it has been occupied since the 1967 
war.
  The only hope for lasting peace and security is for a Jewish state 
and a Palestinian state to be side by side and find security guarantees 
for each. That will be a long, difficult, and challenging process. We 
have been unable to accomplish it for decades, but it is the only 
process that we can undertake that will truly lead to the survival and 
the viability of Israel, so it is not a matter of a temporary peace and 
another threat to innocent people on either side of the line.
  Efforts to conflate the occupied territories with Israel defeat any 
real hope of a lasting solution. We should reject the approach that 
Trump, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich, Netanyahu, and Hamas all share, of a river 
to the sea, a one-state approach, because that is only a recipe for an 
endless war and untold suffering.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Steube).
  Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Ms. Tenney's 
Anti-BDS Labeling Act. The United States is Israel's single largest 
trade partner. This bill would codify a Trump administration notice 
that required products made in certain areas of Judea and Samaria be 
labeled as originating from Israel.
  In April, I led a letter to the Biden-Harris administration slamming 
them for considering reversing the labeling policy. It is common sense 
for goods produced in certain areas of Judea and Samaria, also known as 
the West Bank, to be labeled as made in Israel because Israel exercises 
relevant authorities in these areas. President Trump was absolutely 
right to issue the product of Israel policy because Israel is exactly 
where these products originated.
  Current law already requires accurate labeling. This should not be a 
bill that we need to pass. This should be settled law, but the Biden-
Harris administration refuses to accept reality so they can, once 
again, pander to certain radical terrorist sympathizers in their 
political base.
  If the Biden-Harris administration goes through with reversing trade 
policy decision, it will legitimize anti-Semitic efforts to weaken and 
isolate our closest ally in the Middle East.
  In a time of global uncertainty, the last thing we should be doing is 
abandoning our strongest ally in the Middle East.
  Mr. Speaker, I am thankful that the House of Representatives is 
taking up this important bill, and I urge all my colleagues to vote for 
this important piece of legislation.
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).
  Ms. TLAIB. Anti-Arab, anti-Muslim, and anti-Palestinian hate was in 
full display at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday, a 
hearing that was intended, Mr. Speaker, to highlight the deadly hatred 
that killed a 6-year-old boy, Wadea. He was stabbed 26 times in 
Chicago. That is what our Senators used that moment for, to promote the 
very hate that is against many of our communities.
  Not to be outdone, my House colleagues are now pushing through 
legislation right here to spread anti-Arab, anti-Muslim, and anti-
Palestinian rhetoric. So I am not surprised to see this bill.

  What does this bill do?
  It seeks to erase Palestine from products produced by Palestinians on 
Palestinian farms. It requires products from large portions of 
Palestine, including on illegal settlements defined

[[Page H5353]]

under international law in the West Bank to be labeled, ``Made in 
Israel.''
  So let's be clear. A vote for this bill would further support the 
ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. A ``yes'' vote for this bill is 
erasing the existence of Palestinians.
  That is right, Mr. Speaker. Palestinians also have a right to exist.
  The provisions of this bill, Mr. Speaker, have hateful and 
discriminatory implications. We must stand against it and vote ``no.''
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bean).
  Mr. BEAN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, before I begin debate, I want to 
remind everybody who is watching in America that Hamas is still holding 
Americans hostage, and just recently they executed an American.
  We still want to urge this administration to do all they can to bring 
home not only Americans but release all of the hostages.
  Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism has no place in America. Disturbingly 
radical activists and members of the anti-Semitic BDS movement continue 
to wage economic warfare against the Jewish state.
  In a world where anti-Semitism and acts of violence against the 
Jewish people are more and more commonplace, we need to reassure our 
close ally that the United States will not delegitimize her authority 
nor punish her economy, rather, we must send a clear message that the 
United States stands with Israel.

                              {time}  1545

  We stand with Israel today. We will stand with Israel tomorrow. We 
will stand with Israel always.
  That is why I am proud to support Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and 
Chairman Jason Smith's bill prohibiting the Biden-Harris administration 
from assisting the anti-Semitic BDS movement in their efforts to target 
specific goods made in portions of the West Bank controlled entirely by 
Israel.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
join me in denouncing the anti-Semitic BDS movement and standing with 
Israel by voting in favor of H.R. 5179, the Anti-BDS Labeling Act.
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Nadler), the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee.
  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, this partisan bill does nothing to combat 
the BDS movement. Rather, it seeks to codify the policy of labeling 
products that come from West Bank settlements as made in Israel.
  In truth, such action is a backhanded attempt to illuminate a 
congressional green light for Israeli annexation of area C of the West 
Bank. Let's be clear. This measure is aimed at undermining American 
support for a two-state solution and, therefore, the Biden-Harris 
administration's critical and delicate efforts at diplomacy in the 
region.
  Mr. Speaker, as a lifelong Zionist and a deeply committed Jew, I take 
Israel's safety and security incredibly seriously, so seriously that I 
believe that Israel should not be used as a partisan football to 
advance an electoral agenda.
  Bringing this legislation to the floor is a Republican politically 
motivated misadventure to force Democrats to oppose a bill with ``anti-
BDS'' in the title weeks before an election.
  Republicans are seeking to use the United States' House of 
Representatives to strengthen the foreign policy legacy of a desperate 
former President Trump in the lead-up to November.
  Mr. Speaker, we should not stand for it. I am sick and tired of the 
Republicans' blatantly bad-faith maneuvers to further politicize 
Israel, especially as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the 
horrific attack of October 7, the deadliest day in Jewish history since 
the Holocaust.
  We deserve better, Mr. Speaker. The American people deserve better. 
The Israeli and Palestinian people deserve better.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to take the bait and to oppose 
this bill.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, first off, this bill was marked up in committee back in 
April, so it wasn't like it was done yesterday, and we have been 
bringing this forward.
  Also, Mr. Speaker, it is extremely important to note that what this 
bill does is it codifies current rules that were put into place by the 
Trump administration, but the Biden administration has rescinded almost 
everything of Trump's except for tariffs and this policy.
  They have not rescinded it. If Democrats thought it was bad, my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle would have rescinded it. I 
would hope the President's own party would support it, but we will see 
today.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. In closing, I 
urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my 
time to close.
  Mr. Speaker, the old saying is, ``knowledge is power.'' By codifying 
the Trump-era rule that currently labels items coming from Israel as 
originating in Israel, this body can empower individual Americans to 
buy products supporting our ally.
  I thank Representatives Claudia Tenney and Greg Steube, both of whom 
have been leaders on this issue, for sounding the alarm about the 
attempt by the Biden-Harris administration to weaken Israel.
  Congress should not even have to debate this topic, but the Customs 
and Border Protection rule in question provides no special treatment to 
Israel, but it does extend fair treatment to their exports. After more 
than 3 years in office, the Biden-Harris administration has not changed 
this policy.
  Unfortunately, reports earlier this year indicated that the Biden-
Harris administration was preparing to overturn this policy. Such a 
change could still happen at any time unless Congress acts.
  This proposed reversal would hurt both American consumers and our 
ally. Israel's economy is slowing from the strain of a war it didn't 
start. The last thing Israel needs as it fights to end this war are 
trade barriers that make it harder to choose Israeli products.
  The loss of revenue from American businesses and consumers would only 
magnify the harm done to Israel by this war. More importantly, this 
proposed reversal of sound policy seems to be driven more by political 
pandering than a consideration for Israel's ability to defend and 
provide for itself while under attack.
  House Republicans have made our commitment to supporting our friend 
and ally crystal clear. We have not left Israel wondering and worrying 
whether Republicans will support them.
  This bill is a clear opportunity to stand with Israel and empower 
American families, and I hope that the minority will join us in sending 
a clear message that Congress and America will support our ally.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the 
legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Ellzey). All time for debate has 
expired.
  Pursuant to House Resolution 1455, the previous question is ordered 
on the bill, as amended.
  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.
  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was 
read the third time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the bill.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further 
proceedings on this question will be postponed."

Mr. Speaker, I am both pleased and saddened to introduce 
a bill that helps relieve the ongoing humanitarian crisis unfolding in 
Palestine. I thank my colleagues Representatives Jayapal and Schakowsky 
for joining me as co-leads, with 65 original cosponsors and over 100 
national organization endorsements. This important bill will: (1) 
Repeal the funding prohibitions on UNRWA included in the FY24 
Appropriations bill and the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations 
Act of 2024; (2) Express a Sense of Congress that it supports 
appropriating critical funds to UNRWA for FY25; (3) Urge the Secretary 
of State, as soon as practicable, to rescind the temporary pause in 
funding for UNRWA and resume funding to UNRWA under current authorities 
of the Department of State; and (4) Require the Secretary of State to 
report to Congress on a quarterly basis on the steps UNRWA is taking to 
implement the recommendations contained in the independent outside 
review of the Agency's neutrality mechanisms and procedures.
  House-passed bills prohibiting UNRWA funding significantly erodes the 
United States' ability to provide life-saving assistance and basic 
services to Gaza's 2.2 million people. To date, over 40,000 
Palestinians have been killed and about 100,000 more have been 
seriously injured without access to functioning hospitals. Among the 
victims of this catastrophe are women and children. According to the 
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), over 150,000 pregnant women and 
new mothers are struggling to survive and access basic health care. 
Women in Gaza today are birthing children and having cesarean sections 
with no anesthesia. In addition, an estimated 700,000 women and girls 
in Gaza who require menstrual hygiene supplies are unable to manage 
their menstrual cycle in dignity, with some reports of contraceptive 
pills being taken to avoid the unhygienic menstrual conditions. Today, 
the fear of polio in children spreads across Gaza through fecal matter, 
limited clean drinking water, and destroyed infrastructure. 
Additionally, since October 7, thousands of Palestinian children have 
had one or both arms or legs amputated--without anesthesia. I want to 
reiterate--without anesthesia.
  We must prioritize addressing the humanitarian crisis and catastrophe 
in Gaza. UNRWA serves nearly six million Palestinian refugees across 
the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon and is the 
primary humanitarian aid organization operating in Gaza. The U.S. has 
historically been one of the largest financial supporters of UNRWA but 
paused funding following allegations by the Government of Israel that 
12 Agency employees had direct involvement in the October 7 terrorist 
attack.
  Following these allegations, the United Nations (UN) and UNRWA acted 
swiftly and decisively, immediately terminating the employees allegedly 
involved, ordering an independent outside review of the Agency's 
neutrality practices, and directing a review of the allegations by the 
UN's highest investigative body, the Office of Internal Oversight 
Services (OIOS).
  The outside review of UNRWA neutrality, led by former French Foreign 
Minister Catherine Colonna, concluded UNRWA has robust, well-developed 
internal mechanisms and that it possesses a more developed approach to 
neutrality than other similar UN or NGO entities. The review also 
identified steps the Agency can take to further ensure its commitment 
to neutrality. UNRWA welcomed the report and stated it is ``fully 
committed'' to implementing its recommendations. An American, UNRWA 
Deputy Commissioner-General Antonia De Meo, is leading the 
implementation effort.
  Just last month a donor review of UNRWA operations, funded in part by 
the U.S., concluded, ``The Agency's ability to deliver education, 
health, and social services at scale to one of the world's most 
vulnerable populations is unparalleled.''
  Following the UN's investigation and proactive commitments made by 
UNRWA toward complete accountability and reform, nearly all countries 
have resumed UNRWA funding including the European Union, United 
Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Finland, Germany, Japan, and Sweden. Only 
the U.S. has failed to restore this essential funding.
  International humanitarian NGOs and the major United Nations 
humanitarian organizations have made it clear that given UNRWA's role 
as the backbone of the humanitarian response, it is imperative that 
funding be restored and maintained to the Agency. These statements are 
especially relevant considering several of these humanitarian 
organizations would be required to drastically scale up their efforts 
at an impossible speed and scope to attempt to fill the humanitarian 
void that would be created should UNRWA cease to operate.
  Additionally, the U.S. joined 118 UN Member States in signing the 
Joint Commitments Initiative to Support UNRWA which stated that ``UNRWA 
is the backbone of all humanitarian response in Gaza and recognizing 
that no organization can replace or substitute UNRWA's capacity.''
  If we fail to act now, this escalating humanitarian crisis will only 
grow worse in Gaza, and further exacerbate tensions across the Middle 
East. It is in the strategic interest of both the U.S. and our allies, 
including Israel and Jordan, to resume and maintain full funding to 
UNRWA to stabilize the region and alleviate the humanitarian 
catastrophe that no other organization or agency will be able to 
effectively address.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this 
important bill to save lives and provide desperately needed 
humanitarian aid."

Under the Speaker's announced policy of 
January 9, 2023, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.
  Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, and still I rise.
  And still I rise today, and I stand alone. I stand alone, Mr. 
Speaker, because sometimes it is better to stand alone than not stand 
at all.
  I stand today, mindful of the words of the great Voltaire, the great 
intellectual who reminds us that it is dangerous, Mr. Speaker, to be 
right in affairs where established men are wrong.
  I rise today to take a stand and call to the attention of the Nation 
that I love, I love this country. I salute the flag. I stand for the 
national anthem. I sing the national anthem.
  I remind everyone that the greatness of America will not be measured 
by whether the Al Greens of the world will stand and sing and salute.
  The greatness of America will be measured by whether the Al Greens of 
the world will defend those who choose not to stand, sing, and salute, 
and I do. I defend them.
  I believe that the greatness of the country resides in our ability to 
have people that we disagree with stand before us, look us in the eye, 
announce their disagreement, and yet, we take that understanding that 
in this country, we can disagree and still have a great country.
  I stand today to call to the attention of the Nation and the many who 
may not know, but a good many may know what I am about to share, and I 
have with me evidence of what I speak.
  This, my dear friends, is from CNN by Andrew Carey, July 18, 2024, 
which would be a little more than 2 months, as I calculate things.
  And it reads: ``Israeli Lawmakers Vote Overwhelmingly Against 
Palestinian Statehood''--remember, July 18, 2024. It goes on to say: 
``Challenging U.S. Policy.'' This is the style of this article 
published by CNN.
  These are the words. ``The Biden administration received another 
rebuff from Israel Wednesday night--this time from the country's 
parliament.'' The parliament would be the Knesset. That would be 
similar to--not the same as but similar to our Congress.
  This is a rebuff, per CNN, from the parliament of Israel ``over the 
United States' longstanding support for the eventual establishment of a 
Palestinian state.''
  Now, this is important to me because since I have been in Congress, 
and I arrived in 2005, there has been a policy of a two-state solution, 
a state for Palestinians and a state for Israelis--longstanding.
  In fact, I have voted for it. I have voted to send money to Israel 
because I thought the two-state solution was the goal that we were all 
working toward. I have voted for more than $50 billion, thinking that 
we were moving toward a two-state solution.
  Well, this article goes on to say: ``A two-state solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been U.S. policy for decades''--I 
agree with that, it has--``but absent negotiations between the two 
sides, and a lack of sustained effort by the U.S.''--I shall repeat--
``a lack of sustained effort by the U.S. to make it happen.''
  Now, the contention in this article is that the United States has not 
made a sustained effort to make it happen.
  I believe that the Biden administration has. I have witnessed much of 
what the Biden administration is trying to do and has done.
  It goes on to read: ``On Wednesday evening, the Israeli Parliament 
made clear its position, voting by 68-9 to reject any creation of a 
Palestinian state.''
  Mr. Speaker, 68-9, the Israeli Parliament has voted to reject any 
creation of a Palestinian state. Many people don't know this. I am 
grateful that CNN has published it.
  It goes on. ``The Knesset of Israel firmly opposes the establishment 
of a Palestinian state west of the Jordan [River].''
  Actually, it says west of the Jordan, but we know that that is the 
Jordan River. The Jordan River is at the West Bank, and it is the West 
Bank of Jordan, not the West Bank of Israel. It is a part of what 
should be a Palestinian state. We have the West Bank.
  I will read this again because this is exceedingly important. ``The 
Knesset of Israel firmly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian 
state west of the Jordan [River].''

[[Page H5547]]

  Now, if you do that west of the Jordan River, that is another way of 
saying from the river to the sea, from the river to the sea, no 
Palestinian state from the river to the sea.
  Now, in this country, if you say from the river to the sea, Palestine 
will be free, well, that would be anti-Semitic.

  Well, what is it if the Knesset of Israel, the governing body, the 
Knesset of Israel--and this is not just some person on the street.
  ``The Knesset of Israel firmly opposes the establishment of a 
Palestinian state west of the Jordan [River].''
  From the river to the sea. That would include all of what at one time 
was known as Palestine. All of what at one time was known as Palestine.
  I challenge anyone within the sound of my voice or anyone who is 
seeing this to look for a map with Palestine on it, a map depicting the 
area today.
  It is not on the map. You may find it on some, but most maps will not 
have a place called Palestine on them today.
  Now, remember, in 1948, the place that we are now calling Israel, as 
you will see later on in this article, was called Palestine.
  The mandate was to have two states; one for Palestinians, one for 
Israelis. Somehow, this has metamorphosed into Israel in the minds of 
many people, but not in my mind.
  I am still on the two-state solution program that I voted for and 
sent more than $50 billion to help accomplish.

                              {time}  1200

  From the river to the sea, the Knesset of Israel firmly opposes a 
Palestinian state. This is the Knesset of Israel.
  It goes on to indicate: ``The establishment of a Palestinian state in 
the heart of the land of Israel''--``a Palestinian state in the heart 
of the land of Israel.''
  Remember, 1948, all of this land was called Palestine--well, I should 
say 1947, 1948. Then there was a mandate. Pursuant to the mandate, 
there were to be two states, a State of Israel and a state of 
Palestine.
  However, we find here that the Knesset of Israel has concluded that 
the establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the land of 
Israel--what happened to Palestine? What happened to the land that was 
to become a Palestinian state?
  ``The establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the land 
of Israel would pose an existential danger to the State of Israel and 
its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. . . .''
  What will happen if there is no state for the Palestinians? Will that 
be perpetual peace if there is no state for the Palestinians? What are 
you saying when you say that there will be no state for the 
Palestinians? What will there be? Will there be a one-state solution in 
a state called Israel?
  If that is the case, what will the Palestinians become? Will they 
have full citizenship in a state called Israel? Will they become a part 
of an apartheid state? What will happen to the Palestinians?
  It is a fair question to ask when you have the Israeli Knesset 
indicating that there will be no Palestinian state from the river to 
the sea, which is all of what used to be called Palestine.
  It goes on to indicate: ``perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
and destabilize the region,'' the declaration read.
  Well, there are many questions to be asked. I don't know that the 
answers are going to be readily available, but it seems to me that this 
is perspicuously clear, and there will be no Palestinian state if the 
current Israeli Government has its way.
  Let's go on. Same news article. It reads: ``Among those who backed 
it,'' meaning this resolution, ``was Benny Gantz, an opponent of Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Gantz' vote serves as a blow to those in 
Washington''--that would be us--``who see him as someone more inclined 
to seek a negotiated peace with Palestinians if he ever became Israel's 
leader.''
  Now we have the current Prime Minister, who is supportive of this 
resolution, and we have a potential Prime Minister, Mr. Benny Gantz, 
who has voted in favor of the resolution, as well.
  It reads: ``Instead, the resolution was `a signal to the 
international community that pressure to impose a Palestinian state on 
Israel is futile.' '' That is what this is supposed to signal, Mr. 
Speaker, futile.
  We are trying to negotiate a two-state solution when the Government 
of Israel has already passed a resolution that says we are not going to 
do that, there will be no two-state solution from the river to the sea.
  Can you imagine if someone in this country said there will be no 
Israel from the river to the sea, what our response would be?
  Do we not care about the Palestinians? Are they not human beings? Did 
they not have a place in the land that was called Palestine prior to 
1947, 1948? Do the Palestinians not matter to anybody? They ought to 
have a place in the land that was called Palestine.
  ``Instead, the resolution was `a signal to the international 
community that pressure to impose a Palestinian state on Israel is 
futile.' ''
  Why are we imposing a Palestinian state on Israel? We are imposing a 
Palestinian state pursuant to the mandate in a place called Palestine. 
We talk about these things as though Israel owns all of the land, and 
the Palestinians are foreigners who have somehow encroached upon the 
land of Israel.
  Futile. ``Instead, the resolution was `a signal to the international 
community that pressure to impose a Palestinian state on Israel is 
futile,' leader of the right-wing opposition `New Hope' Party, Gideon 
Saar, said, according to the Haaretz newspaper.''
  Now we have the Knesset saying no. From the river to the sea, there 
will be no Palestinian state.
  Let's get another opinion. This article has been published in many 
publications, including the Times of Israel. This one was taken from 
the Economic Times, but the essence of what is here has been published 
many times.
  Now, this reads: `` `We are not another star in American flag': 
Israel minister dismisses U.S. criticism over emigration of Gazan 
civilians.'' This is from January 3, 2024, not that long ago.
  Then this Israeli Prime Minister says: ``I really admire the United 
States of America, but with all due respect''--by the way, I am not 
angry with him for what I am about to read. I respect him. I am not 
upset. He says: ``I really admire the United States of America, but 
with all due respect, we are not another star in the American flag.''
  I agree with that. You are not another star in the American flag. No 
quarrel with that. Then he goes on to say--this is Ben Gvir--I want to 
make sure I get it right. No disrespect to you, sir. He heads the 
ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit party. This is what he said in the 
statement, ``not another star in the American flag.'' I agree, you are 
not.
  Then he adds: ``The United States is our best friend''--no 
disagreement there--``but before everything else, we will do what is 
good for the State of Israel.'' Now, that is a minister, part of the 
Israeli Government, said he is going to do what is in the best 
interests of Israel. Who can be upset with him for saying he is going 
to do what is in the best interests of his country? I think he probably 
loves his country like I love my country, so he is doing what is in the 
best interests of his country.
  Well, let's see what he thinks is in the best interests of his 
country. He goes on to say: ``Do what is good for the State of 
Israel.'' Then he adds: ``The emigration of hundreds of thousands from 
Gaza will allow residents''--this is being said parenthetically, but I 
will read it to you--``[of the border area] to return home and live in 
security and protect IDF soldiers.''

  We need to focus on the word ``emigration.'' Emigration is thought by 
some to mean you will leave and you may return, but here is what 
Webster said emigration is ``departure from a place of abode, natural 
home, or country for life or residence elsewhere.'' You are not coming 
back. He has no problem with emigration of hundreds of thousands from 
Gaza.
  Now, remember, Gaza and the West Bank are about all that the 
Palestinians can hope for at this point. Gaza and the West Bank, it is 
about all.
  Well, if they leave and they can't return, then that becomes more 
land for Israel, which then means that all that the Palestinians may 
hope for would be the West Bank, which, of course, is being encroached 
upon by the settlers.

[[Page H5548]]

  We find ourselves now with this minister indicating that he sees 
nothing wrong, it would be good for the State of Israel.
  Now, dear friends, friends, if this official can say that he will do 
what is good for the State of Israel, is it wrong for me to stand in 
the well of the Congress of the United States of America, born here in 
the United States of America, born in Louisiana, lived my life here in 
the United States of America, no desire to live anywhere else or move 
to any other place, is it wrong for me to say that I think I should do 
what is in the best interests of my country?
  He does what is in the best interests of his country; I do what is in 
the best interests of my country. I don't believe it is in the best 
interests of my country for us to continue to send billions of dollars 
to Israel when Israel's Knesset has voted from the river to the sea 
there will be no Palestinian state. From the river to the sea.
  My God, can you imagine what would happen if someone stood here in 
the well of the House of Representatives and said, from the river to 
the sea there will be no State of Israel? I don't have to imagine it. I 
have seen what happens. They get punished. They become an anti-Semite.
  What do we call the people who say, from the river to the sea, there 
will be no Palestinian state? Is there a double standard? Is there a 
double standard? I believe that there has to be a Palestinian state, so 
I am out of step with a good many people. Remember, however, I believe 
it is better to stand alone than to not stand at all.
  I don't think that it is good for the United States to continue to 
fund wars that a good many people in this country do not support. I am 
one of them. I think it is time to bring this war to an end. It is time 
for us to move toward a two-state solution, but also more importantly 
or equally as important, it is time to bring home the hostages. 
Negotiate so that the hostages can be released. It is time for them to 
be released. Let them go home.
  It is time for us to negotiate a serious two-state solution, but 
unfortunately the Knesset has said that it will not happen. This 
government says that it won't.

                              {time}  1215

  Well, I contend that if this government says that it won't, that it 
is okay. The government in Israel has every right to make these 
comments, but I also think that the government of the United States has 
every right to say: No more money, no more bombs, no more planes. You 
can do what you choose, you are a sovereign nation, but so is the 
United States of America.
  We are a sovereign Nation, Mr. Speaker. We have every right to say: 
That if you can't agree on the two-state solution that was mandated in 
1948, 1947, then okay.
  We don't have to support eternal conflict. We don't have to support 
the war where thousands of babies have been killed. We don't have to 
support the taking of the land from the Palestinians in the West Bank 
by the settlers. We don't have to support this.
  But I don't speak for us. I speak for myself and everybody who agrees 
with me, and a good many people do, by the way.
  I believe that our alternative to continuing to support the erosion 
of Palestinian land, the taking of Palestinian land, the declaring that 
there will be no Palestinian state, I think we should acknowledge that 
you are a sovereign nation, but so are we and that we will stand for 
what we have stood for for decades and that is a two-state solution.
  I compliment President Biden for making this a significant issue as 
we go through this time of great turmoil. I compliment him, but I think 
that we have reached a point now where there has to be a change in our 
policy. If Israel changed its policy, we can change ours. It is time 
for a change in the American policy.
  We can still be friends. The government of Israel, the country of 
Israel, will be our friend, but we don't have to support this war. We 
can ask for peace, and peace is the solution. There is not going to be 
a solution other than a peaceful two-state solution if you want peace.
  Now, if you want eternal conflict or if you want calm, if you want 
things to calm down, then you can have a one-state solution. Remember 
this: There is a calm in a dungeon where people are suffering. You can 
have calm in a dungeon, but that is not peace.
  If we want peace where neighbors can work together, you have to work 
toward it. You don't make peace with friends. They are already in a 
peaceful relationship. You have to make peace with people who have been 
antithetical to your views.
  It is time to say you don't have to make peace, but we don't have to 
support what you are doing.
  We have got an aircraft carrier with Americans out there at risk, 
nuclear powered. It is like a floating military base. When we send out 
these nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, I am told they can be fueled 
such that, if need be, they can stay for 25 years, and it has other 
ships and other aircraft there with it, some 90 aircraft.
  Our people are at risk because we have a state, by and through its 
government, who is saying there will be no two-state solution, and we 
have now what appears to be a conflict that is expanding and may 
eventually become a conflagration. It is expanding.
  I am for everybody having the right to defend themselves, and that 
has to include the State of Israel.
  I am also for peace, and peace is not going to be gained by 
continuing the process of making war. At some point, either someone is 
going to trigger something that will take this to a different place, or 
we will back off and try to have arrangements first and then peace to 
follow. All of the hostages should be brought home, all of them.
  Now, I close with this, Mr. Speaker. I have said that I don't think 
that our government should continue to support the war, but I don't 
speak for the government, so I am going to speak for myself now. I 
didn't speak for the government before. Everything that I have said, I 
speak for myself and all of those who agree with me.
  Here is what I say. If you bring a standalone bill to this floor, I 
am going to vote against it. If it is a standalone bill, just as the 
last one was--I believe it was the last--to send more funds to Israel, 
it is no secret, don't count me as a yea. Count me as a nay if you 
bring a standalone bill.
  Now, someone would say: Why wouldn't you just say that you are going 
to vote against any bill?
  Well, because I have been here long enough to have the good sense to 
know that these things can be packaged such that you have to hold your 
nose and your breath and close your eyes and turn your back and just 
vote for it. You may not want to, but the way it is packaged can push 
you into a corner, a place that you dare not go and don't want to be, 
but you do.
  If you bring a standalone bill, I am voting against it and probably 
will vote against others that are not standalone, depending on how they 
have been packaged. It is time for us to take a stand.
  There is a song, a spiritual song, that has the words ``just stand,'' 
``just stand.'' ``After you've done all you can''--and I am doing all 
that I can.
  After you have done all that you can, knowing that it is dangerous to 
be right in affairs where established men are wrong, after you have 
done all that you can, just stand. Just stand. Stand for liberty and 
justice for all as represented by that flag behind the Speaker.
  Stand with Carlyle: ``No lie can live forever.''
  Stand with William Cullen Bryant: ``Truth, crushed to earth, shall 
rise again.''
  Stand with Dr. King: ``The arc of the moral universe is long, but it 
bends toward justice.''
  Stand knowing that the words of C.A. Tindley are powerful and right:

       Harder yet may be the fight;
       Right may often yield to might;
       Wickedness high may seem to reign;
       And Satan's cause may seem to gain.
       But there is a God that rules above,
       With a hand of power and a heart of love;
       And when I am right, I just believe that God will help me 
     fight.

  Harder yet may be the fight, Mr. Speaker.
  Harder may be the fight.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the 
following article published in the August/September issue of the 
Capitol Hill Citizen by my constituent, Ralph Nader. I do not endorse 
everything put forward in the article; however, I believe it is 
important that it be included as a matter of free speech and 
discussion.

       One way that the annihilator--Israeli Prime Minister 
     Benjamin Netanyahu--flipped off the meek urgings of President 
     Joe Biden and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to 
     ``minimize civilian casualties'' in Gaza was to say--Don't 
     lecture me--look at what you did to civilians in Hiroshima (1 
     40,000 dead), Nagasaki (70,000 dead) and Dresden (25,000 
     dead) to crush your enemies. That's 235,000 dead in two 
     nations with a population at the time of 150 million.
       In Gaza, a tiny enclave of 2.3 million long besieged and 
     impoverished people, nearly half of them children, the 
     Israeli regime, a military nuclear superpower, backed 
     unconditionally by the United States government and its 
     demanding lobbies, has far exceeded that three city 
     devastation.
       The following probative evidence and professional 
     assessments point to a death toll of over 300,000 
     Palestinians in Gaza with that number at least doubling by 
     end of the year.
       Why then is the reviled Hamas' official death count now at 
     about 41,000, accepted by the mass media and most 
     governments, regardless of their view for or against the 
     genocide in Gaza?
       Hamas is vested in an undercount to temper accusations by 
     their own people that it has not protected them. (Hamas badly 
     underestimated the total savagery of the Israeli response to 
     its October 7 attack through a mysteriously collapsed 
     multitiered Israeli border security complex.) The Israeli 
     government also prefers an undercount to temper the rising 
     level of international condemnation and boycotts.
       As a result, the slow rise in the official fatality and 
     injury undercount leaves a widening gap each day compared to 
     the actual toll of death and morbidity on the ground. 
     Normally, there would be an ongoing ``gold standard'' 
     epidemiological estimate.
       But war epidemiology has historically been understudied. A 
     2015 article in the journal Epidemiology found that for the 
     epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome there had 
     been nearly 2.5 academic articles per death, while for the 
     epidemiology of wars and armed conflict there are only 
     0.00005 articles per death.
       Gaza presents additional obstacles. For years, Netanyahu 
     has barred entry by journalists, including Israelis, from 
     free and independent reporting there.
       In early July 2024, more than 70 media and civil society 
     organizations signed an open letter urging Israel to give 
     journalists independent access to Gaza.
       The organizations--which include the Associated Press, 
     Agence France-Presse, BBC, CNN, The Guardian, the New York 
     Times, and the Washinglon Post--said that no independent 
     media access to Gaza has been permitted since the start of 
     the war.
       ``This effective ban on foreign reporting has placed an 
     impossible and unreasonable burden on local reporters to 
     document a war through which they are living,'' they wrote.
       ``More than 100 journalists have been killed since the 
     start of the war and those who remain are working in 
     conditions of extreme deprivation. The result is that 
     information from Gaza is becoming harder and harder to obtain 
     and that the reporting which does get through is subject to 
     repeated questions over its veracity.''
       Similarly, international humanitarian analysts have been 
     excluded.
       ``Aid groups have been pointing to Israel restricting the 
     flow of assistance into the territory as a major driver of 
     the crisis,'' Tharoor repeated. ``Some prominent Israeli

[[Page E1001]]

     officials openly champion stymying these transfers of aid.''
       Martin Griffiths, the United Nations lead humanitarian 
     officer said weeks ago that ``life is draining out of Gaza at 
     terrifying speed.''
       ``U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned of an 
     `unknown number of people'--believed to be in the tens of 
     thousands--lying under the rubble of buildings brought down 
     by Israeli strikes,'' the Post reported.
       On April 5, 2024, then special envoy for Biden on 
     Humanitarian Affairs, David Satterfield told the American 
     Jewish Committee ``there is an imminent risk of famine for 
     the majority, if not all, the 2.2 million population of 
     Gaza.''
       ``This is not a point in debate. It is an established fact, 
     which the United States, its experts, the international 
     community, its experts assess and believe is real,'' 
     Satterfield said.
       A few days later, USAID administrator Samantha Power agreed 
     that it was ``credible'' to assess that famine was already 
     occurring in Gaza.
       UNICEF, Save the Children, the World Food Program, the 
     International Rescue Committee, the UN High Commissioner for 
     Human Rights, the Palestine Red Crescent Society, and Doctors 
     Without Borders are all relating the same catastrophic 
     conditions getting worse.
       Some of these groups have lost valiant staff to Israeli 
     attacks, including while sheltering in clearly marked UNWRA 
     and Red Crescent buildings and vehicles. Israeli war crime 
     violations of international law are legion, according to 
     experts in the field from many nations.
       These groups have years of experience working in disaster 
     areas around the world and their reputation for reporting 
     conditions is first rate. They know full well that the 
     terrifying amputations and other disabilities and the 
     corrosive PTSD on civilians, especially children, will long 
     continue for those survivors.
       Against this background, the mass media ditto heading the 
     Hamas undercount would have people believe that 98 percent of 
     the Gaza population has survived the Israeli onslaught. This 
     is lethally impossible.
       In July, the prestigious UK medical journal The Lancet put 
     out a study of the Gaza undercount conservatively concluding 
     that ``it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 
     or even more deaths could be attributable to the current 
     conflict in Gaza.''
       Finally, there is eye witness clinical evidence by western 
     physicians, nurses and medical support staff returning from 
     their tours of duty in the remaining badly damaged hospitals. 
     Their accounts offer more probative evidence. In a largely 
     ignored, documented letter to Joe Biden, Dr. Jill Biden and 
     Kamala Harris, dated July 25, 2024, 45 of these doctors 
     recounted their clinical observations.
       Here are a few of them:
       ``I've never seen such horrific injuries, on such a massive 
     scale, with so few resources. Our bombs are cutting down 
     women and children by the thousands. Their mutilated bodies 
     are a monument to cruelty.''--Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, trauma and 
     critical care surgeon.
       ``Gaza was the first time I held a baby's brains in my 
     hand. The first of many.''--Dr. Mark Perlmutter, orthopedic 
     and hand surgeon.
       ``Specifically, every one of us on a daily basis treated 
     preteen children who were shot in the head and chest,'' the 
     doctors wrote in the letter to the Bidens and Harris. ``With 
     only marginal exceptions, everyone in Gaza is sick, injured, 
     or both.''
       ``President and Dr. Biden, we wish you could see the 
     nightmares that plague so many of us since we have returned--
     dreams of children maimed and mutilated by our weapons, and 
     their inconsolable mothers begging us to save them,'' they 
     wrote. ``We wish you could hear the cries and screams our 
     consciences will not let us forget. We cannot believe that 
     anyone would continue arming the country that is deliberately 
     killing these children after seeing what we have seen.''
       ``Israel has targeted our colleagues in Gaza for death, 
     disappearance, and torture,'' the doctors wrote. ``We believe 
     that the death toll from this conflict is many times higher 
     than what is reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health.'' ``We 
     urge you to end this madness now.''
       Ironically, in December 2023, Dr. Jill Biden told spouse 
     Joe Biden: ``Stop it, stop it now, Joe.'' (Source: Joe 
     Biden). The doctors who signed the letter are asking for a 
     personal meeting with the Bidens and Kamala Harris."
